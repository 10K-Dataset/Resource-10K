ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Entergy operates primarily through two business segments: Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.

•

The

Utility

business segment includes the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric power in portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans; and operation of a small natural gas distribution business.

•

The

Entergy Wholesale Commodities

business segment includes the ownership, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants located in the northern United States and the sale of the electric power produced by its operating plants to wholesale customers.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities also provides services to other nuclear power plant owners and owns interests in non-nuclear power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers.  See “

Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business

” below for discussion of the operation and planned shutdown and sale of each of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants.

Following are the percentages of Entergy’s consolidated revenues generated by its operating segments and the percentage of total assets held by them.  Net income or loss generated by the operating segments is discussed in the sections that follow.

See Note 13 to the financial statements for further financial information regarding Entergy’s business segments.

See Note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion of the restructuring of the decommissioning trust fund investment holdings, the IRS audit settlement, and the state income tax audit.

Operating Revenues

Utility

Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing


to


:

The Utility operating companies’ results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income.  “Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income” includes the revenue variance associated with these items.

The return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers resulted from activity at the Utility operating companies in response to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  The return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes began in second quarter 2018.  In 2019, $262 million was returned to customers through reductions in operating revenues as compared to $641 million in 2018.  There is no effect on net income as the reductions in operating revenues were offset by reductions in income tax expense.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to:

•

an increase in formula rate plan revenues effective September 2018 and an interim increase in formula rate plan revenues effective June 2019 due to the inclusion of the first-year revenue requirement for the St. Charles Power Station, each at Entergy Louisiana, as approved by the LPSC;

•

an increase in formula rate plan rates effective with the first billing cycle of January 2019 at Entergy Arkansas, as approved by the APSC;



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

•

a base rate increase effective October 2018 at Entergy Texas, as approved by the PUCT; and

•

an increase in formula rate plan revenues effective with the first billing cycle of July 2019 and an accrual in the fourth quarter 2019 for the interim capacity rate adjustment to the formula rate plan to recover non-fuel related costs of acquiring the Choctaw Generating Station, each at Entergy Mississippi, as approved by the MPSC.

See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the regulatory proceedings discussed above.

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease of 1,587 GWh, or 1%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities

Operating revenues for Entergy Wholesale Commodities decreased from $1,469 million for 2018 to $1,295 million for 2019 primarily due to the shutdown of Pilgrim in May 2019 and lower capacity prices, partially offset by higher volume in the remaining Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant nuclear fleet resulting from fewer outage days.

Following are key performance measures for Entergy Wholesale Commodities for


and


:

(a)

The reduction in owned capacity is due to the shutdown of the 688 MW Pilgrim plant in May 2019.

Other Income Statement Items

Utility

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased from $2,501 million for 2018 to $2,563 million for 2019 primarily due to:

•

an increase of $34 million in information technology costs primarily due to higher costs related to applications and infrastructure support, enhanced cyber security, and upgrades and maintenance;

•

an increase of $32 million in spending on initiatives to explore new customer products and services;

•

an increase of $21 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to higher incentive-based compensation accruals in 2019 as compared to prior year;

•

a $15 million gain in 2018 from the sale of Entergy Louisiana’s Willow Glen Power Station.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the sale of Willow Glen;

•

an increase of $12 million in distribution operations and asset management costs primarily due to higher advanced metering customer education costs and higher contract costs for meter reading services; and



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

•

an $11 million write-off in 2019 of specific costs related to the potential construction of scrubbers at the White Bluff plant at Entergy Arkansas.

The increase was partially offset by:

•

a decrease of $30 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to a lower scope of work performed in 2019 as compared to 2018;

•

the effects of recording in 2019 final judgments to resolve claims in the ANO damages case and the River Bend damages case both against the DOE related to spent nuclear fuel storage costs.  The damages awarded include the reimbursement of approximately $17 million of spent nuclear fuel storage costs previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expense.  See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation;

•

a decrease of $11 million in energy efficiency costs due to the timing of recovery from customers; and

•

a decrease of $9 million as a result of the deferral in 2019 by Entergy New Orleans of 2018 costs related to its rate case and a system conversion for Algiers customers as a result of the 2018 combined rate case resolution approved by the City Council.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case resolution.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to:

•

additions to plant in service, including the St. Charles Power Station;

•

a reduction of approximately $26 million in depreciation expense recorded in the third quarter 2018 as part of a settlement approved by the FERC in the Unit Power Sales Agreement proceeding; and

•

new depreciation rates at Entergy Mississippi, as approved by the MPSC, and at Entergy Texas, as approved by the PUCT.

The increase was partially offset by updated depreciation rates used in calculating Grand Gulf plant depreciation and amortization expenses under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, as approved by the FERC.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the Unit Power Sales Agreement proceeding.

Other regulatory charges (credits) include the following significant activity:

•

a regulatory charge recorded in second quarter 2018 to reflect the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes per an agreement approved by the MPSC in June 2018 that resulted in a reduction in net utility plant of $127 million.  There was no effect on net income as the regulatory charge was offset by a reduction in income tax expense in 2018;

•

regulatory charges of $73 million recorded in 2018 to reflect the effects of regulatory agreements to return the benefits of the lower income tax rate in 2018 to Entergy Louisiana customers; and

•

regulatory charges of $25 million recorded in 2018 to reflect the effects of a provision in the settlement reached in the 2018 rate case proceeding to return the benefits of the lower federal income tax rate in 2018 to Entergy Texas customers.

See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance in March 2019 of $525 million of 4.20% Series mortgage bonds by Entergy Louisiana and the issuance in March 2019 of $350 million of 4.20% Series mortgage bonds by Entergy Arkansas.  See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of long-term debt.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased from $192 million for 2018 to $157 million for 2019 primarily due to a larger exercise of resupply options in 2018 provided for in purchase power agreements where Entergy Wholesale



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Commodities may elect to supply power from another source when plants are not running.

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased from $808 million for 2018 to $678 million for 2019 primarily due to:

•

a decrease of $75 million in nuclear generation expenditures primarily due to the absence of other operation and maintenance expenses from the Pilgrim plant, after it was shut down in May 2019 and subsequently sold.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of the sale of the Pilgrim plant; and

•

a decrease of $44 million in severance and retention expenses.  Severance and retention expenses were incurred in 2019 and 2018 due to management’s strategy to exit the Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant power business.  See “

Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business

” below for a discussion of management’s strategy to shut down and sell all of the remaining plants in Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ merchant nuclear fleet.  See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of severance and retention expenses resulting from management’s strategy to shut down and sell all of the remaining plants in Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ merchant nuclear fleet.

Asset write-offs, impairments, and related charges for 2019 include a loss of $190 million ($156 million net-of-tax) as a result of the sale of the Pilgrim plant in August 2019 and impairment charges of $100 million ($79 million net-of-tax) primarily related to nuclear refueling outage spending and expenditures for capital assets.  Asset write-offs, impairments, and related charges for 2018 include impairment charges of $532 million ($421 million net-of-tax) related to asset retirement obligation revisions, nuclear fuel spending, nuclear refueling outage spending, and expenditures for capital assets.  These costs were charged to expense as incurred as a result of the impaired fair value of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants’ long-lived assets due to the significantly reduced remaining estimated operating lives associated with management’s strategy to exit the Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant power business.  See “

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

-

Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business

” below for a discussion of management’s strategy to shut down and sell all of the remaining plants in Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ merchant nuclear fleet.  See Note 9 to the financial statements for a discussion of asset retirement obligations.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for a discussion of the impairment of long-lived assets and the sale of the Pilgrim plant.

Other income increased primarily due to higher gains on decommissioning trust fund investments.  See Notes 15 and 16 to the financial statements for a discussion of decommissioning trust fund investments.

Other expenses increased primarily due to an increase in nuclear refueling outage expenses as a result of the amortization in 2019 of costs associated with a refueling outage at Palisades.

Income Taxes

See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates, and for additional discussion regarding income taxes.

The effective income tax rate for 2019 was (15.6%).  The difference in the effective income tax rate versus the federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes, certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items, tax differences related to the allowance for equity funds used during construction, recognition of a deferred tax asset associated with a previously unrecognized net operating loss carryover, a charitable tax deduction, and the effects of restructuring transactions within Entergy Wholesale Commodities, partially offset by state income taxes and valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets associated with the disposition of Vermont Yankee and the carryover of business interest expense.  See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of the effects and regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of the internal restructuring at Entergy Wholesale Commodities.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for a discussion of the tax effects of the Vermont Yankee disposition.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

The effective income tax rate for 2018 was 595%.  The difference in the effective income tax rate versus the statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes, the tax effects of a restructuring within the Utility, and a restructuring of the investment holdings in one of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear plant decommissioning trusts for which additional tax basis is now recoverable.  See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of the effects and regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of the restructuring.

See “

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

-

Results of Operations

” in Entergy’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for discussion of results of operations for 2018 compared to 2017.

Income Tax Legislation

On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act).  As a result of the Act, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries re-measured their deferred tax assets and liabilities in December 2017 to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% that was effective January 1, 2018.  Note 3 to the financial statements contains additional discussion of the effect of the Act on 2017, 2018, and 2019 results of operations and financial position, the provisions of the Act, and the uncertainties associated with accounting for the Act, and Note 2 to the financial statements discusses the regulatory proceedings that have considered the effects of the Act.

Entergy’s operating cash flows have been and will be reduced by the Act, most significantly over the time that the Registrant Subsidiaries are returning unprotected excess deferred income taxes to customers.  Rate base is expected to increase over time as a consequence of the Act as the excess deferred income taxes are returned to customers.  Entergy financed its incremental cash requirements as a consequence of the Act through a combination of Registrant Subsidiary debt and Entergy Corporation debt and equity.  In June 2018, Entergy Corporation marketed an equity offering of 15.3 million shares of common stock.  In lieu of issuing equity at the time of the offering, Entergy entered into forward sale agreements with several counterparties.  In December 2018, Entergy physically settled a portion of its obligations under the forward sale agreements by delivering 6.8 million shares of its common stock in exchange for cash proceeds of $500 million.  In May 2019, Entergy physically settled its remaining obligations under the forward sale agreements by delivering 8.5 million shares of common stock in exchange for cash proceeds of $608 million.  See Note 7 to the financial statements for further discussion of the forward sale agreements.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business

Entergy Wholesale Commodities includes the ownership of the following nuclear reactors as of December 31, 2019:

As discussed below, Entergy sold its FitzPatrick plant to Exelon in March 2017, transferred its Vermont Yankee plant to NorthStar in January 2019, and sold its Pilgrim plant to Holtec in August 2019.  The Palisades and Indian Point plants are under contract to be sold, subject to certain conditions, after they are shut down.  Entergy also sold the Rhode Island State Energy Center, a natural gas-fired combined cycle generating plant, in December 2015.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

These plant sales and contracts to sell are the result of a strategy that Entergy has undertaken to manage and reduce the risk of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, which includes taking actions to exit the merchant power business.  Management evaluated the challenges for each of the plants based on a variety of factors such as their market for both energy and capacity, their size, their contracted positions, and the amount of investment required to continue to operate and maintain the safety and integrity of the plants, including the estimated asset retirement costs.  Changes to current assumptions regarding the operating life of a plant, the decommissioning timeline and process, or the length of time that Entergy will continue to own a plant could result in revisions to the asset retirement obligations and affect compliance with certain NRC minimum financial assurance requirements for meeting obligations to decommission the plants.  Increases in the asset retirement obligations are likely to result in an increase in operating expense in the period of a revision.  The possibility that a plant may have an operating life shorter than previously assumed could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trust funds, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities also includes the ownership of two non-operating nuclear facilities, Big Rock Point in Michigan and Indian Point 1 in New York that were acquired when Entergy purchased the Palisades and Indian Point 2 nuclear plants, respectively.  These facilities are in various stages of the decommissioning process.  Big Rock Point is under contract to be sold with the Palisades plant and Indian Point 1 is under contract to be sold with the Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 plants.  In addition, Entergy Wholesale Commodities provides operations and management services, including decommissioning-related services, to nuclear power plants owned by non-affiliated entities in the United States.  A relatively minor portion of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is the ownership of interests in non-nuclear power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers.

Shutdown and Disposition of Vermont Yankee

On December 29, 2014, the Vermont Yankee plant ceased power production and entered its decommissioning phase.

In November 2016, Entergy entered into an agreement to transfer 100% of the membership interests in Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, LLC to a subsidiary of NorthStar.  Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee was the owner of the Vermont Yankee plant.  The transaction included the transfer of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund and the asset retirement obligation for the spent fuel management and decommissioning of the plant.

In March 2018, Entergy and NorthStar entered into a settlement agreement and a Memorandum of Understanding with State of Vermont agencies and other interested parties that set forth the terms on which the agencies and parties supported the Vermont Public Utility Commission’s approval of the transaction.  The agreements provided additional financial assurance for decommissioning, spent fuel management and site restoration, and detailed the site restoration standards.  In October 2018 the NRC issued an order approving the application to transfer Vermont Yankee’s license to NorthStar for decommissioning.  In December 2018 the Vermont Public Utility Commission issued an order approving the transaction consistent with the Memorandum of Understanding’s terms.  On January 11, 2019, Entergy and NorthStar closed the transaction.

Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee had an outstanding credit facility that was used to pay for dry fuel storage costs.  This credit facility was guaranteed by Entergy Corporation.  A subsidiary of Entergy assumed the obligations under the credit facility.  At the closing of the sale transaction, NorthStar caused Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, renamed NorthStar Vermont Yankee, to issue a $139 million promissory note to the Entergy subsidiary that assumed the credit facility obligations.  The amount of the note includes the balance outstanding on the credit facility, as well as borrowing fees and costs incurred by Entergy in connection with the credit facility.

With the receipt of the NRC and Vermont Public Utility Commission approvals and the resolution among the parties of the significant conditions of the sale, Entergy concluded that as of December 31, 2018 Vermont Yankee was in held for sale status.  Entergy accordingly evaluated Vermont Yankee’s asset retirement obligation in light of the terms of the transaction and evaluated the remaining values of the Vermont Yankee assets.  These evaluations resulted in an increase in the asset retirement obligation and $173 million of related asset impairment and other charges in the

fourth quarter 2018.  See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the asset retirement obligation.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the closing of the Vermont Yankee transaction.

Sale of FitzPatrick

In October 2015, Entergy determined that it would close the FitzPatrick plant.  The original expectation was to shut down the FitzPatrick plant at the end of its fuel cycle in January 2017.

In August 2016, Entergy entered into a trust transfer agreement with NYPA to transfer the decommissioning trust funds and decommissioning liabilities for the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants to Entergy.  When Entergy purchased Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick in 2000 from NYPA, NYPA retained the decommissioning trust funds and the decommissioning liabilities.  NYPA and Entergy subsidiaries executed decommissioning agreements, which specified their decommissioning obligations.  NYPA had the right to require the Entergy subsidiaries to assume each of the decommissioning liabilities provided that it assigned the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to the Entergy subsidiaries.  Under the original agreements, if the decommissioning liabilities were retained by NYPA, the Entergy subsidiaries would perform the decommissioning of the plants at a price equal to the lesser of a pre-specified level or the amount in the decommissioning trust funds.  At the time of the acquisition of the plants Entergy recorded a contract asset that represented an estimate of the present value of the difference between the stipulated contract amount for decommissioning the plants less the decommissioning costs estimated in independent decommissioning cost studies.  The asset was increased by monthly accretion based on the applicable discount rate necessary to ultimately provide for the estimated future value of the decommissioning contract.  The monthly accretion was recorded as interest income.  As a result of the agreement with NYPA, in the third quarter 2016, Entergy removed the contract asset from its balance sheet, and recorded receivables for the beneficial interests in the decommissioning trust funds and asset retirement obligations for the decommissioning liabilities.  The decommissioning trust funds for the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants were transferred to Entergy by NYPA in January 2017.

In August 2016, Entergy entered into an agreement to sell the FitzPatrick plant to Exelon.  NRC approval of the sale was received in March 2017.  The transaction closed in March 2017 for a purchase price of $110 million, which included a $10 million non-refundable signing fee paid in August 2016, in addition to the assumption by Exelon of certain liabilities related to the FitzPatrick plant, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of $16 million.  At the transaction close, Exelon paid an additional $8 million for the proration of certain expenses prepaid by Entergy.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of the sale of FitzPatrick.  As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, as a result of the sale of FitzPatrick, Entergy re-determined the plant’s tax basis, resulting in a $44 million income tax benefit in the first quarter 2017

.

Shutdown and Sale of Pilgrim

In October 2015, Entergy determined that it would close the Pilgrim plant.  The decision came after management’s extensive analysis of the economics and operating life of the plant following the NRC’s decision in September 2015 to place the plant in its “multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column” (Column 4) of its Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix.  In January 2019 the NRC found that the Pilgrim plant had completed the corrective actions required to address the concerns that led to the plant’s placement in Column 4 and had demonstrated sustained improvement.  Pilgrim ceased operations in May 2019.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the impairment charges associated with the decision to cease operations earlier than expected.

On July 30, 2018, Entergy entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Holtec International to sell to a Holtec subsidiary 100% of the equity interests in Entergy Nuclear Generation Company, LLC, the owner of Pilgrim, for $1,000 (subject to adjustments for net liabilities and other amounts).  On August 22, 2019 the NRC approved the transfer of Pilgrim’s facility licenses to Holtec.  At that time, hearing requests filed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and Pilgrim Watch challenging Holtec’s financial qualifications and the sufficiency of the NRC’s review of the associated environmental impacts of the license transfer were pending with the NRC Commissioners. The NRC approval order included a condition acknowledging the NRC’s longstanding authority to modify, condition, or rescind



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

the license transfer order as a result of any hearing that may be conducted.  On August 26, 2019, as permitted by the August 22 order, Entergy and Holtec closed the transaction.  On September 3 and 4, 2019, Pilgrim Watch and Massachusetts each filed with the NRC motions to stay the effectiveness of the August 22 order pending the resolution of the NRC hearing process.  On December 17, 2019, the NRC denied the Pilgrim Watch and Massachusetts stay motions.  The NRC has not yet ruled on the Pilgrim Watch and Massachusetts hearing requests.  In addition, on September 25, 2019, Massachusetts filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, asking the court to vacate the NRC’s August 22 license transfer approval order and related approvals.  On November 6, 2019, the court granted Entergy and Holtec intervenor status in the U.S. Court of Appeals proceeding.  On November 22, 2019, Entergy and Holtec filed a motion to dismiss Massachusetts’ petition; the NRC also filed a motion to dismiss on the same date.  On January 17, 2020, the States of New York, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Vermont filed a brief as

amici curiae

in support of Massachusetts’s petition.  The court of appeals has not yet ruled on Massachusetts’ initial petition or on the NRC or Entergy/Holtec motions to dismiss.  On January 22, 2020, Massachusetts filed a second petition with the D.C. Circuit asking the court to review the NRC’s December 17 order denying its stay motion.  On February 12, 2020, the court granted Entergy and Holtec intervenor status in the proceeding on the second petition and consolidated the proceedings for Massachusetts’ two petitions.

The sale of Entergy Nuclear Generation Company, LLC to Holtec included the transfer of the nuclear decommissioning trust and obligation for spent fuel management and plant decommissioning.  The transaction resulted in a loss of $190 million ($156 million net-of-tax) in 2019.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the closing of the Pilgrim transaction.

Planned Shutdown and Sale of Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3

In April 2007, Entergy submitted to the NRC a joint application to renew the operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 for an additional 20 years.  In January 2017, Entergy reached a settlement with New York State, several State agencies, and Riverkeeper, Inc., under which Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 will cease commercial operation by April 30, 2020 and April 30, 2021, respectively, subject to certain conditions, including New York State’s withdrawal of opposition to Indian Point’s license renewals and issuance of contested permits and similar authorizations.  Operations may be extended up to four additional years for each unit by mutual agreement of Entergy and New York State based on an exigent reliability need for Indian Point generation.  In September 2018 the NRC issued renewed operating licenses for Indian Point 2 through April 2024 and for Indian Point 3 through April 2025.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the impairment charges associated with the decision to shut down the Indian Point plants.

Other provisions of the settlement include termination of all then-existing investigations of Indian Point by the parties to the agreement, which include the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, the New York State Department of State, the New York State Department of Public Service, the New York State Department of Health, and the New York State Attorney General.  The settlement recognizes the right of New York State agencies to pursue new investigations and enforcement actions with respect to new circumstances or existing conditions that become materially exacerbated.

Another provision of the settlement obligates Entergy to establish a $15 million fund for environmental projects and community support.  Apportionment and allocation of funds to beneficiaries are to be determined by mutual agreement of New York State and Entergy.  The settlement recognizes New York State’s right to perform an annual inspection of Indian Point, with scope and timing to be determined by mutual agreement.

In April 2019, Entergy entered into an agreement to sell, directly or indirectly, 100% of the equity interests in the subsidiaries that own Indian Point 1, Indian Point 2, and Indian Point 3, after Indian Point 3 has been shut down and defueled, to a Holtec International subsidiary for decommissioning.  The sale includes the transfer of the licenses, spent fuel, decommissioning liabilities, and nuclear decommissioning trusts for the three units.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

The transaction is subject to closing conditions, including approval from the NRC.  In November 2019, Entergy and Holtec submitted a license transfer application to the NRC.  In January 2020 the NRC indicated that the application contained sufficient information for it to conduct its technical review and anticipated that it would complete its review in January 2021.  Entergy and Holtec also submitted a petition to the New York State Public Service Commission in November 2019 seeking an order from the New York Public Service Commission disclaiming jurisdiction or abstaining from review of the transaction or, alternatively, approving the transaction.  Closing is also conditioned on obtaining from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation an agreement related to Holtec’s decommissioning plan as being consistent with applicable standards.  The transaction closing is targeted for May 2021, following the defueling of Indian Point 3.

As consideration for the transfer to Holtec of its interest in Indian Point, Entergy will receive nominal cash consideration.  The Indian Point transaction is expected to result in a loss based on the difference between Entergy’s adjusted net investment in the subsidiaries at closing and the sale price net of any agreed adjustments.  As of December 31, 2019, Entergy’s adjusted net investment in the Indian Point units was $240 million.  The primary variables in the ultimate loss that Entergy will incur are the values of the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the asset retirement obligations at closing, the financial results from plant operations until the closing, and the level of any unrealized deferred tax balances at closing.  The terms of the transaction include limitations on withdrawals from the nuclear decommissioning trusts to fund decommissioning activities and controls on how Entergy manages the investment of nuclear decommissioning trust assets between signing and closing; however, the agreement does not require a minimum level of funding in the nuclear decommissioning trusts as a condition to closing.

Planned Shutdown and Sale of Palisades

Most of the Palisades output is sold under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Consumers Energy, entered into when the plant was acquired in 2007, that is scheduled to expire in 2022.  The PPA prices currently exceed market prices and escalate each year, up to $61.50/MWh in 2022.  In December 2016, Entergy reached an agreement with Consumers Energy to amend the existing PPA to terminate early, on May 31, 2018.  Pursuant to the agreement to amend the PPA, Consumers Energy would pay Entergy $172 million for the early termination of the PPA.  The PPA amendment agreement was subject to regulatory approvals, including approval by the Michigan Public Service Commission.  Separately, Entergy intended to shut down the Palisades nuclear power plant permanently on October 1, 2018, after refueling in the spring of 2017 and operating through the end of that fuel cycle.

In September 2017 the Michigan Public Service Commission issued an order conditionally approving the PPA amendment transaction, but only granting Consumers Energy recovery of $136.6 million of the $172 million requested early termination payment.  As a result, Entergy and Consumers Energy agreed to terminate the PPA amendment agreement.  Entergy continues to operate Palisades under the current PPA with Consumers Energy, instead of shutting down in the fall of 2018 as previously planned.  Entergy intends to shut down the Palisades nuclear power plant permanently no later than May 31, 2022.  As a result of the increase in the expected operating life of the plant, the expected probability-weighted undiscounted net cash flows as of September 30, 2017 exceeded the carrying value of the plant and related assets.  Accordingly, nuclear fuel spending, nuclear refueling outage spending, and expenditures for capital assets incurred at Palisades after September 30, 2017 are no longer charged to expense as incurred, but recorded as assets and depreciated or amortized, subject to the typical periodic impairment reviews prescribed in the accounting rules.  See Note 9 to the financial statements for discussion of the associated asset retirement obligation revision, see Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the impairment charges associated with the decision to cease operations at Palisades, and see Note 19 to the financial statements for discussion of the updated calculation of the PPA liability amortization.

On July 30, 2018, Entergy entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Holtec International to sell to a Holtec subsidiary 100% of the equity interests in Entergy Nuclear Palisades, LLC, the owner of Palisades and the Big Rock Point Site.  The sale of Entergy Nuclear Palisades will include the transfer of the nuclear decommissioning trust and obligation for spent fuel management and plant decommissioning.  At the closing of the sale transaction, the Holtec



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

subsidiary will pay $1,000 (subject to adjustment for net liabilities and other amounts) for the equity interests in Entergy Nuclear Palisades.

The Palisades transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including: the permanent shutdown of Palisades and the transfer of all nuclear fuel from the reactor vessel to the spent nuclear fuel pool; NRC regulatory approval for the transfer of the Palisades and Big Rock Point operating and independent spent fuel storage installation licenses; receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS; the market value of the nuclear decommissioning trust for Palisades, less the hypothetical income tax on the aggregate unrealized gain of such fund assets at closing, equaling or exceeding a specified minimum amount; and, the Pilgrim transaction having closed.

Subject to the above conditions, the Palisades transaction is expected to close by the end of 2022.  As of December 31, 2019, Entergy’s adjusted net investment in Palisades was $60 million.  The primary variables in the ultimate loss or gain that Entergy will incur on the transaction are the values of the nuclear decommissioning trust and the asset retirement obligations at closing, the financial results from plant operations until the closing, and the level of any unrealized deferred tax balances at closing.

Costs Associated with Exit of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities Business

Entergy incurred approximately $91 million in costs in 2019, $139 million in costs in 2018, and $113 million in costs in 2017 associated with management’s strategy to exit the Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant power business, primarily employee retention and severance expenses and other benefits-related costs, and contracted economic development contributions.  Entergy expects to incur employee retention and severance expenses of approximately $75 million in 2020, and a total of approximately $55 million from 2021 through 2022 associated with the exit from the merchant power business.  See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of these costs.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities incurred $100 million in 2019, $532 million in 2018, and $538 million in 2017 of impairment charges related to nuclear fuel spending, nuclear refueling outage spending, expenditures for capital assets, and asset retirement obligation revisions.  These costs were charged to expense as incurred as a result of the impaired value of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants’ long-lived assets due to the significantly reduced remaining estimated operating lives associated with management’s strategy to exit the Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant power business.  Entergy expects to continue to incur costs associated with nuclear fuel-related spending and expenditures for capital assets and, except for Palisades, expects to continue to charge these costs to expense as incurred because Entergy expects the value of the plants to continue to be impaired.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of these impairment charges.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

This section discusses Entergy’s capital structure, capital spending plans and other uses of capital, sources of capital, and the cash flow activity presented in the cash flow statement.

Capital Structure

Entergy’s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table.  The decrease in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to the settlement of equity forwards in 2019, partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt in 2019.  See Note 7 to the financial statements for a discussion of the equity forward sale agreements and Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of long-term debt.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

(a)

Calculation excludes the Arkansas, Louisiana, New Orleans, and Texas securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas, respectively.

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents.  Debt consists of notes payable and commercial paper, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion.  Capital consists of debt, common shareholders’ equity, and subsidiaries’ preferred stock without sinking fund.  Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents.  Entergy uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy’s financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial statements.  Entergy also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

Long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion, makes up most of Entergy’s total debt outstanding.  Following are Entergy’s long-term debt principal maturities and estimated interest payments as of December 31, 2019.  To estimate future interest payments for variable rate debt, Entergy used the rate as of December 31, 2019.  The amounts below include payments on System Energy’s Grand Gulf sale-leaseback transaction, which are included in long-term debt on the balance sheet.

Note 5 to the financial statements provides more detail concerning long-term debt outstanding.

Entergy Corporation has in place a credit facility that has a borrowing capacity of

$3.5 billion

and expires in September 2024.  The facility includes fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against

$20 million

of the total borrowing capacity of the credit facility.  The commitment fee is currently

0.225%

of the undrawn commitment amount.  Commitment fees and interest rates on loans under the credit facility can fluctuate depending on the senior unsecured debt ratings of Entergy Corporation.  The weighted average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was

3.77%

on the drawn portion of the facility.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

As of December 31, 2019, amounts outstanding and capacity available under the $3.5 billion credit facility are:

A covenant in Entergy Corporation’s credit facility requires Entergy to maintain a consolidated debt ratio, as defined, of 65% or less of its total capitalization.  The calculation of this debt ratio under Entergy Corporation’s credit facility is different than the calculation of the debt to capital ratio above.  One such difference is that it excludes the effects, among other things, of certain impairments related to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear generation assets.  Entergy is currently in compliance with the covenant and expects to remain in compliance with this covenant.  If Entergy fails to meet this ratio, or if Entergy or one of the Utility operating companies (except Entergy New Orleans) defaults on other indebtedness or is in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, an acceleration of the Entergy Corporation credit facility’s maturity date may occur.

Entergy Corporation has a commercial paper program with a Board-approved program limit of up to

Operating Lease Obligations and Guarantees of Unconsolidated Obligations

Entergy has a minimal amount of operating lease obligations and guarantees in support of unconsolidated obligations.  Entergy’s guarantees in support of unconsolidated obligations are not likely to have a material effect on Entergy’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  Following are Entergy’s payment obligations as of December 31, 2019 on non-cancelable operating leases with a term over one year:

” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy has

$1,542 million

of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital

Following are the amounts of Entergy’s planned construction and other capital investments by operating segment for 2020 through 2022.

Planned construction and capital investments refer to amounts Entergy plans to spend on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of its service, equipment, or systems and to support normal customer growth.  In addition to routine capital projects, they also refer to amounts Entergy plans to spend on non-routine capital investments for which Entergy is either contractually obligated, has Board approval, or otherwise expects to make to satisfy regulatory or legal requirements.  Amounts include the following types of construction and capital investments:

•

Investments, including the Lake Charles Power Station, Washington Parish Energy Center, Sunflower Solar



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Facility, New Orleans Power Station, Montgomery County Power Station, and Searcy Solar Facility, each discussed below, and potential construction of additional generation.

•

Investments in Entergy’s Utility nuclear fleet.

•

Transmission spending to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable economic growth.

•

Distribution spending to enhance reliability and improve service to customers, including investment to support advanced metering.

•

Entergy Wholesale Commodities investments such as component replacements, software and security, and dry cask storage.

For the next several years, the Utility’s owned generating capacity is projected to be adequate to meet MISO reserve requirements; however, in the longer-term additional supply resources will be needed, and its supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new generation resources.  Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above.  Estimated capital expenditures are also subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of business restructuring, regulatory constraints and requirements, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital.

Lake Charles Power Station

In November 2016, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking certification that the public convenience and necessity would be served by the construction of the Lake Charles Power Station, a nominal 994 megawatt combined-cycle generating unit in Westlake, Louisiana, on land adjacent to the existing Nelson plant in Calcasieu Parish.  The current estimated cost of the Lake Charles Power Station is $872 million, including estimated costs of transmission interconnection and other related costs.  In May 2017 the parties to the proceeding agreed to an uncontested stipulation finding that construction of the Lake Charles Power Station is in the public interest and authorizing an in-service rate recovery plan.  In July 2017 the LPSC issued an order unanimously approving the stipulation and approved certification of the unit.  Construction is in progress and commercial operation is expected to occur by mid-2020.

Washington Parish Energy Center

In April 2017, Entergy Louisiana signed an agreement with a subsidiary of Calpine Corporation for the construction and purchase of a peaking plant.  Calpine will construct the plant, which will consist of two natural gas-fired combustion turbine units with a total nominal capacity of approximately 361 MW.  The plant, named the Washington Parish Energy Center, will be located in Bogalusa, Louisiana.  Subject to regulatory approvals, Entergy Louisiana will purchase the plant once it is complete for an estimated total investment of approximately $261 million, including transmission and other related costs.  In May 2017, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking certification of the plant.  In April 2018 the parties reached a settlement recommending certification and cost recovery through the additional capacity mechanism of the formula rate plan, consistent with prior LPSC precedent with respect to the certification and recovery of plants previously acquired by Entergy Louisiana.  The LPSC issued an order approving the settlement in May 2018.  Construction is in progress and commercial operation is expected to occur by the end of 2020.

Sunflower Solar Facility

In November 2018, Entergy Mississippi announced that it signed an agreement for the purchase of an approximately 100 MW to-be-constructed solar photovoltaic facility that will be sited on approximately 1,000 acres in Sunflower County, Mississippi.  The estimated base purchase price is approximately $138.4 million.  The estimated total investment, including the base purchase price and other related costs, for Entergy Mississippi to acquire the Sunflower Solar Facility is approximately $153.2 million.  The purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including full cost recovery, from applicable federal and state regulatory and permitting

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

agencies.  The project will be built by Sunflower County Solar Project, LLC, a sub-subsidiary of Recurrent Energy, LLC.  Entergy Mississippi will purchase the facility upon mechanical completion and after the other purchase contingencies have been met.  In December 2018, Entergy Mississippi filed a joint petition with Sunflower Solar Project at the MPSC for Sunflower Solar Project to construct and for Entergy Mississippi to acquire and thereafter own, operate, improve, and maintain the solar facility.  Entergy Mississippi proposed revisions to its formula rate plan that would provide for a mechanism, the interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism, in the formula rate plan to recover the non-fuel related costs of additional owned capacity acquired by Entergy Mississippi, including the annual ownership costs of the Sunflower Solar Facility.  In December 2019 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi’s proposed revisions to its formula rate plan to provide for an interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism.  The MPSC must approve recovery through the interim capacity rate adjustment for each new resource.  In August 2019 consultants retained by the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed a report expressing concerns regarding the project economics and recommended that, should the MPSC wish to approve the project, Entergy Mississippi should be required to guarantee the energy output of the unit.  Entergy Mississippi and the Staff are engaged in settlement discussions to address these concerns.  A hearing before the MPSC is targeted to occur by the second quarter of 2020.  Closing is expected to occur by the end of 2021.

New Orleans Power Station

In March 2018 the City Council adopted a resolution approving construction of the New Orleans Power Station, a 128 MW unit composed of natural gas-fired reciprocating engines, and a related cost recovery plan.  The cost estimate for the plant, which will be located at the site of the Michoud generating facility that was retired in May 2016, is $210 million.  Entergy New Orleans had previously filed an application with the City Council seeking a public interest determination and authorization to construct a 226 MW advanced combustion turbine power station.  In January 2017 several intervenors filed testimony opposing the construction of the New Orleans Power Station on various grounds.  In July 2017, Entergy New Orleans submitted a supplemental and amending application to the City Council seeking approval to construct either the originally proposed 226 MW advanced combustion turbine power station, or alternatively, the 128 MW power station.  In addition, the application renewed the commitment to pursue up to 100 MW of renewable resources to serve New Orleans.

In April 2018 intervenors opposing the construction of the New Orleans Power Station filed with the City Council a request for rehearing, which was subsequently denied, and a petition for judicial review of the City Council’s decision, and also filed a lawsuit challenging the City Council’s approval based on Louisiana’s open meeting law.  In May 2018 the City Council announced that it would initiate an investigation into allegations that Entergy New Orleans, Entergy, or some other entity paid or participated in paying certain attendees and speakers in support of the New Orleans Power Station to attend or speak at certain meetings organized by the City Council.  In October 2018 investigators for the City Council released their report, concluding that individuals were paid to attend or speak in support of the New Orleans Power Station and that Entergy New Orleans “knew or should have known that such conduct occurred or reasonably might occur.”  The City Council issued a resolution requiring Entergy New Orleans to show cause why it should not be fined $5 million as a result of the findings in the report.  In November 2018, Entergy New Orleans submitted its response to the show cause resolution, disagreeing with certain characterizations and omissions of fact in the report and asserting that the City Council could not legally impose the proposed fine.  Simultaneous with the filing of its response to the show cause resolution, Entergy New Orleans sent a letter to the City Council re-asserting that the City Council’s imposition of the proposed fine would be unlawful, but acknowledging that the actions of a subcontractor, which was retained by an Entergy New Orleans contractor without the knowledge or contractually-required consent of Entergy New Orleans, were contrary to Entergy’s values.  In that letter, Entergy New Orleans offered to donate $5 million to the City Council to resolve the show cause proceeding.  In January 2019, Entergy New Orleans submitted a new settlement proposal to the City Council.  The proposal retains the components of the first offer but adds to it a commitment to make reasonable efforts to limit the costs of the project to the $210 million cost estimate with advanced notification of anticipated cost overruns, additional reporting requirements for cost and environmental items, and a commitment regarding reliability investment and to work with the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board to provide a reliable source of power.  In February 2019 the City Council approved a resolution approving the settlement proposal and allowing the construction of the New Orleans Power Station to commence.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Also in February 2019 certain intervenors in the City Council proceeding on the New Orleans Power Station filed suit in Louisiana state court challenging the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality’s issuance of the New Orleans Power Station’s air permit.  Entergy New Orleans intervened in that lawsuit and, along with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, filed exceptions seeking dismissal of the lawsuit.  In June 2019 the state court judge sustained the exceptions and dismissed the plaintiffs’ petition with prejudice.

Also in June 2019, a state court judge in New Orleans affirmed the City Council’s approval of the New Orleans Power Station and dismissed the petition for judicial review that had been filed in April 2018.  The petitioners have filed an appeal of that ruling.  Also in June 2019, with regard to the lawsuit challenging the City Council’s decision on the basis of a violation of the open meetings law, the same state court judge in New Orleans ruled that there was a violation of the open meetings law at the February 2018 meeting of the City Council’s Utility Committee at which that Committee considered the New Orleans Power Station approval, and further ruled that, although there was no violation of the open meetings law at the March 2018 full City Council meeting at which the New Orleans Power Station was approved, both the approval of the Utility Committee and the approval of the full City Council were void.  The City Council and Entergy New Orleans each filed a suspensive appeal of the open meetings law ruling.  A suspensive appeal suspends the effect of the judgment in the open meetings law proceeding while the appeal is being taken.  The petitioners sought in the state appellate court, and then at the Louisiana Supreme Court, to terminate the suspension of the effect of the judgment, but both courts declined to do so.  Appellate briefing on the merits both in the open meetings law appeal and in the judicial review appeal occurred in November and December 2019 and oral argument in both cases was heard in January 2020.  In February 2020 the state appellate court reversed the lower court’s ruling that the City Council’s approval of the New Orleans Power Station was void due to a violation of the open meetings law at the City Council’s Utility Committee meeting in February 2018.  The state appellate court ruled that there was no violation of the open meetings law at the full City Council meeting in March 2018 and that the lower court erred in voiding the City Council resolution approving the New Orleans Power Station.  The appellate court’s decision on the appeal of the judicial review decision that affirmed the City Council’s approval of the New Orleans Power Station as in the public interest is still pending.  Construction of the plant is on schedule, with commercial operation expected in mid-2020.

Montgomery County Power Station

In October 2016, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT seeking certification that the public convenience and necessity would be served by the construction of the Montgomery County Power Station, a nominal 993 MW combined-cycle generating unit in Willis, Texas, on land adjacent to the existing Lewis Creek plant.  The current estimated cost of the Montgomery County Power Station is $937 million, including approximately $111 million of transmission interconnection and network upgrades and other related costs.  The independent monitor, who oversaw the request for proposal process, filed testimony and a report affirming that the Montgomery County Power Station was selected through an objective and fair request for proposal process that showed no undue preference to any proposal.  In June 2017 parties to the proceeding filed an unopposed stipulation and settlement agreement.  The stipulation contemplates that Entergy Texas’s level of cost-recovery for generation construction costs for Montgomery County Power Station is capped at $831 million, subject to certain exclusions such as force majeure events.  Transmission interconnection and network upgrades and other related costs are not subject to the $831 million cap.  In July 2017 the PUCT approved the stipulation.  Subject to the timely receipt of other permits and approvals, commercial operation is estimated to occur by mid-2021.

Searcy Solar Facility

In March 2019, Entergy Arkansas announced that it signed an agreement for the purchase of an approximately 100 MW to-be-constructed solar energy facility that will be sited on approximately 800 acres in White County near Searcy, Arkansas.  The purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals from applicable federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies.  The project will be constructed by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources.  Entergy Arkansas will purchase the facility upon mechanical completion and after the other purchase contingencies have been met.  Closing is expected to occur by the end of 2021.  In May 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

a petition with the APSC seeking a finding that the transaction is in the public interest and requesting all necessary approvals.  In September 2019 other parties filed testimony largely supporting the resource acquisition but disputing Entergy Arkansas’s proposed method of cost recovery.  Entergy Arkansas filed its rebuttal testimony in October 2019.  In February 2020, Entergy Arkansas, the Attorney General, and the APSC general staff filed a partial settlement agreement asking the APSC to approve, based on the record in the proceeding, all issues except certain issues that are submitted to the APSC for determination.

Dividends and Stock Repurchases

Declarations of dividends on Entergy’s common stock are made at the discretion of the Board.  Among other things, the Board evaluates the level of Entergy’s common stock dividends based upon earnings per share from the Utility operating segment and the Parent and Other portion of the business, financial strength, and future investment opportunities.  At its January 2020 meeting, the Board declared a dividend of $0.93 per share. Entergy paid $712 million in


, $648 million in


, and $629 million in


in cash dividends on its common stock.

In accordance with Entergy’s stock-based compensation plans, Entergy periodically grants stock options, restricted stock, performance units, and restricted stock unit awards to key employees, which may be exercised to obtain shares of Entergy’s common stock.  According to the plans, these shares can be newly issued shares, treasury stock, or shares purchased on the open market.  Entergy’s management has been authorized by the Board to repurchase on the open market shares up to an amount sufficient to fund the exercise of grants under the plans.

In addition to the authority to fund grant exercises, the Board has authorized share repurchase programs to enable opportunistic purchases in response to market conditions.  In October 2010 the Board granted authority for a $500 million share repurchase program.  As of December 31,


, $350 million of authority remains under the $500 million share repurchase program.  The amount of repurchases may vary as a result of material changes in business results or capital spending or new investment opportunities, or if limitations in the credit markets continue for a prolonged period.

Sources of Capital

Entergy’s sources to meet its capital requirements and to fund potential investments include:

•

internally generated funds;

•

cash on hand ($426 million as of December 31, 2019);

•

debt and equity issuances in the capital markets;

•

bank financing under new or existing facilities or commercial paper; and

•

sales of assets.

Circumstances such as weather patterns, fuel and purchased power price fluctuations, and unanticipated expenses, including unscheduled plant outages and storms, could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds in the future.  Entergy Corporation expects to finance up to 10% of the amount of the Utility’s capital expenditure plans through equity issuances in the capital markets.

Provisions within the organizational documents relating to preferred stock or membership interests of certain of Entergy Corporation’s subsidiaries could restrict the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on their common and preferred equity.  All debt and preferred equity issuances by the Registrant Subsidiaries require prior regulatory approval and their debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in bond indentures and other agreements.  Entergy believes that the Registrant Subsidiaries have sufficient capacity under these tests to meet foreseeable capital needs.

The FERC has jurisdiction over securities issuances by the Utility operating companies and System Energy.  The City Council has concurrent jurisdiction over Entergy New Orleans’s securities issuances with maturities longer

than one year.  The APSC has concurrent jurisdiction over Entergy Arkansas’s issuances of securities secured by Arkansas property, including first mortgage bond issuances.  No regulatory approvals are necessary for Entergy Corporation to issue securities.  The current FERC-authorized short-term borrowing limits and long-term borrowing limits for Entergy New Orleans are effective through October 2021.  The current FERC-authorized short-term borrowing limits and long-term financing authorization for Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Texas, and System Energy are effective through November 2020.  Entergy Arkansas has obtained first mortgage bond/secured financing authorization from the APSC that extends through December 2020.  Entergy New Orleans also has obtained long-term financing authorization from the City Council that extends through October 2021.  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy each have obtained long-term financing authorization from the FERC that extends through November 2020 for issuances by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entities.  In addition to borrowings from commercial banks, the Registrant Subsidiaries may also borrow from the Entergy System money pool and from other internal short-term borrowing arrangements.  The money pool and the other internal borrowing arrangements are inter-company borrowing arrangements designed to reduce Entergy’s subsidiaries’ dependence on external short-term borrowings.  Borrowings from internal and external short-term borrowings combined may not exceed the FERC-authorized limits.  See Notes 4 and 5 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy’s borrowing limits, authorizations, and amounts outstanding.

Cash Flow Activity

As shown in Entergy’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash flows for the years ended December 31,


,


, and


were as follows:

2019 Compared to 2018

Operating Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by $432 million in 2019 primarily due to:

•

the decrease in the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to Utility customers.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act;

•

an increase due to the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs in 2019 as compared to the prior year.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of fuel and purchased power cost recovery;

•

an increase of $109 million due to Vermont Yankee decommissioning spending in 2018, partially offset by Pilgrim decommissioning spending in 2019; and

•

a decrease of $87 million in spending on nuclear refueling outages in 2019 as compared to the prior year.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

The increase was partially offset by:

•

an increase of $98 million in severance and retention payments in 2019 as compared to prior year.  See “

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -

Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business

” above for a discussion of management’s strategy to exit the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ merchant power business; and

•

lower Entergy Wholesale Commodities revenues in 2019.

Investing Activities

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased by $404 million in 2019 primarily due to:

•

an increase of $334 million in construction expenditures in the Utility business, as discussed below;

•

the purchase of the Choctaw Generating Station in October 2019 for approximately $305 million.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of the Choctaw Generating Station purchase; and

•

a decrease of $57 million in proceeds received from the DOE in 2019 as compared to the prior year resulting from litigation regarding spent nuclear fuel storage costs that were previously capitalized.  See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation.

The increase was partially offset by:

•

a decrease of $174 million in nuclear fuel purchases due to variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle; and

•

a decrease of $85 million primarily due to changes in collateral posted to provide credit support to secure its obligations under agreements to sell power produced by Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ power plants.

The increase in construction expenditures in the Utility business is primarily due to:

•

an increase of $211 million in transmission construction expenditures due to a higher scope of work performed in 2019 on various projects;

•

an increase of $188 million primarily due to investment in the infrastructure of the distribution system, including increased spending on advanced metering infrastructure; and

•

an increase of $91 million in storm spending in 2019.

The increase in construction expenditures in the Utility business was partially offset by:

•

a decrease of $62 million in fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures primarily due to lower spending in 2019 on self-build projects in the Utility business and a lower scope of work performed in 2019 on various projects;

•

a decrease of $39 million in nuclear construction expenditures primarily due to lower spending in 2019 on various nuclear projects; and

•

a decrease of $33 million in information technology capital expenditures primarily due to lower spending in 2019 on critical infrastructure protection.

Financing Activities

Net cash flow provided by financing activities increased by $217 million in 2019 primarily due to:

•

long-term debt activity providing approximately $1,685 million of cash in 2019 compared to providing approximately $1,070 million in 2018;



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

•

net repayments of short-term borrowings of $111 million in 2018 by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entities; and

•

an increase of $108 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock as a result of the settlement of equity forwards in 2019 and 2018.  See Note 7 to the financial statements for discussion of the equity forward sale agreements.

The increase was partially offset by:

•

a decrease of $471 million in net issuances of commercial paper in 2019 compared to 2018;

•

an increase of $64 million in common stock dividends paid as a result of an increase in the shares outstanding and an increase in the dividend paid in 2019 compared to 2018; and

•

the issuance of $35 million aggregate liquidation value 5.375% Series A preferred stock in 2019 by Entergy Texas compared to the issuance of $73 million aggregate liquidation value 6.75% Series C preferred membership interests in 2018 by Entergy Utility Holding Company.

Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery

The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge for their services significantly influence Entergy’s financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.  These companies are regulated and the rates charged to their customers are determined in regulatory proceedings.  Governmental agencies, including the APSC, the LPSC, the MPSC, the City Council, the PUCT, and the FERC, are primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.  Following is a summary of the Utility operating companies’ authorized returns on common equity:

The Utility operating companies’ base rate, fuel and purchased power cost recovery, and storm cost recovery proceedings are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Federal Regulation

The FERC regulates wholesale sales of electricity rates and interstate transmission of electricity, including rates for System Energy’s sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  The current return on equity and capital structure of System Energy are currently the subject of complaints filed by certain of the operating companies’ retail regulators.  The current return on equity under the Unit Power Sales Agreement is 10.94%.  Prior to each operating company’s termination of participation in the System Agreement (Entergy Arkansas in December 2013, Entergy Mississippi in November 2015, and Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas each in August 2016), the Utility operating companies engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which was a rate schedule approved by the FERC.  Certain of the Utility operating companies’ retail regulators are pursuing litigation involving the System Agreement at the FERC and in federal courts.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the System Agreement proceedings, the complaints filed with the FERC challenging System Energy’s return on equity, and the amendments to the Unit Power Sales Agreement approved by the FERC in 2018.

Market and Credit Risk Sensitive Instruments

Market risk is the risk of changes in the value of commodity and financial instruments, or in future net income or cash flows, in response to changing market conditions.  Entergy holds commodity and financial instruments that are exposed to the following significant market risks.

•

The commodity price risk associated with the sale of electricity by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business.

•

The interest rate and equity price risk associated with Entergy’s investments in pension and other postretirement benefit trust funds.  See Note 11 to the financial statements for details regarding Entergy’s pension and other postretirement benefit trust funds.

•

The interest rate and equity price risk associated with Entergy’s investments in nuclear plant decommissioning trust funds, particularly in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business.  See Note 16 to the financial statements for details regarding Entergy’s decommissioning trust funds.

•

The interest rate risk associated with changes in interest rates as a result of Entergy’s outstanding indebtedness.  Entergy manages its interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates and its debt outstanding in relation to total capitalization.  See Notes 4 and 5 to the financial statements for the details of Entergy’s debt outstanding.

The Utility has limited exposure to the effects of market risk because it operates primarily under cost-based rate regulation.  To the extent approved by their retail regulators, the Utility operating companies use commodity and financial instruments to hedge the exposure to price volatility inherent in their purchased power, fuel, and gas purchased for resale costs that are recovered from customers.

Entergy’s commodity and financial instruments are also exposed to credit risk.  Credit risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by suppliers, customers, or financial counterparties to a contract or agreement.  Entergy is also exposed to a potential demand on liquidity due to credit support requirements within its supply or sales agreements.

Commodity Price Risk

Power Generation

As a wholesale generator, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ core business is selling energy, measured in MWh, to its customers.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities enters into forward contracts with its customers and also sells energy in the day ahead or spot markets.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities also sells unforced capacity, which allows load-serving entities to meet specified reserve and related requirements placed on them by the ISOs in their respective areas.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ forward physical power contracts consist of contracts to sell energy only, contracts to sell capacity only, and bundled contracts in which it sells both capacity and energy.  While the terminology and payment mechanics vary in these contracts, each of these types of contracts requires Entergy Wholesale Commodities to deliver MWh of energy, make capacity available, or both.

In addition to its forward physical power



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

contracts, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may also use a combination of financial contracts, including swaps, collars, and options, to manage forward commodity price risk.  The sensitivities may not reflect the total maximum upside potential from higher market prices.  The information contained in the following table represents projections at a point in time and will vary over time based on numerous factors, such as future market prices, contracting activities, and generation.  Following is a summary of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ current forward capacity and generation contracts as well as total revenue projections based on market prices as of December 31, 2019.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities Nuclear Portfolio

(a)

Percent of planned generation output sold or purchased forward under contracts, forward physical contracts, forward financial contracts, or options that mitigate price uncertainty.  Positions that are not classified as hedges are netted in the planned generation under contract.

(b)

Transaction under which power is supplied from a specific generation asset; if the asset is not operating, the seller is generally not liable to the buyer for any damages.  Certain unit-contingent sales include a guarantee of availability.  Availability guarantees provide for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the seller fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold.  All of Entergy’s outstanding guarantees of availability provide for dollar limits on Entergy’s maximum liability under such guarantees.

(c)

Amount of output expected to be generated by Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear resources considering plant operating characteristics and outage schedules.

(d)

Assumes the planned shutdown of Indian Point 2 on April 30, 2020, planned shutdown of Indian Point 3 on April 30, 2021, and planned shutdown of Palisades on May 31, 2022.  For a discussion regarding the planned shutdown of the Indian Point 2, Indian Point 3, and Palisades plants, see “

Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business

” above.

(e)

Percent of planned qualified capacity sold to mitigate price uncertainty under physical or financial transactions.

(f)

A contract for the sale of installed capacity and related energy, priced per megawatt-hour sold.

(g)

A contract for the sale of an installed capacity product in a regional market.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

(h)

Includes assumptions on converting a portion of the portfolio to contracted with fixed price and excludes non-cash revenue from the amortization of the Palisades below-market purchased power agreement, mark-to-market activity, and service revenues.

Entergy estimates that a positive $10 per MWh change in the annual average energy price in the markets in which the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear business sells power, based on the respective year-end market conditions, planned generation volumes, and hedged positions, would have a corresponding effect on pre-tax income of

$4 million

in 2020 and would have had a corresponding effect on pre-tax income of

$6 million

in 2019.  A negative $10 per MWh change in the annual average energy price in the markets based on the respective year-end market conditions, planned generation volumes, and hedged positions, would have a corresponding effect on pre-tax income of

($4) million

in 2020 and would have had a corresponding effect on pre-tax income of

($6) million

in 2019.

Some of the agreements to sell the power produced by Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ power plants contain provisions that require an Entergy subsidiary to provide credit support to secure its obligations under the agreements.  The Entergy subsidiary is required to provide credit support based upon the difference between the current market prices and contracted power prices in the regions where Entergy Wholesale Commodities sells power.  The primary form of credit support to satisfy these requirements is an Entergy Corporation guarantee.  Cash and letters of credit are also acceptable forms of credit support.  At December 31, 2019, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had liquidity exposure of

$78 million

under the guarantees in place supporting Entergy Wholesale Commodities transactions and

$19 million

of posted cash collateral.  In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation’s credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2019, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately

$30 million

of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements.  As of December 31, 2019, the liquidity exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale Commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously posted collateral from counterparties, would increase by

$90 million

for a $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets.

As of December 31, 2019, substantially all of the credit exposure associated with the planned energy output under contract for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants through 2022 is with counterparties or their guarantors that have public investment grade credit ratings.

Nuclear Matters

Entergy’s Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses include the ownership and operation of nuclear generating plants and are, therefore, subject to the risks related to such ownership and operation.  These include risks related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements, both for capital investments and operational needs, to position Entergy’s nuclear fleet to meet its operational goals, including the financial requirements to address emerging issues like stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the plant systems and the Fukushima event; the implementation of plans to exit the Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant power business by 2022 and the post-shutdown decommissioning of these plants; regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license renewal and amendments, and decommissioning; the performance and capacity factors of these nuclear plants; the availability of interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets and earnings to complete decommissioning of each site when required; and limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events such as a nuclear accident.

NRC Reactor Oversight Process

The NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process is a program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response.  The NRC evaluates plant performance by analyzing two distinct inputs: inspection findings resulting from the NRC’s inspection program



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

and performance indicators reported by the licensee.  The evaluations result in the placement of each plant in one of the NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix columns: “licensee response column,” or Column 1, “regulatory response column,” or Column 2, “degraded cornerstone column,” or Column 3, and “multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column,” or Column 4.  Plants in Column 1 are subject to normal NRC inspection activities.  Plants in Column 2, Column 3, or Column 4 are subject to progressively increasing levels of inspection by the NRC with, in general, progressively increasing levels of associated costs.  Nuclear generating plants owned and operated by Entergy’s Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses are currently in Column 1.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of Entergy’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in these assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

Entergy subsidiaries own nuclear generation facilities in both the Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities operating segments.  Regulations require Entergy subsidiaries to decommission the nuclear power plants after each facility is taken out of service, and cash is deposited in trust funds during the facilities’ operating lives in order to provide for this obligation.  Entergy conducts periodic decommissioning cost studies to estimate the costs that will be incurred to decommission the facilities.  The following key assumptions have a significant effect on these estimates.

•

Timing

- In projecting decommissioning costs, two assumptions must be made to estimate the timing of plant decommissioning.  First, the date of the plant’s retirement must be estimated for those plants that do not have an announced shutdown date.  The estimate may include assumptions regarding the possibility that the plant may have an operating life shorter than the operating license expiration.  Second, an assumption must be made regarding whether all decommissioning activity will proceed immediately upon plant retirement, or whether the plant will be placed in SAFSTOR status.  SAFSTOR is decommissioning a facility by placing it in a safe, stable condition that is maintained until it is subsequently decontaminated and dismantled to levels that permit license termination, normally within 60 years from permanent cessation of operations.  A change of assumption regarding either the period of continued operation, the use of a SAFSTOR period, or whether Entergy will continue to hold the plant or the plant is held for sale can change the present value of the asset retirement obligation.

•

Cost Escalation Factors

- Entergy’s current decommissioning cost studies include an assumption that decommissioning costs will escalate over present cost levels by factors ranging from approximately

2%

to

3%

annually.  A 50-basis point change in this assumption could change the estimated present value of the decommissioning liabilities by approximately

6%

to

18%

.  The timing assumption influences the significance of the effect of a change in the estimated inflation or cost escalation rate because the effect increases with the length of time assumed before decommissioning activity ends.

•

Spent Fuel Disposal

- Federal law requires the DOE to provide for the permanent storage of spent nuclear fuel, and legislation has been passed by Congress to develop a repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  The DOE has not yet begun accepting spent nuclear fuel and is in non-compliance with federal law.  The DOE continues to delay meeting its obligation and Entergy’s nuclear plant owners are continuing to pursue damage claims against the DOE for its failure to provide timely spent fuel storage.  Until a federal site is available, however, nuclear plant operators must provide for interim spent fuel storage on the nuclear plant site, which can require the construction and maintenance of dry cask storage sites or other facilities.  The costs of developing and maintaining these facilities during the decommissioning period can have a significant effect (as much as an average of 20% to 30% of total estimated decommissioning costs).  Entergy’s decommissioning studies include



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

cost estimates for spent fuel storage.  These estimates could change in the future, however, based on the expected timing of when the DOE begins to fulfill its obligation to receive and store spent nuclear fuel.  See Note 8 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy’s spent nuclear fuel litigation.

•

Technology and Regulation

- Over the past several years, more practical experience with the actual decommissioning of nuclear facilities has been gained and that experience has been incorporated into Entergy’s current decommissioning cost estimates.  Given the long duration of decommissioning projects, additional experience, including technological advancements in decommissioning, could be gained and affect current cost estimates.  In addition, if regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning were to change, this could affect cost estimates.

•

Interest Rates

- The estimated decommissioning costs that are the basis for the recorded decommissioning liability are discounted to present value using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. When the decommissioning liability is revised, increases in cash flows are discounted using the current credit-adjusted risk-free rate.  Decreases in estimated cash flows are discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate used previously in estimating the decommissioning liability that is being revised.  Therefore, to the extent that a revised cost study results in an increase in estimated cash flows, a change in interest rates from the time of the previous cost estimate will affect the calculation of the present value of the revised decommissioning liability.

Revisions of estimated decommissioning costs that decrease the liability also result in a decrease in the asset retirement cost asset.  For the non-rate-regulated portions of Entergy’s business for which the plant’s value is impaired, these reductions will immediately reduce operating expenses in the period of the revision if the reduction of the liability exceeds the amount of the undepreciated plant asset at the date of the revision.  Revisions of estimated decommissioning costs that increase the liability result in an increase in the asset retirement cost asset, which is then depreciated over the asset’s remaining economic life.  For a plant in the non-rate-regulated portions of Entergy’s business for which the plant’s value is impaired, however, including a plant that is shutdown, or is nearing its shutdown date, the increase in the liability is likely to immediately increase operating expense in the period of the revision and not increase the asset retirement cost asset.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of impairment of long-lived assets and Note 9 to the financial statements for further discussion of asset retirement obligations.

Utility Regulatory Accounting

Entergy’s Utility operating companies and System Energy are subject to retail regulation by their respective state and local regulators and to wholesale regulation by the FERC.  Because these regulatory agencies set the rates the Utility operating companies and System Energy are allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable return on equity, the Utility operating companies and System Energy apply accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities.  Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery from customers through regulated rates.  Regulatory liabilities represent the excess recovery of costs that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of rate and regulatory matters, including details of Entergy’s and the Registrant Subsidiaries’ regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities.

For each regulatory jurisdiction in which they conduct business, the Utility operating companies and System Energy assess whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur.  This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments.  If the assessments made by the Utility operating companies and System Energy are ultimately different than actual regulatory outcomes, it could materially affect the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of Entergy or the Registrant Subsidiaries.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Trust Fund Investments

Entergy has significant investments in long-lived assets in both of its operating segments, and Entergy evaluates



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

these assets against the market economics and under the accounting rules for impairment when there are indications that an impairment may exist.  This evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and uncertainty.  In the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, Entergy’s investments in merchant generation assets are subject to impairment if adverse market or regulatory conditions arise, particularly if it leads to a decision or an expectation that Entergy will operate or own a plant for a shorter period than previously expected; if there is a significant adverse change in the physical condition of a plant; or, if capital investment in a plant significantly exceeds previously-expected amounts.

If an asset is considered held for use, and Entergy concludes that events and circumstances are present indicating that an impairment analysis should be performed under the accounting standards, the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the asset are compared to the asset’s carrying value.  The carrying value of the asset includes any capitalized asset retirement cost associated with the decommissioning liability; therefore, changes in assumptions that affect the decommissioning liability can increase or decrease the carrying value of the asset subject to impairment.  If the expected undiscounted future cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is recorded.  If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value and the carrying value exceeds the fair value, Entergy is required to record an impairment charge to write the asset down to its fair value.  If an asset is considered held for sale, an impairment is required to be recognized if the fair value (less costs to sell) of the asset is less than its carrying value.

The expected future cash flows are based on a number of key assumptions, including:

•

Future power and fuel prices

- Electricity and gas prices can be very volatile.  This volatility increases the imprecision inherent in the long-term forecasts of commodity prices that are a key determinant of estimated future cash flows.

•

Market value of generation assets

- Valuing assets held for sale requires estimating the current market value of generation assets.  While market transactions provide evidence for this valuation, these transactions are relatively infrequent, the market for such assets is volatile, and the value of individual assets is affected by factors unique to those assets.

•

Future operating costs

- Entergy assumes relatively minor annual increases in operating costs.  Technological or regulatory changes that have a significant effect on operations could cause a significant change in these assumptions.

•

Timing and the life of the asset

- Entergy assumes an expected life of the asset.  A change in the timing assumption, whether due to management decisions regarding operation of the plant, the regulatory process, or operational or other factors, could have a significant effect on the expected future cash flows and result in a significant effect on operations.

See Note 14 to the financial statements for a discussion of impairment conclusions related to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants.

Entergy evaluates the available-for-sale debt securities in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear decommissioning trust funds with unrealized losses at the end of each period to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred.  The assessment of whether an investment in a debt security has suffered an other-than-temporary impairment is based on whether Entergy has the intent to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized costs.  Further, if Entergy does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security, an other-than-temporary-impairment is considered to have occurred and it is measured by the present value of cash flows expected to be collected less the amortized cost basis (credit loss).  Entergy’s trusts are managed by third parties who operate in accordance with agreements that define investment guidelines and place restrictions on the purchases and sales of investments.  Effective January 1, 2018 with the adoption of ASU 2016-01, unrealized losses and gains on investments in equity securities held by Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear decommissioning trust funds are recorded in earnings as they occur.  See Note 16 to the financial statements for details on the decommissioning trust funds.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Taxation and Uncertain Tax Positions

Management exercises significant judgment in evaluating the potential tax effects of Entergy’s operations, transactions, and other events.  Entergy accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a recognition model under a two-step approach with a more likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  Management evaluates each tax position based on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.  Significant judgment is required to determine whether available information supports the assertion that the recognition threshold has been met.  Additionally, measurement of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements is based on the probability of different potential outcomes.  Income tax expense and tax positions recorded could be significantly affected by events such as additional transactions contemplated or consummated by Entergy as well as audits by taxing authorities of the tax positions taken in transactions.  Management believes that the financial statement tax balances are accounted for and adjusted appropriately each quarter as necessary in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance; however, the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable effects on the consolidated financial statements.   Entergy’s income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits, open audits, and other significant tax matters are discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy sponsors qualified, defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees, including cash balance plans and final average pay plans.  Additionally, Entergy currently provides other postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all full-time employees whose most recent date of hire or rehire is before July 1, 2014 and who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy.

Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are affected by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.  Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate for the Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities segments.

Assumptions

Key actuarial assumptions utilized in determining qualified pension and other postretirement health care and life insurance costs include discount rates, projected healthcare cost rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of increase in future compensation levels, retirement rates, expected timing and form of payments, and mortality rates.

Annually, Entergy reviews and, when necessary, adjusts the assumptions for the pension and other postretirement plans.  Every three-to-five years, a formal actuarial assumption experience study that compares assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement health care and life insurance plans is conducted.  The interest rate environment over the past few years and volatility in the financial equity markets have affected Entergy’s funding and reported costs for these benefits.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Discount rates

In selecting an assumed discount rate to calculate benefit obligations, Entergy uses a yield curve based on high-quality corporate debt with cash flows matching the expected plan benefit payments. In estimating the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, Entergy discounts the expected cash flows by the applicable spot rates.

Projected health care cost trend rates

Entergy’s health care cost trend is affected by both medical cost inflation, and with respect to capped costs under the plan, the effects of general inflation.  Entergy reviews actual recent cost trends and projected future trends in establishing its health care cost trend rates.

Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets

In determining its expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in the calculation of benefit plan costs, Entergy reviews past performance, current and expected future asset allocations, and capital market assumptions of its investment consultant and some of its investment managers.  Entergy conducts periodic asset/liability studies in order to set its target asset allocations.

In 2017, Entergy confirmed its liability-driven investment strategy for its pension assets, which recommended that the target asset allocation adjust dynamically over time, based on the funded status of the plan, to an ultimate allocation of 35% equity securities and 65% fixed income securities.  The ultimate asset allocation is expected to be attained when the plan is 100% funded.  The target pension asset allocation for 2019 was 58% equity and 42% fixed income securities.

In 2017, Entergy implemented a new asset allocation strategy for its non-taxable and taxable other postretirement assets, based on the funded status of each sub-account within each trust.  The new strategy no longer focuses on targeting an overall asset allocation for each trust, but rather a target asset allocation for each sub-account within each trust that adjusts dynamically based on the funded status.  The 2019 weighted average target postretirement asset allocation is 45% equity and 55% fixed income securities.  See Note 11 to the financial statements for discussion of the current asset allocations for Entergy’s pension and other postretirement assets.

Costs and Sensitivities

The estimated 2020 and actual 2019 qualified pension and other postretirement costs and related underlying assumptions and sensitivities are shown below:

(a)

In 2019, qualified pension cost included settlement charges of $23.5 million.

Actual asset returns have an effect on Entergy’s qualified pension and other postretirement costs.   In 2019, Entergy’s actual average annual return on qualified pension assets was approximately 21% and for other postretirement assets was approximately 17%, as compared with the 2019 expected long-term rates of return discussed above.

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in millions):

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.

Accounting Mechanisms

In accordance with pension accounting standards, Entergy utilizes a number of accounting mechanisms that reduce the volatility of reported pension costs.  Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred and are amortized into expense only when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets.  If necessary, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.  Additionally, accounting standards allow for the deferral of prior service costs/credits arising from plan amendments that attribute an increase or decrease in benefits to employee service in prior periods.  Prior service costs/credits are then amortized into expense over the average future working life of active employees.  Certain decisions, including workforce reductions, plan amendments, and plant shutdowns may significantly reduce the expense amortization period and result in immediate recognition of certain previously-deferred costs and gains/losses in the form of curtailment gains or losses.  Similarly, payments made to settle benefit obligations, including lump sum benefit payments, can also result in accelerated recognition in the form of settlement losses or gains.

Entergy calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the long-term expected rate of return on assets by the market-related value (MRV) of plan assets.  In general, Entergy determines the MRV of its pension plan assets by calculating a value that uses a 20-quarter phase-in of the difference between actual and expected returns and for its other postretirement benefit plan assets Entergy uses fair value.

Accounting standards require an employer to recognize in its balance sheet the funded status of its benefit plans.  See Note 11 to the financial statements for a further discussion of Entergy’s funded status.

Employer Contributions

Entergy contributed $399.4 million to its qualified pension plans in 2019.  Entergy estimates pension contributions will be approximately $216.3 million in 2020; although the 2020 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2020 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2020.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Minimum required funding calculations as determined under Pension Protection Act guidance are performed annually as of January 1 of each year and are based on measurements of the assets and funding liabilities as measured at that date.  Any excess of the funding liability over the calculated fair market value of assets results in a funding shortfall that, under the Pension Protection Act, must be funded over a seven-year rolling period.  The Pension Protection Act also imposes certain plan limitations if the funded percentage, which is based on calculated fair market values of assets divided by funding liabilities, does not meet certain thresholds.  For funding purposes, asset gains and losses are smoothed in to the calculated fair market value of assets.  The funding liability is based upon a weighted average 24-month corporate bond rate published by the U.S. Treasury which is generally subject to a corridor of the 25-year average of prior segment rates.  Periodic changes in asset returns and interest rates can affect funding shortfalls and future cash contributions.

Entergy contributed $46.6 million to its postretirement plans in 2019 and plans to contribute $49.1 million in 2020.

Other Contingencies

As a company with multi-state utility operations, Entergy is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations and other factors and conditions in the areas in which it operates, which potentially subjects it to environmental, litigation, and other risks.  Entergy periodically evaluates its exposure for such risks and records a provision for those matters which are considered probable and estimable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Environmental

Entergy must comply with environmental laws and regulations applicable to air emissions, water discharges, solid waste (including coal combustion residuals), hazardous waste, toxic substances, protected species, and other environmental matters.  Under these various laws and regulations, Entergy could incur substantial costs to comply or address any impacts to the environment.  Entergy conducts studies to determine the extent of any required remediation and has recorded liabilities based upon its evaluation of the likelihood of loss and expected dollar amount for each issue.  Additional sites or issues could be identified which require environmental remediation or corrective action for which Entergy could be liable.  The amounts of environmental liabilities recorded can be significantly affected by the following external events or conditions.

•

Changes to existing federal, state, or local regulation by governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters.

•

The identification of additional impacts, sites, issues, or the filing of other complaints in which Entergy may be asserted to be a potentially responsible party.

•

The resolution or progression of existing matters through the court system or resolution by the EPA or relevant state or local authority.

Litigation

Entergy is regularly named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits involving employment, customers, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters.  Entergy periodically reviews the cases in which it has been named as defendant and assesses the likelihood of loss in each case as probable, reasonably possible, or remote and records liabilities for cases that have a probable likelihood of loss and the loss can be estimated.  Given the environment in which Entergy operates, and the unpredictable nature of many of the cases in which Entergy is named as a defendant, the ultimate outcome of the litigation to which Entergy is exposed has the potential to materially affect the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of Entergy or the Registrant Subsidiaries.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

Management of Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries has prepared and is responsible for the financial statements and related financial information included in this document.  To meet this responsibility, management establishes and maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  This system includes communication through written policies and procedures, an employee Code of Entegrity, and an organizational structure that provides for appropriate division of responsibility and training of personnel.  This system is also tested by a comprehensive internal audit program.

Entergy management assesses the design and effectiveness of Entergy’s internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis.  In making this assessment, management uses the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework.  The 2013 COSO Framework was utilized for management’s assessment.  Management acknowledges, however, that all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Entergy Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Entergy Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

.

In addition, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of independent Directors, meets with the independent auditors, internal auditors, management, and internal accountants periodically to discuss internal controls, and auditing and financial reporting matters.  The Audit Committee appoints the independent auditors annually, seeks shareholder ratification of the appointment, and reviews with the independent auditors the scope and results of the audit effort.  The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor without management present, providing free access to the Audit Committee.

Based on management’s assessment of internal controls using the 2013 COSO criteria, management believes that Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

.  Management further believes that this assessment, combined with the policies and procedures noted above, provides reasonable assurance that Entergy’s and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries’ financial statements are fairly and accurately presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.





REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements-Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries-Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Corporation is subject to rate regulation by the Arkansas Public Service Commission, Louisiana Public Service Commission, Mississippi Public Service Commission, City Council of New Orleans, Louisiana, and Public Utility



Commission of Texas (the “Commissions”), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric companies in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and the City of New Orleans, and to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; income taxes; operating revenues; operation and maintenance expense; and depreciation expense.

The Corporation’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Because the Commissions and the FERC set the rates, the Corporation is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable return on equity, and the Corporation applies accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. The Corporation assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. While the Corporation has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.

We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of all or a portion of the cost of plant under construction, and (3) a refund to customers. Auditing management’s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions and the FERC involved especially subjective judgment and specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate-setting process.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions and the FERC included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets; and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.

•

We evaluated the Corporation’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

•

We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions and the FERC for the Corporation and other public utilities, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedence of the Commissions’ and the FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.

•

For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Corporation’s filings with the Commissions and the FERC, including the annual formula rate plan filings, base rate case filings, and open complaints filed with the FERC, and considered the filings with the Commissions and the FERC by intervenors that may impact the Corporation’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.

•

We obtained an analysis from management and letters from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities



not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.

Uncertain Tax Positions-Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries-Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Corporation accounts for uncertain income tax positions under a two-step approach with a more likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement. The Corporation has uncertain tax positions related to internal restructuring transactions, which require management to make significant judgments and assumptions related to the technical merits and facts and circumstances of each position, as well as the probability of different potential outcomes. Uncertain tax positions could be significantly affected by events such as additional transactions contemplated or consummated by the Corporation as well as audits by taxing authorities of the tax positions. The net unrecognized tax benefit of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019, includes uncertain tax positions related to internal restructuring transactions.

Given the subjectivity of estimating the uncertain tax positions related to the technical merits applied to internal restructuring transactions, auditing the uncertain tax positions on the internal restructuring transactions involved especially subjective judgment.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the uncertain tax positions on internal restructuring transactions included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls related to uncertain tax positions on internal restructuring transactions, including those over the recognition and measurement of the income tax benefits.

•

We evaluated the Corporation’s disclosures, and the balances recorded, related to uncertain tax positions on internal restructuring transactions.

•

We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the uncertain tax positions on internal restructuring transactions by testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the uncertain tax position on internal restructuring transactions.

•

With the assistance of our income tax specialists, we assessed the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions on internal restructuring transactions and management’s key estimates and judgments made by:

◦

Assessing the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions by comparing to similar cases filed with the Internal Revenue Service

◦

Evaluating the reasonableness and consistency of the probabilities applied to the uncertain tax position on internal restructuring transactions by comparing to probabilities used on similar internal restructuring transaction uncertain tax positions

◦

Considering the impact of changes or settlements in the tax environment on management’s methods and assumptions used to estimate the uncertain tax positions on internal restructuring transactions.

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs-Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries-Refer to Note 9 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Corporation owns nuclear generation facilities in both the Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities operating segments where regulation requires the Corporation to decommission its nuclear power plants after each facility is taken out of service. The Corporation periodically conducts decommissioning cost studies, which requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions, specifically related to future dismantlement cost, site restoration, spent fuel management, and license termination. The liability for nuclear decommissioning was $6.2 billion at December 31, 2019.



Auditing management’s judgments regarding the costs for nuclear decommissioning, including estimates for future dismantlement, site restoration, spent fuel management, and license termination, involved especially subjective judgment in evaluating the appropriateness of the estimates and assumptions.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the underlying costs for nuclear decommissioning included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over nuclear decommissioning, including those over the future dismantlement cost, site restoration, spent fuel management, and license termination.

•

We evaluated the Corporation’s disclosures related to the nuclear decommissioning cost estimates, including the balances recorded and changes in assumptions.

•

We evaluated management’s ability to accurately estimate the costs for nuclear decommissioning by comparing the cost estimates to actual settlements of similar asset retirement obligations at the Corporation.

•

We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the cost of nuclear decommissioning by:

◦

Testing the reasonableness of the underlying data that served as the basis for the estimate

◦

Comparing to management’s prior-year assumptions and testing significant changes in judgments or assumptions

◦

Comparing changes in cost estimates to other similar cost estimates recorded at the Corporation to confirm consistent assumptions and methods applied across all of the Corporation’s nuclear decommissioning cost estimates.

•

With the assistance of our environmental specialists, we:

◦

Evaluated the methods used by management to estimate the underlying costs for nuclear decommissioning

◦

Developed a range of independent estimates for the cost of nuclear decommissioning based on peer industry data and compared to management’s estimate

◦

Completed a search of environmental regulations to identify any regulatory changes that may affect the nuclear decommissioning cost estimates.

ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries.  As required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, all intercompany transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.  Entergy’s Registrant Subsidiaries (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) also include their separate financial statements in this Form 10-K.  The Registrant Subsidiaries and many other Entergy subsidiaries also maintain accounts in accordance with FERC and other regulatory guidelines.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

In conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, the preparation of Entergy Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and the separate financial statements of the Registrant Subsidiaries requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Adjustments to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities may be necessary in the future to the extent that future estimates or actual results are different from the estimates used.

Revenues and Fuel Costs

See Note 19 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy’s and the Registrant Subsidiaries’ revenues and fuel costs.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and impairments.  Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis at rates based on the applicable estimated service lives of the various classes of property.  For the Registrant Subsidiaries, the original cost of plant retired or removed, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation.  Normal maintenance, repairs, and minor replacement costs are charged to operating expenses.  Certain combined-cycle gas turbine generating units are maintained under long-term service agreements with third-party service providers.  The costs under these agreements are split between operating expenses and capital additions based upon the nature of the work performed.  Substantially all of the Registrant Subsidiaries’ plant is subject to mortgage liens.

Electric plant includes the portions of Grand Gulf and Waterford 3 that were sold and leased back in prior periods.  For financial reporting purposes, these sale and leaseback arrangements are reflected as financing transactions.  In March 2016, Entergy Louisiana completed the first step in a two-step transaction to purchase the undivided interests in Waterford 3 that were previously being leased by acquiring a beneficial interest in the Waterford 3 leased assets.  In February 2017 the leases were terminated and the leased assets transferred to Entergy Louisiana.  See Note 10 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Louisiana’s purchase of the Waterford 3 leased assets.

The depreciation rates for Entergy Wholesale Commodities reflect the significantly reduced remaining estimated operating lives associated with management’s strategy to shut down and sell all of the remaining plants in Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ merchant nuclear fleet.  The decrease in the depreciation rate in 2018 for Entergy Wholesale Commodities is due to the decision in the third quarter 2017 to continue operating Palisades until May 31, 2022.

Entergy amortizes nuclear fuel using a units-of-production method.  Nuclear fuel amortization is included in fuel expense in the income statements.  Because the values of their long-lived assets are impaired, and their remaining estimated operating lives significantly reduced, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, except for Palisades, charge nuclear fuel costs directly to expense when incurred because their undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of these capital additions.

Jointly-Owned Generating Stations

Certain Entergy subsidiaries jointly own electric generating facilities with affiliates or third parties.  All parties are required to provide their own financing.  The investments, fuel expenses, and other operation and maintenance expenses associated with these generating stations are recorded by the Entergy subsidiaries to the extent of their respective undivided ownership interests.

As of

December 31, 2019

, the subsidiaries’ investment and accumulated depreciation in each of these generating stations were as follows:

Nuclear Refueling Outage Costs

Nuclear refueling outage costs are deferred during the outage and amortized over the estimated period to the next outage because these refueling outage expenses are incurred to prepare the units to operate for the next operating cycle without having to be taken off line.  Because the value of their long-lived assets are impaired, and their remaining estimated operating lives significantly reduced, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, except for Palisades, charge nuclear refueling outage costs directly to expense when incurred because their undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of these costs.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)

AFUDC represents the approximate net composite interest cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable return on the equity funds used for construction by the Registrant Subsidiaries.  AFUDC increases both the plant balance and earnings and is realized in cash through depreciation provisions included in the rates charged to customers.

Income Taxes

Entergy Corporation and the majority of its subsidiaries file a United States consolidated federal income tax return.  In September 2019, Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC and its regulated wholly owned subsidiaries including Entergy Arkansas, LLC, Entergy Louisiana, LLC, Entergy Mississippi, LLC, and Entergy New Orleans, LLC became eligible to and joined the Entergy Corporation consolidated federal income tax group.  These changes do not affect the accrual or allocation of income taxes for the Registrant Subsidiaries.  Each tax-paying entity records income taxes as if it were a separate taxpayer and consolidating adjustments are allocated to the tax filing entities in accordance with Entergy’s intercompany income tax allocation agreements.  Deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for certain losses and credits available for carryforward.

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates in the period in which the tax or rate was enacted.  See the “

Other Tax Matters

-

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

” section in Note 3 to the financial statements for discussion of the effects of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017.

The benefits of investment tax credits are deferred and amortized over the average useful life of the related property, as a reduction of income tax expense, for such credits associated with rate-regulated operations in accordance with ratemaking treatment.

because they were antidilutive.

Stock-based Compensation Plans

Entergy grants stock options, restricted stock, performance units, and restricted stock unit awards to key employees of the Entergy subsidiaries under its Equity Ownership Plans, which are shareholder-approved stock-based compensation plans.  These plans are described more fully in Note 12 to the financial statements.   The cost of the stock-based compensation is charged to income over the vesting period.  Awards under Entergy’s plans generally vest over three years. Entergy accounts for forfeitures of stock-based compensation when they occur. Entergy recognizes all income tax effects related to share-based payments through the income statement.

Accounting for the Effects of Regulation

Entergy’s Utility operating companies and System Energy are rate-regulated enterprises whose rates meet three criteria specified in accounting standards.  The Utility operating companies and System Energy have rates that (i) are approved by a body (its regulator) empowered to set rates that bind customers; (ii) are cost-based; and (iii) can be charged to and collected from customers.  These criteria may also be applied to separable portions of a utility’s business, such as the generation or transmission functions, or to specific classes of customers.  Because the Utility operating companies and System Energy meet these criteria, each of them capitalizes costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if the rate actions of its regulator make it probable that those costs will be recovered in future revenue.  Such capitalized costs are reflected as regulatory assets in the accompanying financial statements.  When an enterprise concludes that recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable, the regulatory asset must be removed from the entity’s balance sheet.

An enterprise that ceases to meet the three criteria for all or part of its operations should report that event in its financial statements.  In general, the enterprise no longer meeting the criteria should eliminate from its balance sheet all regulatory assets and liabilities related to the applicable operations.  Additionally, if it is determined that a regulated enterprise is no longer recovering all of its costs, it is possible that an impairment may exist that could require further write-offs of plant assets.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

Entergy Louisiana does not apply regulatory accounting standards to the Louisiana retail deregulated portion of River Bend, the


%

interest in River Bend formerly owned by Cajun, or its steam business, unless specific cost recovery is provided for in tariff rates.  The Louisiana retail deregulated portion of River Bend is operated under a deregulated asset plan representing a portion (approximately


%

) of River Bend plant costs, generation, revenues, and expenses established under a 1992 LPSC order.  The plan allows Entergy Louisiana to sell the electricity from the deregulated assets to Louisiana retail customers at

4.6

cents per kWh or off-system at higher prices, with certain provisions for sharing incremental revenue above

4.6

cents per kWh between customers and shareholders.

Regulatory Asset or Liability for Income Taxes

Accounting standards for income taxes provide that a regulatory asset or liability be recorded if it is probable that the currently determinable future increase or decrease in regulatory income tax expense will be recovered from or returned to customers through future rates.  There are two main sources of Entergy’s regulatory asset or liability for income taxes.  There is a regulatory asset related to the ratemaking treatment of the tax effects of book depreciation for the equity component of AFUDC that has been capitalized to property, plant, and equipment but for which there is no corresponding tax basis.  Equity-AFUDC is a component of property, plant, and equipment that is included in rate base when the plant is placed in service.  There is a regulatory liability related to the adjustment of Entergy’s net deferred income taxes that was required by the enactment in December 2017 of a change in the federal corporate income tax rate, which is discussed in Note 2 and 3 to the financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Entergy considers all unrestricted highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Securitization Recovery Trust Accounts

The funds that Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas hold in their securitization recovery trust accounts are not classified as cash and cash equivalents or restricted cash and cash equivalents because of their nature, uses, and restrictions. These funds are classified as part of other current assets and other investments, depending on the timeframe within which the Registrant Subsidiary expects to use the funds.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects Entergy’s best estimate of losses on the accounts receivable balances.  The allowance is based on accounts receivable agings, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.  Utility operating company customer accounts receivable are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements.

Investments

Entergy records decommissioning trust funds on the balance sheet at their fair value.  Effective January 1, 2018, with the adoption of ASU 2016-01, unrealized gains and losses on investments in equity securities held by the nuclear decommissioning trust funds are recorded in earnings as they occur rather than in other comprehensive income.  Because of the ability of the Registrant Subsidiaries to recover decommissioning costs in rates and in accordance with the regulatory treatment for decommissioning trust funds, the Registrant Subsidiaries have recorded an offsetting amount of unrealized gains/(losses) on investment securities in other regulatory liabilities/assets.  For the


%

interest in River Bend formerly owned by Cajun, Entergy Louisiana records an offsetting amount in other deferred credits for the unrealized trust earnings not currently expected to be needed to decommission the plant.  Decommissioning trust funds for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants do not meet the criteria for regulatory accounting treatment.  Accordingly, unrealized gains/(losses) recorded on the equity securities in the trust funds are recognized in



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

earnings.  Unrealized gains recorded on the available-for-sale debt securities in the trust funds are recognized in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders’ equity.  Unrealized losses (where cost exceeds fair market value) on the available-for-sale debt securities in the trust funds are also recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders’ equity unless the unrealized loss is other than temporary and therefore recorded in earnings.  A portion of Entergy’s decommissioning trust funds are held in a wholly-owned registered investment company, and unrealized gains and losses on both the equity and debt securities held in the registered investment company are recognized in earnings.  The assessment of whether an investment in an available-for-sale debt security has suffered an other-than-temporary impairment is based on whether Entergy has the intent to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized costs.  Further, if Entergy does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred and it is measured by the present value of cash flows expected to be collected less the amortized cost basis (credit loss).  Entergy’s trusts are managed by third parties who operate in accordance with agreements that define investment guidelines and place restrictions on the purchases and sales of investments. See Note 16 to the financial statements for details on the decommissioning trust funds.

Equity Method Investments

Entergy owns investments that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting because Entergy’s ownership level results in significant influence, but not control, over the investee and its operations.  Entergy records its share of the investee’s comprehensive earnings and losses in income and as an increase or decrease to the investment account.  Any cash distributions are charged against the investment account.  Entergy discontinues the recognition of losses on equity investments when its share of losses equals or exceeds its carrying amount for an investee plus any advances made or commitments to provide additional financial support.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Commodity Derivatives

The accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities require that all derivatives be recognized at fair value on the balance sheet, either as assets or liabilities, unless they meet various exceptions including the normal purchase/normal sale criteria.  The changes in the fair value of recognized derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and the type of hedge transaction.  Due to regulatory treatment, an offsetting regulatory asset or liability is recorded for changes in fair value of recognized derivatives for the Registrant Subsidiaries.

Contracts for commodities that will be physically delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold in the ordinary course of business, including certain purchases and sales of power and fuel, meet the normal purchase, normal sales criteria and are not recognized on the balance sheet.  Revenues and expenses from these contracts are reported on a gross basis in the appropriate revenue and expense categories as the commodities are received or delivered.

For other contracts for commodities in which Entergy is hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable-rate asset, liability, or forecasted transactions that qualify as cash flow hedges, the changes in the fair value of such derivative instruments are reported in other comprehensive income.  To qualify for hedge accounting, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be documented to include the risk management objective and strategy and, at inception and on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting the changes in the cash flows of the item being hedged.  Gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the periods when the underlying transactions actually occur.  Prior to 2019, the ineffective portions of all hedges are recognized in current-period earnings.  Effective January 1, 2019 with the adoption of ASU 2017-12 there will no longer be separate recognition of the ineffective portion of highly effective hedges.  Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in current-period earnings on a mark-to-market basis.

Entergy has determined that contracts to purchase uranium do not meet the definition of a derivative under the accounting standards for derivative instruments because they do not provide for net settlement and the uranium markets



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

are not sufficiently liquid to conclude that forward contracts are readily convertible to cash.  If the uranium markets do become sufficiently liquid in the future and Entergy begins to account for uranium purchase contracts as derivative instruments, the fair value of these contracts would be accounted for consistent with Entergy’s other derivative instruments.  See Note 15 to the financial statements for further details on Entergy’s derivative instruments and hedging activities.

Fair Values

The estimated fair values of Entergy’s financial instruments and derivatives are determined using historical prices, bid prices, market quotes, and financial modeling.  Considerable judgment is required in developing the estimates of fair value.  Therefore, estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that Entergy could realize in a current market exchange.  Gains or losses realized on financial instruments held by regulated businesses may be reflected in future rates and therefore do not affect net income.  Entergy considers the carrying amounts of most financial instruments classified as current assets and liabilities to be a reasonable estimate of their fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.  See Note 15 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

Entergy periodically reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain.  Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from such operations and assets.  Projected net cash flows depend on the expected operating life of the assets, the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining life of the assets.  Because the values of their long-lived assets are impaired, and their remaining estimated operating lives significantly reduced, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, except for Palisades, are charging additional expenditures for capital assets directly to expense when incurred because their undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of these capital additions.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussions of the impairments of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants.

River Bend AFUDC

The River Bend AFUDC gross-up is a regulatory asset that represents the incremental difference imputed by the LPSC between the AFUDC actually recorded by Entergy Louisiana on a net-of-tax basis during the construction of River Bend and what the AFUDC would have been on a pre-tax basis.  The imputed amount was only calculated on that portion of River Bend that the LPSC allowed in rate base and is being amortized through August 2025.

Reacquired Debt

The premiums and costs associated with reacquired debt of Entergy’s Utility operating companies and System Energy (except that portion allocable to the deregulated operations of Entergy Louisiana) are included in regulatory assets and are being amortized over the life of the related new issuances, or over the life of the original debt issuance if the debt is not refinanced, in accordance with ratemaking treatment.

Taxes Imposed on Revenue-Producing Transactions

Governmental authorities assess taxes that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer, including, but not limited to, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes.  Entergy presents these taxes on a net basis, excluding them from revenues, unless required to report them differently by a regulatory authority.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2016 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.”  The ASU requires entities to record a valuation allowance on financial instruments recorded at amortized cost or classified as available-for-sale debt securities for the total credit losses expected over the life of the instrument.  Increases and decreases in the valuation allowance will be recognized immediately in earnings.  Entergy adopted ASU 2016-13 in the first quarter 2020.  Adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not materially affect Entergy’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In September 2018 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service.”  The ASU requires entities to capitalize implementation costs associated with cloud computing arrangements classified as hosting arrangements and amortize those costs over the contract term.  These costs are required to be capitalized in the same line as prepayments of the costs, and subsequently amortized in the same lines as the hosting service element of the arrangement.  Entergy adopted ASU 2018-15 in the first quarter 2020.   Entergy adopted ASU 2018-15 on a prospective basis, which will affect its statement of financial position by presenting implementation costs for hosting arrangements as prepayments rather than utility plant, and will affect its results of operations by amortizing those costs as operation and maintenance expense, rather than depreciation and amortization, over the contract term of the arrangement.

” section in Note 3 to the financial statements for discussion of the effects of the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including its effects on Entergy’s and the Registrant Subsidiaries’ regulatory asset/liability for income taxes.

Entergy Arkansas

Consistent with its previously stated intent to return unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers as expeditiously as possible, Entergy Arkansas initiated a tariff proceeding in February 2018 proposing to establish a tax adjustment rider to provide retail customers with certain tax benefits of

$


million

associated with the Tax Act.  For the residential customer class, unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes were returned to customers over a 21-month period from April 2018 through December 2019.  For all other customer classes, unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes were returned to customers over a nine-month period from April 2018 through December 2018.  A true-up provision also was included in the rider, with any over- or under-returned unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes credited or billed to customers during the billing month of January 2020, with any residual amounts of over- or under-returned unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to be flowed through Entergy Arkansas’s energy cost recovery rider.  In March 2018 the APSC approved the tax adjustment rider effective with the first billing cycle of April 2018.

As discussed below, in July 2018, Entergy Arkansas made its formula rate plan filing to set its formula rate for the 2019 calendar year.  A hearing was held in May 2018 regarding the APSC’s inquiries into the effects of the Tax Act, including Entergy Arkansas’s proposal to utilize its formula rate plan rider for its customers to realize the remaining benefits of the Tax Act.  Entergy Arkansas’s formula rate plan rider included a netting adjustment that compared actual annual results to the allowed rate of return on common equity.  In July 2018 the APSC issued an order agreeing with Entergy Arkansas’s proposal to have the effects of the Tax Act on current income tax expense flow through Entergy Arkansas’s formula rate plan rider and with Entergy Arkansas’s treatment of protected and unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes.  The APSC also directed Entergy Arkansas to submit in the tax adjustment rider proceeding, discussed above, the adjustments to all other riders affected by the Tax Act and to include an amendment



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

for a true up mechanism where a rider affected by the Tax Act does not already contain a true-up mechanism.  Pursuant to a 2018 settlement agreement in Entergy Arkansas’s formula rate plan proceeding, Entergy Arkansas also removed the net operating loss accumulated deferred income tax asset caused by the Tax Act from Entergy Arkansas’s tax adjustment rider.  Entergy Arkansas’s compliance tariff filings were accepted by the APSC in October 2018.

Entergy Louisiana

In an electric formula rate plan settlement approved by the LPSC in April 2018 the parties agreed that Entergy Louisiana would return to customers one-half of its eligible unprotected excess deferred income taxes from May 2018 through December 2018 and return to customers the other half from January 2019 through August 2022.  In addition, the settlement provided that in order to flow back to customers certain other tax benefits created by the Tax Act, Entergy Louisiana established a regulatory liability effective January 1, 2018 in the amount of

$

9.1

million

per month to reflect these tax benefits already included in retail rates until new base rates under the formula rate plan were established in September 2018, and this regulatory liability was returned to customers over the September 2018 through August 2019 formula rate plan rate-effective period.  The LPSC staff and intervenors in the settlement reserved the right to obtain data from Entergy Louisiana to confirm the determination of excess accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the Tax Act and the analysis thereof as part of the formula rate plan review proceeding for the 2017 test year filing which, as discussed below, Entergy Louisiana filed in June 2018.

Entergy Mississippi

Entergy Mississippi filed its 2018 formula rate plan in March 2018 and included a proposal to return all of its unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers through rates or in exchange for other assets, or a combination of both, by the end of 2018.  In June 2018 the MPSC approved a stipulation filed by Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff in Entergy Mississippi’s formula rate plan filing that addressed Entergy Mississippi’s 2018 formula rate plan evaluation report and the ratemaking effects of the Tax Act.  The stipulation provided for incorporating the reduction of the statutory federal income tax rate through Entergy Mississippi’s formula rate plan.  The stipulation approved in June 2018 provided for the flow-back of protected excess accumulated deferred income taxes over the remaining lives of the assets through the formula rate plan.  The stipulation also provided for the offset of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes of

$

127.2

million

against net utility plant and

$

2.2

million

against other regulatory assets, and the return to customers of the remaining balance of  unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes as recovery of a portion of fuel oil inventory and customer bill credits over a three-month period from July 2018 through September 2018, with an insignificant true-up reflected in the November 2018 power management rider filing.  Entergy Mississippi recorded the reduction against net utility plant and other regulatory assets in June 2018.  In third quarter 2018, Entergy Mississippi returned unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes of

$

25.8

million

through customer bill credits and

$

5.8

million

through the sale of fuel oil inventory.

Entergy New Orleans

After enactment of the Tax Act the City Council passed a resolution ordering Entergy New Orleans to, effective January 1, 2018, record deferred regulatory liabilities to account for the Tax Act’s effect on Entergy New Orleans’s revenue requirement and to make a filing by mid-March 2018 regarding the Tax Act’s effects on Entergy New Orleans’s operating income and rate base and potential mechanisms for customers to receive benefits of the Tax Act.  The City Council’s resolution also directed Entergy New Orleans to request that Entergy Services file with the FERC for revisions of the Unit Power Sales Agreement and MSS-4 replacement tariffs to address the return of excess accumulated deferred income taxes.  Entergy submitted filings of this type to the FERC.

In March 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed its response to the resolution stating that the Tax Act reduced income tax expense from what was then reflected in rates by approximately

$

8.2

million

annually for electric operations and by approximately

$

1.3

million

annually for gas operations.  In the filing, Entergy New Orleans proposed to return to customers from June 2018 through August 2019 the benefits of the reduction in income tax expense and its unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes through a combination of bill credits and investments in energy efficiency

Notes to Financial Statements

programs, grid modernization, and Smart City projects.  Entergy New Orleans submitted supplemental information in April 2018 and May 2018.  Shortly thereafter, Entergy New Orleans and the City Council’s advisors reached an agreement in principle that provides for benefits that will be realized by Entergy New Orleans customers through bill credits that started in July 2018 and offsets to future investments in energy efficiency programs, grid modernization, and Smart City projects, as well as additional benefits related to the filings made at the FERC.  The agreement in principle was approved by the City Council in June 2018.

Entergy Texas

After enactment of the Tax Act the PUCT issued an order requiring most utilities, including Entergy Texas, beginning January 25, 2018, to record a regulatory liability for the difference between revenues collected under existing rates and revenues that would have been collected had existing rates been set using the new federal income tax rates and also for the balance of excess accumulated deferred income taxes.  Entergy Texas had previously provided information to the PUCT staff and stated that it expected the PUCT to address the lower tax expense as part of Entergy Texas’s rate case expected to be filed in May 2018.  Entergy Texas also stated that it would be inappropriate for the PUCT to require a refund of the reduction in income tax expense in 2018 resulting from the Act on a retroactive basis and without a comprehensive review of Entergy Texas’s cost of service and earned return on equity.

In May 2018, Entergy Texas filed its 2018 base rate case with the PUCT.  Entergy Texas’s proposed rates and revenues reflected the inclusion of the federal income tax reductions due to the Tax Act.  The PUCT issued an order in December 2018 establishing that 1)

$


million

be credited to customers through a rider to reflect the lower federal income tax rate applicable to Entergy Texas from January 2018 through the date new rates were implemented, 2)

$

242.5

million

of protected excess accumulated deferred income taxes be returned to customers through base rates under the average rate assumption method over the lives of the associated assets, and 3)

$

185.2

million

of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes be returned to customers through a rider.  The unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes rider includes carrying charges and is in effect over a period of 12 months for larger customers and over a period of four years for other customers.

System Energy

In a filing made with the FERC in March 2018, Entergy proposed revisions to the Unit Power Sales Agreement, among other agreements, to reflect the effects of the Tax Act.  In the filing System Energy proposed to return all of its unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to its customers by the end of 2018.  In May 2018 the FERC accepted System Energy’s proposed tax revisions with an effective date of June 1, 2018, subject to refund and the outcome of settlement and hearing procedures.  Settlement discussions terminated in April 2019, and the hearing is scheduled for March 2020.  The retail regulators of the Utility operating companies that are parties to the Unit Power Sales Agreement are challenging whether there are excess tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions related to nuclear decommissioning.

Fuel and purchased power cost recovery

The Utility operating companies are allowed to recover fuel and purchased power costs through fuel mechanisms included in electric and gas rates that are recorded as fuel cost recovery revenues.  The difference between revenues collected and the current fuel and purchased power costs is generally recorded as “Deferred fuel costs” on the Utility operating companies’ financial statements.

The table below shows the amount of deferred fuel costs as of

December 31, 2019

and


that Entergy expects to recover (or return to customers) through fuel mechanisms, subject to subsequent regulatory review.

Entergy Arkansas

Production Cost Allocation Rider

The APSC approved a production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to Entergy Arkansas as a result of the System Agreement proceedings, which are discussed in the “

System Agreement Cost Equalization Proceedings

” section below.

Energy Cost Recovery Rider

Entergy Arkansas’s retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly customer bills.  The rider utilizes the prior calendar-year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over- or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy costs for the prior calendar year.  The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs.

In January 2014, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion with the APSC relating to its upcoming energy cost rate redetermination filing that was made in March 2014.  In that motion, Entergy Arkansas requested that the APSC authorize Entergy Arkansas to exclude from the redetermination of its 2014 energy cost rate

$

65.9

million

of incremental fuel and replacement energy costs incurred in 2013 as a result of the ANO stator incident.  Entergy Arkansas requested that the APSC authorize Entergy Arkansas to retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance, with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information was available regarding various claims associated with the ANO stator incident.  In February 2014 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas’s request to retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance.  In July 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed for a change in rates pursuant to its formula rate plan rider.  In that proceeding, the APSC approved a settlement agreement agreed upon by the parties, including a provision that requires Entergy Arkansas to initiate a regulatory proceeding for the purpose of recovering funds currently withheld from rates and related to the stator incident, including the

$

65.9

million

of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs previously noted, subject to certain timelines and conditions set forth in the settlement agreement.  See the “

ANO Damage, Outage, and NRC Reviews

” section in Note 8 to the financial statements for further discussion of the ANO stator incident.

In March 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an increase in the rate from

$

0.01164

per kWh to

$

0.01547

per kWh.  The APSC staff filed testimony in March 2017 recommending that the redetermined rate be implemented with the first billing cycle of April 2017 under the normal operation of the tariff.  Accordingly, the redetermined rate went into effect on



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

March 31, 2017 pursuant to the tariff.  In July 2017 the Arkansas Attorney General requested additional information to support certain of the costs included in Entergy Arkansas’s 2017 energy cost rate redetermination.

In March 2018, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an increase in the rate from

$

0.01547

per kWh to

$

0.01882

per kWh.  The Arkansas Attorney General filed a response to Entergy Arkansas’s annual redetermination filing requesting that the APSC suspend the proposed tariff to investigate the amount of the redetermination or, alternatively, to allow recovery subject to refund. Among the reasons the Attorney General cited for suspension were questions pertaining to how Entergy Arkansas forecasted sales and potential implications of the Tax Act.  Entergy Arkansas replied to the Attorney General’s filing and stated that, to the extent there are questions pertaining to its load forecasting or the operation of the energy cost recovery rider, those issues exceed the scope of the instant rate redetermination. Entergy Arkansas also stated that potential effects of the Tax Act are appropriately considered in the APSC’s separate proceeding regarding potential implications of the tax law.  The APSC general staff filed a reply to the Attorney General’s filing and agreed that Entergy Arkansas’s filing complied with the terms of the energy cost recovery rider.  The redetermined rate became effective with the first billing cycle of April 2018.  Subsequently in April 2018 the APSC issued an order declining to suspend Entergy Arkansas’s energy cost recovery rider rate and declining to require further investigation at that time of the issues suggested by the Attorney General in the proceeding.  Following a period of discovery, the Attorney General filed a supplemental response in October 2018 raising new issues with Entergy Arkansas’s March 2018 rate redetermination and asserting that

$

45.7

million

of the increase should be collected subject to refund pending further investigation.  Entergy Arkansas filed to dismiss the Attorney General’s supplemental response, the APSC general staff filed a motion to strike the Attorney General’s filing, and the Attorney General filed a supplemental response disputing Entergy Arkansas and the APSC staff’s filing.  Applicable APSC rules and processes authorize its general staff to initiate periodic audits of Entergy Arkansas’s energy cost recovery rider.  In late-2018 the APSC general staff notified Entergy Arkansas it has initiated an audit of the 2017 fuel costs.  The time in which the audit will be complete is uncertain at this time.

In March 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected a decrease from

$

0.01882

per kWh to

$

0.01462

per kWh and became effective with the first billing cycle in April 2019.  In March 2019 the Arkansas Attorney General filed a response to Entergy Arkansas’s annual adjustment and included with its filing a motion for investigation of alleged overcharges to customers in connection with the FERC’s October 2018 order in the opportunity sales proceeding.  Entergy Arkansas filed its response to the Attorney General’s motion in April 2019 in which Entergy Arkansas stated its intent to initiate a proceeding to address recovery issues related to the October 2018 FERC order.  In May 2019, Entergy Arkansas initiated the opportunity sales recovery proceeding, discussed below, and requested that the APSC establish that proceeding as the single designated proceeding in which interested parties may assert claims related to the appropriate retail rate treatment of the FERC October 2018 order and related FERC orders in the opportunity sales proceeding.  In June 2019 the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas’s request and also denied the Attorney General’s motion in the energy cost recovery proceeding seeking an investigation into Entergy Arkansas’s annual energy cost recovery rider adjustment and referred the evaluation of such matters to the opportunity sales recovery proceeding.

Entergy Louisiana

Entergy Louisiana recovers electric fuel and purchased power costs for the billing month based upon the level of such costs incurred two months prior to the billing month.  Entergy Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustments include estimates for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

In July 2014 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of the fuel adjustment clause filings by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, whose business was combined with Entergy Louisiana in 2015.  The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause for the period from 2010 through 2013.  In January 2019 the LPSC staff consultant issued its audit report. In its report, the LPSC staff consultant recommended that Entergy Louisiana refund approximately

$

900,000

, plus interest, to customers based



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

upon the imputation of a claim of vendor fault in servicing its nuclear plant.  Entergy Louisiana recorded a provision in the first quarter 2019 for the potential outcome of the audit.    In August 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed direct testimony challenging the basis for the LPSC staff’s recommended disallowance and providing an alternative calculation of replacement power costs should it be determined that a disallowance is appropriate.  Entergy Louisiana’s calculation would require no refund to customers.

Entergy Louisiana recorded a provision in the first quarter 2019 for the potential outcome of the audit.  In August 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed direct testimony challenging the basis for the LPSC staff’s recommended disallowance and providing an alternative calculation of replacement power costs should it be determined that a disallowance is appropriate.  Entergy Louisiana’s calculation would require a refund to customers of approximately

$

4.3

million

, plus interest, as compared to the LPSC staff’s recommendation of

$

7.3

million

, plus interest.  Responsive testimony was filed by the LPSC staff and intervenors in September 2019; all parties either agreed with or did not oppose Entergy Louisiana’s alternative calculation of replacement power costs.

In November 2019 the pending LPSC proceedings for the 2010-2013 Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana audits were consolidated to facilitate a settlement of both fuel audits.  In December 2019 an unopposed settlement was reached that requires a refund to legacy Entergy Louisiana customers  of approximately

$

2.3

million

, including interest, and no refund to legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana customers.  The LPSC approved the settlement in January 2020.

In June 2016 the LPSC issued notice of audits of Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause filings and purchased gas adjustment clause filings for the period 2014 through 2015.  In recognition of the business combination that occurred in 2015, the audit notice was issued to Entergy Louisiana and also includes a review of charges to legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana customers prior to the business combination.  The audits include a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause for the period from 2014 through 2015 and charges flowed through Entergy Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustment clause for the period from 2012 through 2015.  Discovery commenced in March 2017.  No report of audit has been issued.

In May 2018 the LPSC staff provided notice of audits of Entergy Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustment clause filings.  The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustment clause for the period from 2016 through 2017.  Discovery commenced in September 2018.  No report of audit has been issued.

Entergy Mississippi

Entergy Mississippi’s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider that is adjusted annually to reflect accumulated over- or under-recoveries.  Entergy Mississippi’s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC.

In January 2017 the MPSC certified to the Mississippi Legislature the audit reports of its independent auditors for the fuel year ending September 30, 2016.  In November 2017 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff separately engaged a consultant to review the September 2016 outage at the Grand Gulf Nuclear Station and to review ongoing operations at Grand Gulf.  This engagement continues, and subsequently, was expanded to include all outages at Grand Gulf that occurred through 2019.

In November 2017, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider.  The calculation of the annual factor included an under-recovery of approximately



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

$

as of September 30, 2018.  In January 2019 the MPSC approved the proposed energy cost factor effective for February 2019 bills.

In November 2019, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider.  The calculation of the annual factor included an over-recovery of approximately

$

39.6

million

as of September 30, 2019.  In January 2020 the MPSC approved the proposed energy cost factor effective for February 2020 bills.

Mississippi Attorney General Complaint

The Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in state court in December 2008 against Entergy Corporation, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Services, and Entergy Power alleging, among other things, violations of Mississippi statutes, fraud, and breach of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting an accounting and restitution.  The complaint is wide ranging and relates to tariffs and procedures under which Entergy Mississippi purchases power not generated in Mississippi to meet electricity demand.  Entergy believes the complaint is unfounded.  In December 2008 the defendant Entergy companies removed the Attorney General’s lawsuit to U.S. District Court in Jackson, Mississippi.

In June 2010 the MPSC authorized the deferral of certain legal expenses associated with this litigation until it is resolved.  As of December 31, 2019, Entergy Mississippi has a regulatory asset of

$

29.5

million

for these deferred legal expenses.  In April 2019 the District Court remanded the Attorney General’s lawsuit to the Hinds County Chancery Court.  A hearing on procedural and dispositive motions was held in August 2019.  In December 2019 the Hinds County Chancery Court issued its ruling granting the motion for summary judgment filed by the Entergy defendants.  The Chancery Court found it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and that the claims fall under the purview of the FERC.  In February 2020 the Chancery Court entered a final order dismissing all claims.  The order was approved by counsel for the Attorney General, and dismisses with prejudice all claims and matters in dispute and states that the plaintiff will not seek an appeal or further relief and that all matters in dispute have been resolved.

Entergy New Orleans

Entergy New Orleans’s electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

Entergy New Orleans’s gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges.

Entergy Texas

Entergy Texas’s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including interest, not recovered in base rates.   Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix.  The amounts collected under Entergy Texas’s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT.  A fuel reconciliation is required to be filed at least once every three years and outside of a base rate case filing.

In July 2015 certain parties filed briefs in a PUCT proceeding asserting that Entergy Texas should refund to retail customers an additional

$

10.9

million

in bandwidth remedy payments Entergy Texas received related to calendar



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

year 2006 production costs.  In October 2015 an ALJ issued a proposal for decision recommending that the additional bandwidth remedy payments be refunded to retail customers.  In January 2016 the PUCT issued its order affirming the ALJ’s recommendation, and Entergy Texas filed a motion for rehearing of the PUCT’s decision, which the PUCT denied.  In March 2016, Entergy Texas filed a complaint in Federal District Court for the Western District of Texas and a petition in the Travis County (State) District Court appealing the PUCT’s decision.  The pending appeals did not stay the PUCT’s decision.  In April 2016, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT an application to refund to customers approximately

$

56.2

million

.  The refund resulted from (i)

$

41.8

million

of fuel cost recovery over-collections through February 2016, (ii) the

$

10.9

million

in bandwidth remedy payments, discussed above, that Entergy Texas received related to calendar year 2006 production costs, and (iii)

$

3.5

million

in bandwidth remedy payments that Entergy Texas received related to 2006-2008 production costs.  In June 2016, Entergy Texas filed an unopposed settlement agreement that added additional over-recovered fuel costs for the months of March and April 2016.  The settlement resulted in a

$


million

refund.  The ALJ approved the refund on an interim basis and it was made to most customers over a four-month period beginning with the first billing cycle of July 2016.  In July 2016 the PUCT issued an order approving the interim refund.  The federal appeal of the PUCT’s January 2016 decision was heard in December 2016, and the Federal District Court granted Entergy Texas’s requested relief.  In January 2017 the PUCT and an intervenor filed petitions for appeal of the Federal District Court ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  Oral argument was held before the Fifth Circuit in February 2018.  In April 2018 the Fifth Circuit reversed the decision of the Federal District Court, reinstating the original PUCT decision.  In October 2018, Entergy Texas filed notice of nonsuit in its appeal to the Travis County District Court regarding the PUCT’s January 2016 decision.

In July 2016, Entergy Texas filed an application to reconcile its fuel and purchased power costs for the period April 1, 2013 through March 31, 2016.  During the reconciliation period, Entergy Texas incurred approximately

$

1.77

billion

in Texas jurisdictional eligible fuel and purchased power expenses, net of certain revenues credited to such expenses and other adjustments.  Entergy Texas estimated an over-recovery balance of approximately

$

19.3

million

, including interest, which Entergy Texas requested authority to carry over as the beginning balance for the subsequent reconciliation period beginning April 2016.  Entergy Texas also noted, however, that the estimated

$

19.3

million

over collection was being refunded to customers as a portion of the interim fuel refund beginning with the first billing cycle of July 2016, discussed above.  Entergy Texas also requested a prudence finding for each of the fuel-related contracts and arrangements entered into or modified during the reconciliation period that have not been reviewed by the PUCT in a prior proceeding.  In December 2016, Entergy Texas entered into a stipulation and settlement agreement resulting in a

$


million

disallowance not associated with any particular issue raised and a refund of the over-recovery balance of

$


million

as of November 30, 2016, to most customers beginning April 2017 through June 2017.  This settlement was developed concurrently with the stipulation and settlement agreement in the 2016 transmission cost recovery factor rider amendment discussed below, and the terms and conditions in both settlements are interdependent.  The fuel reconciliation settlement was approved by the PUCT in March 2017 and the refunds were made.

In June 2017, Entergy Texas filed an application for a fuel refund of approximately

$

30.7

million

for the months of December 2016 through April 2017.  For most customers, the refunds flowed through bills for the months of July 2017 through September 2017.  The fuel refund was approved by the PUCT in August 2017.

In December 2017, Entergy Texas filed an application for a fuel refund of approximately

$

30.5

million

for the months of May 2017 through October 2017.  Also in December 2017, the PUCT’s ALJ approved the refund on an interim basis.  For most customers, the refunds flowed through bills from January 2018 through March 2018.  The fuel refund was approved by the PUCT in March 2018.

In September 2019, Entergy Texas filed an application to reconcile its fuel and purchased power costs for the period from April 2016 through March 2019.  During the reconciliation period, Entergy Texas incurred approximately

$

1.6

billion

in Texas jurisdictional eligible fuel and purchased power expenses, net of certain revenues credited to such expenses and other adjustments.  Entergy Texas estimated an under-recovery balance of approximately

$

25.8

million

, including interest, which Entergy Texas requested authority to carry over as the beginning balance for the subsequent reconciliation period beginning April 2019.  The proceeding is currently pending.

for this filing.  By operation of the formula rate plan, Entergy Arkansas’s recovery of the revenue requirement is subject to a

four

percent annual revenue constraint.  Because Entergy Arkansas’s revenue requirement in this filing exceeded the constraint, the resulting increase was limited to

four

percent of total revenue, which originally was

$

65.4

million

but was increased to

$

66.7

million

based upon the APSC staff’s updated calculation of 2018 revenue.  In October 2018, Entergy Arkansas and the parties to the proceeding filed joint motions to approve a partial settlement agreement as to certain factual issues and agreed to brief contested legal issues.  In November 2018 the APSC held a hearing and was briefed on a contested legal issue.  In December 2018 the APSC issued a decision related to the initial legal brief, approved the partial settlement agreement and

$

million

revenue requirement increase, as well as Entergy Arkansas’s formula rate plan, with updated rates going into effect for the first billing cycle of January 2019.

2019 Formula Rate Plan Filing

In July 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2019 formula rate plan filing to set its formula rate for the 2020 calendar year.  The filing contained an evaluation of Entergy Arkansas’s earnings for the projected year 2020 and a netting adjustment for the historical year 2018.  The total proposed formula rate plan rider revenue change designed to produce a target rate of return on common equity of

9.75

%

is

$

15.3

million

, which is based upon a deficiency of approximately

$

61.9

million

for the 2020 projected year, netted with a credit of approximately

$

46.6

million

in the 2018 historical year netting adjustment.  During 2018 Entergy Arkansas experienced higher-than expected sales volume, and actual costs were lower than forecasted.  These changes, coupled with a reduced income tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, resulted in the credit for the historical year netting adjustment.  In the fourth quarter 2018,



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

Entergy Arkansas recorded a provision of

$

35.1

million

that reflected the estimate of the historical year netting adjustment that was expected to be included in the 2019 filing.  In 2019, Entergy Arkansas recorded additional provisions totaling

$

11.5

million

to reflect the updated estimate of the historical year netting adjustment included in the 2019 filing.  In October 2019 other parties in the proceeding filed their errors and objections requesting certain adjustments to Entergy Arkansas’s filing that would reduce or eliminate Entergy Arkansas’s proposed revenue change. Entergy Arkansas filed its response addressing the requested adjustments in October 2019.  In its response, Entergy Arkansas accepted certain of the adjustments recommended by the General Staff of the APSC that would reduce the proposed formula rate plan rider revenue change to

$


million

.  Entergy Arkansas disputed the remaining adjustments proposed by the parties.  In October 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed a unanimous settlement agreement with the other parties in the proceeding seeking APSC approval of a revised total formula rate plan rider revenue change of

$

10.1

million

.  In its July 2019 formula rate plan filing, Entergy Arkansas proposed to recover an

$

11.2

million

regulatory asset, amortized over five years, associated with specific costs related to the potential construction of scrubbers at the White Bluff plant.  Although Entergy Arkansas does not concede that the regulatory asset lacks merit, for purposes of reaching a settlement on the total formula rate plan rider amount, Entergy Arkansas agreed not to include the White Bluff scrubber regulatory asset cost in the 2019 formula rate plan filing or future filings.  Entergy Arkansas recorded a write-off in 2019 of the

$

11.2

million

White Bluff scrubber regulatory asset.  In December 2019 the APSC approved the settlement as being in the public interest and approved Entergy Arkansas’s compliance tariff effective with the first billing cycle of January 2020.

Internal Restructuring

In November 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed an application with the APSC seeking authorization to undertake a restructuring that would result in the transfer of substantially all of the assets and operations of Entergy Arkansas to a new entity, which would ultimately be owned by an existing Entergy subsidiary holding company.  In July 2018, Entergy Arkansas filed a settlement, reached by all parties in the APSC proceeding, resolving all issues.  The APSC approved the settlement agreement and restructuring in August 2018.  Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Entergy Arkansas will credit retail customers

$

39.6

million

over six years, beginning in 2019.  Entergy Arkansas also received the required FERC and NRC approvals.

In November 2018, Entergy Arkansas undertook a multi-step restructuring, including the following:

•

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. redeemed its outstanding preferred stock at the aggregate redemption price of approximately

$

32.7

million

.

•

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. converted from an Arkansas corporation to a Texas corporation.

•

Under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Entergy Arkansas, Inc. allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy Arkansas Power, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Entergy Arkansas Power), and Entergy Arkansas Power assumed substantially all of the liabilities of Entergy Arkansas, Inc., in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC.  Entergy Arkansas, Inc. remained in existence and held the membership interests in Entergy Arkansas Power.

•

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. contributed the membership interests in Entergy Arkansas Power to an affiliate (Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and subsidiary of Entergy Corporation).  As a result of the contribution, Entergy Arkansas Power is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC.

In December 2018, Entergy Arkansas, Inc. changed its name to Entergy Utility Property, Inc., and Entergy Arkansas Power then changed its name to Entergy Arkansas, LLC.  Entergy Arkansas, LLC holds substantially all of the assets, and assumed substantially all of the liabilities, of Entergy Arkansas, Inc.  The transaction was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control.

2016 Formula Rate Plan Filing

In May 2017, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2016 calendar year operations.  The evaluation report reflected an earned return on common equity of

9.84

%

.  As such, no adjustment to base formula rate plan revenue was required.  Adjustments, however, were required under the formula rate plan; the 2016 formula rate plan evaluation report showed a decrease in formula rate plan revenue of approximately

$

16.9

million

, comprised of a decrease in legacy Entergy Louisiana formula rate plan revenue of

$

3.5

million

, a decrease in legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana formula rate plan revenue of

$

9.7

million

, and a decrease in incremental formula rate plan revenue of

$

3.7

million

.  Additionally, the formula rate plan evaluation report called for a decrease of

$

40.5

million

in the MISO cost recovery revenue requirement from

$

46.8

million

to

$

6.3

million

.  Rates reflecting these adjustments were implemented with the first billing cycle of September 2017, subject to refund.  In September 2017 the LPSC staff issued its report indicating that no changes to Entergy Louisiana’s original formula rate plan evaluation report were required but reserved for several issues, including Entergy Louisiana’s September 2017 update to its formula rate plan evaluation report.  In July 2018, Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff filed an unopposed joint report setting forth a correction to the annualization calculation, the effect of which was a net

$

3.5

million

revenue requirement reduction and indicating that there are no outstanding issues with the 2016 formula rate plan report, the supplemental report, or the interim updates.  In September 2018 the LPSC approved the unopposed joint report.

Formula Rate Plan Extension Through 2019 Test Year

In August 2017, Entergy Louisiana filed a request with the LPSC seeking to extend its formula rate plan for three years (2017-2019) with limited modifications of its terms.  In April 2018 the LPSC approved an unopposed joint motion filed by Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff that settled the matter and extended the formula rate plan for three years, providing for rates through at least August 2021.  In addition to retaining the major features of the traditional formula rate plan, substantive features of the extended formula rate plan include:

•

a mid-point reset of formula rate plan revenues to a

9.95

%

earned return on common equity for the 2017 test year and for the St. Charles Power Station when it enters commercial operation;

•

a

9.8

%

target earned return on common equity for the 2018 and 2019 test years;

•

narrowing of the common equity bandwidth to plus or minus


basis points around the target earned return on common equity;

•

a cap on potential revenue increase of

$


million

for the 2018 evaluation period, and

$


million

for the cumulative 2018 and 2019 evaluation periods, on formula rate plan cost of service rate increases (the cap excludes rate changes associated with the transmission recovery mechanism described below and rate changes associated with additional capacity);

•

a framework for the flow back of certain tax benefits created by the Tax Act to customers, as described in “Regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” above; and

•

a transmission recovery mechanism providing for the opportunity to recover certain transmission-related expenditures in excess of

$


million

annually for projects placed in service up to one month prior to rate change outside of sharing that is designed to operate in a fashion similar to the additional capacity mechanism.

Entergy Louisiana has indicated its intent to seek an extension of its formula rate plan on terms similar to the existing terms.

2017 Formula Rate Plan Filing

In June 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2017 calendar year operations.  The 2017 test year evaluation report produced an earned return on equity of

8.16

%

, due in large part to revenue-neutral realignments to other recovery mechanisms.  Without these realignments, the evaluation report produces an earned return on equity of

9.88

%

and a resulting base rider formula rate plan revenue increase of

$

4.8

million

.  Excluding the Tax Act credits provided for by the tax reform adjustment mechanisms, total formula rate plan revenues were further increased by a total of

$


million

as a result of the evaluation report due to adjustments to the additional capacity and MISO cost recovery mechanisms of the formula rate plan, and implementation of the transmission recovery mechanism.  In August 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed a supplemental formula rate plan evaluation report to reflect changes from the 2016 test year formula rate plan proceedings, a decrease to the transmission recovery mechanism to reflect lower actual capital additions, and a decrease to evaluation period expenses to reflect the terms of a new power sales agreement.  Based on the August 2018 update, Entergy Louisiana recognized a total decrease in formula rate plan revenue of approximately

$

17.6

million

. Results of the updated 2017 evaluation report filing were implemented with the September 2018 billing month subject to refund and review by the LPSC staff and intervenors.  In accordance with the terms of the formula rate plan, in September 2018 the LPSC staff and intervenors submitted their responses to Entergy Louisiana’s original formula rate plan evaluation report and supplemental compliance updates.  The LPSC staff asserted objections/reservations regarding 1) Entergy Louisiana’s proposed rate adjustments associated with the return of excess accumulated deferred income taxes pursuant to the Tax Act and the treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes related to reductions of rate base; 2) Entergy Louisiana’s reservation regarding treatment of a regulatory asset related to certain special orders by the LPSC; and 3) test year expenses billed from Entergy Services to Entergy Louisiana.  Intervenors also objected to Entergy Louisiana’s treatment of the regulatory asset related to certain special orders by the LPSC.  A procedural schedule has not yet been established to resolve these issues.

Entergy Louisiana also included in its filing a presentation of an initial proposal to combine the legacy Entergy Louisiana and legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana residential rates, which combination, if approved, would be accomplished on a revenue-neutral basis intended not to affect the rates of other customer classes.

Commercial operation at St. Charles Power Station commenced in May 2019.  In May 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed an update to its 2017 formula rate plan evaluation report to include the estimated first-year revenue requirement of

$

109.5

million

associated with the St. Charles Power Station.  The resulting interim adjustment to rates became effective with the first billing cycle of June 2019.

2018 Formula Rate Plan Filing

In May 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2018 calendar year operations.  The 2018 test year evaluation report produced an earned return on common equity of

10.61

%

leading to a base rider formula rate plan revenue decrease of

$

8.9

million

.  While base rider formula rate plan revenue will decrease as a result of this filing, overall formula rate plan revenues will increase by approximately

$

118.7

million

.  This outcome is primarily driven by a reduction to the credits previously flowed through the tax reform adjustment mechanism and an increase in the transmission recovery mechanism, partially offset by reductions in the additional capacity mechanism revenue requirements and extraordinary cost items.  The filing is subject to review by the LPSC.  Resulting rates were implemented in September 2019, subject to refund.

Entergy Louisiana also included in its filing a presentation of an initial proposal to combine the legacy Entergy Louisiana and legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana residential rates, which combination, if approved, would be accomplished on a revenue-neutral basis intended not to affect the rates of other customer classes.  Entergy Louisiana contemplates that any combination of residential rates resulting from this request would be implemented with the results of the 2019 test year formula rate plan filing.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

Several parties intervened in the proceeding and the LPSC staff filed its report of objections/reservations in accordance with the applicable provisions of the formula rate plan.  In its report the LPSC staff re-urged reservations with respect to the outstanding issues from the 2017 test year formula rate plan filing and disputed the inclusion of certain affiliate costs for test years 2017 and 2018.  The LPSC staff objected to Entergy Louisiana’s proposal to combine residential rates but proposed the setting of a status conference to establish a procedural schedule to more fully address the issue.  The LPSC staff also reserved its right to object to the treatment of the sale of Willow Glen reflected in the evaluation report and to the August 2019 compliance update, which was made primarily to update the capital additions reflected in the formula rate plan’s transmission recovery mechanism, based on limited time to review it.  Additionally, since the completion of certain transmission projects, the LPSC staff has issued supplemental data requests addressing the prudence of Entergy Louisiana’s expenditures in connection with those projects.  Entergy Louisiana is in the process of responding to those requests.

Investigation of Costs Billed by Entergy Services

In November 2018 the LPSC issued a notice of proceeding initiating an investigation into costs incurred by Entergy Services that are included in the retail rates of Entergy Louisiana.  As stated in the notice of proceeding, the LPSC observed an increase in capital construction-related costs incurred by Entergy Services.  Discovery was issued and included efforts to seek highly detailed information on a broad range of matters unrelated to the scope of the audit.  There has been no further activity in the investigation since May 2019.

Waterford 3 Replacement Steam Generator Project

Following the completion of the Waterford 3 replacement steam generator project, the LPSC undertook a prudence review in connection with a filing made by Entergy Louisiana in April 2013 with regard to the following aspects of the replacement project: 1) project management; 2) cost controls; 3) success in achieving stated objectives; 4) the costs of the replacement project; and 5) the outage length and replacement power costs.  In July 2014 the LPSC staff filed testimony recommending potential project and replacement power cost disallowances of up to

$


million

, citing a need for further explanation or documentation from Entergy Louisiana.  An intervenor filed testimony recommending disallowance of

$


million

of incremental project costs, claiming the steam generator fabricator was imprudent.   Entergy Louisiana provided further documentation and explanation requested by the LPSC staff.  An evidentiary hearing was held in December 2014.  Entergy Louisiana believed that the replacement steam generator costs were prudently incurred and applicable legal principles supported their recovery in rates.  Nevertheless, Entergy Louisiana recorded a write-off of

$


million

of Waterford 3’s plant balance in December 2014 because of the uncertainty at the time associated with the resolution of the prudence review.  In December 2015 the ALJ issued a proposed recommendation, which was subsequently finalized, concluding that Entergy Louisiana prudently managed the Waterford 3 replacement steam generator project, including the selection, use, and oversight of contractors, and could not reasonably have anticipated the damage to the steam generators.  Nevertheless, the ALJ concluded that Entergy Louisiana was liable for the conduct of its contractor and subcontractor and, therefore, recommended a disallowance of

$


million

in capital costs.  Additionally, the ALJ concluded that Entergy Louisiana did not sufficiently justify the incurrence of

$


million

in replacement power costs during the replacement outage.  Although the ALJ’s recommendation had not yet been considered by the LPSC, after considering the progress of the proceeding in light of the ALJ recommendation, Entergy Louisiana recorded in the fourth quarter 2015 approximately

$


million

in charges, including a

$


million

asset write-off and a

$


million

regulatory charge, to reflect that a portion of the assets associated with the Waterford 3 replacement steam generator project was no longer probable of recovery.  Entergy Louisiana maintained that the ALJ’s recommendation contained significant factual and legal errors.

In October 2016 the parties reached a settlement in this matter.  The settlement was approved by the LPSC in December 2016.  The settlement effectively provided for an agreed-upon disallowance of

$


million

of plant, which had been previously written off by Entergy Louisiana, as discussed above.  The refund to customers of approximately

$


million

as a result of the settlement approved by the LPSC was made to customers in January 2017.  Of the

$


million

of refunds,

$


million

was credited to customers through Entergy Louisiana’s formula rate plan, outside of sharing, and

$


million

through its fuel adjustment clause.  Entergy Louisiana had previously recorded a provision of



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

$


million

for this refund.  The previously-recorded provision included the cumulative revenues recorded through December 2016 related to the

$


million

of disallowed plant.  An additional regulatory charge of

$


million

was recorded in fourth quarter 2016 to reflect the effects of the settlement.  The settlement also provided that Entergy Louisiana could retain the value associated with potential service credits agreed to by the project contractor, to the extent they are realized in the future.  Following a review by the parties, an unopposed joint report of proceedings was filed by the LPSC staff and Entergy Louisiana in May 2017 and the LPSC accepted the joint report of proceedings resolving the matter.

2016 Rate Stabilization Plan Filing

In January 2017, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2016.  The filing of the evaluation report for test year 2016 reflected an earned return on common equity of

6.37

%

.  In April 2017 the LPSC approved a joint report of proceedings and Entergy Louisiana submitted a revised evaluation report reflecting a

annual increase in revenue with rates implemented with the first billing cycle of May 2017.

2017 Rate Stabilization Plan Filing

In January 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2017.  The filing of the evaluation report for the test year 2017 reflected an earned return on common equity of

9.06

%

.  This earned return is below the earnings sharing band of the rate stabilization plan and results in a rate increase of

$

0.1

million

.  Due to the enactment in late-December 2017 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Entergy Louisiana did not have adequate time to reflect the effects of this tax legislation in the rate stabilization plan.  In April 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed a supplemental evaluation report for the test year ended September 2017, reflecting the effects of the Tax Act, including a proposal to use the unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to offset approximately

$

1.4

million

of storm restoration deferred operation and maintenance costs incurred by Entergy Louisiana in connection with the August 2016 flooding disaster in its gas service area.  The supplemental filing reflects an earned return on common equity of

10.79

%

.  As-filed rates from the supplemental filing were implemented, subject to refund, with customers receiving a cost reduction of approximately

$

0.7

million

effective with bills rendered on and after the first billing cycle of May 2018, as well as a

$

0.2

million

reduction in the gas infrastructure rider effective with bills rendered on and after the first billing cycle of July 2018.  In October 2019 the LPSC staff issued its report finding that Entergy Louisiana’s filing complied with the terms of the rate stabilization plan but recommending an additional refund of

$

0.7

million

related to the Tax Act.  A procedural schedule has not been established.

2018 Rate Stabilization Plan Filing

In January 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2018. The filing of the evaluation report for the test year 2018 reflected an earned return on common equity of

2.69

%

.  This earned return is below the earning sharing band of the gas rate stabilization plan and results in a rate increase of

$

2.8

million

.  Entergy Louisiana made a compliance filing in April 2019 and rates were implemented during the first billing cycle of May 2019, subject to refund and final LPSC review.  The proceeding is currently in its discovery phase.

In August 2019, Entergy Louisiana submitted an application to the LPSC seeking extension of the gas rate stabilization plan for the 2019-2021 test years on the same terms as those approved for the 2018 test year.  The LPSC established a procedural schedule to address this request with a hearing scheduled in May 2020.  Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff recently submitted a joint stipulation that recommends approval of the requested extension with certain modifications to the current terms, including a

9.8

evaluation period cost rate for common equity and provisions for the return of the excess accumulated deferred income tax to customers on a dollar for dollar basis in a manner consistent with IRS normalization rules.  The LPSC approved the joint stipulation in January 2020.

2019 Rate Stabilization Plan Filing

In January 2020, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2019.  The filing of the evaluation report for the test year 2019 reflected an earned return on common equity of

In June 2017, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a stipulation that confirmed that Entergy Mississippi’s earned returns for both the 2016 look-back filing and 2017 test year were within the respective formula rate plan bandwidths.  In June 2017 the MPSC approved the stipulation, which resulted in no change in rates.

In March 2018, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2018 test year filing and 2017 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi’s earned return for the historical 2017 calendar year and projected earned return for the 2018 calendar year, in large part as a result of the lower federal corporate income tax rate effective in 2018, to be within the formula rate plan bandwidth, resulting in no change in rates.  In June 2018, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a stipulation that confirmed that Entergy Mississippi’s earned returns for both the 2017 look-back filing and 2018 test year were within the respective formula rate plan bandwidths.  In June 2018 the MPSC approved the stipulation, which resulted in no change in rates.  See “Regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” above for additional discussion regarding the treatment of the effects of the lower federal corporate income tax rate.

In October 2018, Entergy Mississippi proposed revisions to its formula rate plan that would provide for a mechanism in the formula rate plan, the interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism, to recover the non-fuel related costs of additional owned capacity acquired by Entergy Mississippi, including the non-fuel annual ownership costs of the Choctaw Generating Station, as well as to allow similar cost recovery treatment for other future capacity acquisitions, such as the Sunflower Solar Facility, that are approved by the MPSC.  In December 2019 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi’s proposed revisions to its formula rate plan to provide for an interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism, which Entergy Mississippi began billing in January 2020.  The MPSC must approve recovery through the interim capacity rate adjustment for each new resource.  In addition, the MPSC approved revisions to the formula rate plan which allows Entergy Mississippi to begin billing rate adjustments effective April 1 of the filing year on a temporary basis subject to refund or credit to customers, subject to final MPSC order.  The MPSC also authorized Entergy Mississippi to remove vegetation management costs from the formula rate plan and recover these costs through the establishment of a vegetation management rider.

Internal Restructuring

In March 2018, Entergy Mississippi filed an application with the MPSC seeking authorization to undertake a restructuring that would result in the transfer of substantially all of the assets and operations of Entergy Mississippi to a new entity, which would ultimately be held by an existing Entergy subsidiary holding company.  In September 2018, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into and filed a joint stipulation regarding the restructuring filing.  In September 2018 the MPSC issued an order accepting the stipulation in its entirety and approving the restructuring and credits of

$

•

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. converted from a Mississippi corporation to a Texas corporation.

•

Under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Entergy Mississippi, Inc. allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy Mississippi Power and Light, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Entergy Mississippi Power and Light), and Entergy Mississippi Power and Light assumed substantially all of the liabilities of Entergy Mississippi, Inc., in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC.  Entergy Mississippi, Inc. remained in existence and held the membership interests in Entergy Mississippi Power and Light.

•

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. contributed the membership interests in Entergy Mississippi Power and Light to an affiliate (Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and subsidiary of Entergy Corporation).  As a result of the contribution, Entergy Mississippi Power and Light is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC.

In December 2018, Entergy Mississippi, Inc. changed its name to Entergy Utility Enterprises, Inc., and Entergy Mississippi Power and Light then changed its name to Entergy Mississippi, LLC.  Entergy Mississippi, LLC holds substantially all of the assets, and assumed substantially all of the liabilities, of Entergy Mississippi, Inc.

Filings with the City Council (Entergy New Orleans)

Retail Rates

As a provision of the settlement agreement approved by the City Council in May 2015 providing for the transfer from Entergy Louisiana to Entergy New Orleans of certain assets that supported the provision of service to Entergy Louisiana’s customers in Algiers, it was agreed that, with limited exceptions, no action may be taken with respect to Entergy New Orleans’s base rates until rates are implemented from a base rate case that must be filed for its electric and gas operations in 2018.  This provision eliminated the formula rate plan applicable to Algiers operations.  The limited exceptions included continued implementation of the then-remaining two years of the four-year phased-in rate increase for the Algiers area and certain exceptional cost increases or decreases in the base revenue requirement.  An additional provision of the settlement agreement allowed for continued recovery of the revenue requirement associated with the capacity and energy from Ninemile 6 received by Entergy New Orleans under a power purchase agreement with Entergy Louisiana (Algiers PPA).  The settlement authorized Entergy New Orleans to recover the remaining revenue requirement related to the Algiers PPA through base rates charged to Algiers customers.  The settlement also provided for continued implementation of the Algiers MISO recovery rider.

A 2008 rate case settlement included

$

3.1

million

per year in electric rates to fund the Energy Smart energy efficiency programs.  The rate settlement provided an incentive for Entergy New Orleans to meet or exceed energy savings targets set by the City Council and provided a mechanism for Entergy New Orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the energy savings generated from the energy efficiency programs.  In January 2015 the City Council approved funding for the Energy Smart program from April 2015 through March 2017 using the remainder of the approximately

$

12.8

million

of 2014 rough production cost equalization funds, with any remaining costs being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause.  This funding methodology was modified in November 2015 when the City Council directed Entergy New Orleans to use a combination of guaranteed customer savings related to a prior agreement with the City Council and rough production cost equalization funds to cover program costs prior to recovering any costs through the fuel adjustment clause.  In April 2017 the City Council approved an implementation plan for the Energy Smart program from April 2017 through December 2019.  The City Council directed that the

$

11.8

million

balance reported for Energy Smart funds be used to continue funding the program for Entergy New Orleans’s legacy customers and that the Energy Smart Algiers program continue to be funded through the Algiers fuel adjustment clause, until additional customer funding is required for the legacy customers.  In September 2017, Entergy New Orleans filed a supplemental plan and proposed several options for an interim cost recovery mechanism necessary to recover program costs during the period between when existing funds directed to Energy Smart programs are depleted and when new rates from the 2018 combined rate case, which includes a cost recovery mechanism for Energy Smart funding, take effect.  In December 2017 the City Council approved an energy efficiency cost recovery rider as an interim funding mechanism for Energy Smart, subject to verification that no additional funding sources exist.  In June 2018 the City Council also approved a resolution recommending that Entergy New Orleans allocate approximately

$

13.5

million

of benefits resulting from the Tax Act to Energy Smart.  In December 2019, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the City Council seeking approval of an implementation plan for the Energy Smart program from April 2020 through December 2022.  Entergy New Orleans proposed to recover the costs of the program through mechanisms previously approved by the City Council or through the energy efficiency cost recovery rider, which was approved in the 2018 combined rate case resolution.  In January 2020 the City Council’s advisors recommended that the City Council allow Entergy New Orleans to earn a utility performance incentive of


%

of Energy Smart costs for each year in which Entergy New Orleans achieves


%

of the City Council’s savings targets for Energy Smart.  The City Council is expected to decide on the matter in February 2020.

Notes to Financial Statements

In September 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed an electric and gas base rate case with the City Council. The filing requested a

10.5

%

return on equity for electric operations with opportunity to earn a

10.75

%

return on equity through a performance adder provision of the electric formula rate plan in subsequent years under a formula rate plan and requested a

10.75

%

return on equity for gas operations.  The proposed electric rates in the revised filing reflect a net reduction of

$

20.3

million

.  The reduction in electric rates includes a base rate increase of

$

135.2

million

, of which

$

131.5

million

is associated with moving costs currently collected through fuel and other riders into base rates, plus a request for an advanced metering surcharge to recover

$

7.1

million

associated with advanced metering infrastructure, offset by a net decrease of

$

31.1

million

related to fuel and other riders.  The filing also included a proposed gas rate decrease of

$


thousand

.  Entergy New Orleans’s rates reflected the inclusion of federal income tax reductions due to the Tax Act and the provisions of a previously-approved agreement in principle determining how the benefits of the Tax Act would flow.  Entergy New Orleans included cost of service studies for electric and gas operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and the projected twelve months ending December 31, 2018.  In addition, Entergy New Orleans included capital additions expected to be placed into service for the period through December 31, 2019.  Entergy New Orleans based its request for a change in rates on the projected twelve months ending December 31, 2018.

The filing’s major provisions included: (1) a new electric rate structure, which realigns the revenue requirement associated with capacity and long-term service agreement expense from certain existing riders to base revenue, provides for the recovery of the cost of advanced metering infrastructure, and partially blends rates for Entergy New Orleans’s customers residing in Algiers with customers residing in the remainder of Orleans Parish through a three-year phase-in; (2) contemporaneous cost recovery riders for investments in energy efficiency/demand response, incremental changes in capacity/long-term service agreement costs, grid modernization investment, and gas infrastructure replacement investment; and (3) formula rate plans for both electric and gas operations.  In February 2019 the City Council’s advisors and several intervenors filed testimony in response to Entergy New Orleans’s application.  The City Council’s advisors recommended, among other things, overall rate reductions of approximately

$


million

in electric rates and

$

3.8

million

in gas rates.  Certain intervenors recommended overall rate reductions of up to approximately

$


million

in electric rates and

$


million

in gas rates.  An evidentiary hearing was held in June 2019, and the record and post-hearing briefs were submitted in July 2019.

In October 2019 the City Council’s Utility Committee approved a resolution for a change in electric and gas rates for consideration by the full City Council that included a

9.35

%

return on common equity, an equity ratio of the lesser of


%

or Entergy New Orleans’s actual equity ratio, and a total reduction in revenues that Entergy New Orleans initially estimated to be approximately

$


million

(

$


million

electric;

$


million

gas).  At its November 7, 2019 meeting, the full City Council approved the resolution that had previously been approved by the City Council’s Utility Committee.  Based on the approved resolution, in the fourth quarter 2019 Entergy New Orleans recorded an accrual of

$


million

that reflects the estimate of the revenue billed in 2019 to be refunded to customers in 2020 based on an August 2019 effective date for the rate decrease.  Entergy New Orleans also recorded a total of

$


million

in regulatory assets for rate case costs and information technology costs associated with integrating Algiers customers with Entergy New Orleans’s legacy system and records.  Entergy New Orleans also transferred

$


million

of retired general plant costs to a regulatory asset to be recovered over a 20-year period.

The resolution directed Entergy New Orleans to submit a compliance filing within 30 days of the date of the resolution to facilitate the eventual implementation of rates, including all necessary calculations and conforming rate schedules and riders.  The electric formula rate plan rider includes, among other things, 1) a provision for forward-looking adjustments to include known and measurable changes realized up to 12 months after the evaluation period; 2) a decoupling mechanism; and 3) recognition that Entergy New Orleans is authorized to make an in-service adjustment to the formula rate plan to include the non-fuel cost of the New Orleans Power Station in rates, unless the two pending appeals in the New Orleans Power Station proceeding have not concluded.  Under this circumstance, Entergy New Orleans shall be permitted to defer the New Orleans Power Station non-fuel costs, including the cost of capital, until Entergy New Orleans commences non-fuel cost recovery.  After taking into account the requirements for submission of the compliance filing, the total annual revenue requirement reduction required by the resolution was refined to approximately

$


million

(

$


million

electric, including

$


million

in rider reductions;

$


million

gas).  In January



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

2020 the City Council’s advisors found that the rates calculated by Entergy New Orleans and reflected in the December 2019 compliance filing should be implemented, except with respect to the City Council-approved energy efficiency cost recovery rider, which rider calculation should take into account events to be determined by the City Council in the future.  Also in response to the resolution, Entergy New Orleans filed timely a petition for appeal and judicial review and for stay of or injunctive relief alleging that the resolution is unlawful in failing to produce just and reasonable rates.  Based on the general acceptance of Entergy New Orleans’s compliance filing, however, during the pendency of its appeal Entergy New Orleans expects to implement the compliance filing rates in April 2020.  A hearing on the requested injunction was scheduled in Civil District Court for February 2020, but by joint motion of the City Council and Entergy New Orleans, the Civil District Court issued an order for a limited remand to the City Council to consider a potential agreement in principle/stipulation at its February 20, 2020 meeting.  On February 17, 2020, Entergy New Orleans filed with the City Council an agreement in principle between Entergy New Orleans and the City Council’s advisors.  On February 20, 2020, the full City Council voted to approve the proposed agreement in principle and issued a resolution modifying the required treatment of certain accumulated deferred income taxes.  As a result of the agreement in principle, the total annual revenue requirement reduction will be approximately

$


million

(

$


million

electric, including

$


million

in rider reductions; and

$


million

gas).   As a result, Entergy New Orleans will fully implement new rates by April 2020.  The merits of the appeal will be subject to a separate procedural schedule issued by the Civil District Court.

Internal Restructuring

In July 2016, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the City Council seeking authorization to undertake a restructuring that would result in the transfer of substantially all of the assets and operations of Entergy New Orleans, Inc. to a new entity, which would ultimately be owned by an existing Entergy subsidiary holding company.  In May 2017 the City Council adopted a resolution approving the proposed internal restructuring pursuant to an agreement in principle with the City Council advisors and certain intervenors.  Pursuant to the agreement in principle, Entergy New Orleans would credit retail customers

$


million

in 2017,

$

1.4

million

in the first quarter of the year after the transaction closes, and

$

117,500

each month in the second year after the transaction closes until such time as new base rates go into effect as a result of the then-anticipated 2018 base rate case (which has subsequently been filed).  Entergy New Orleans began crediting retail customers in June 2017.  In June 2017 the FERC approved the transaction and, pursuant to the agreement in principle, Entergy New Orleans will provide additional credits to retail customers of

$


million

in each of the years 2018, 2019, and 2020.

In November 2017, Entergy New Orleans undertook a multi-step restructuring, including the following:

•

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. redeemed its outstanding preferred stock at a price of approximately

$


million

, which included a call premium of approximately

$

819,000

, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends.

•

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. converted from a Louisiana corporation to a Texas corporation.

•

Under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Entergy New Orleans, Inc. allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy New Orleans Power, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Entergy New Orleans Power), and Entergy New Orleans Power assumed substantially all of the liabilities of Entergy New Orleans, Inc., in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC.  Entergy New Orleans, Inc. remained in existence and held the membership interests in Entergy New Orleans Power.

•

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. contributed the membership interests in Entergy New Orleans Power to an affiliate (Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and subsidiary of Entergy Corporation).  As a result of the contribution, Entergy New Orleans Power is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC.

In December 2017, Entergy New Orleans, Inc. changed its name to Entergy Utility Group, Inc., and Entergy New Orleans Power then changed its name to Entergy New Orleans, LLC.  Entergy New Orleans, LLC holds substantially all of the assets, and has assumed substantially all of the liabilities, of Entergy New Orleans, Inc.  The restructuring was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control.

Filings with the PUCT and Texas Cities (Entergy Texas)

Retail Rates

2018 Base Rate Case

In May 2018, Entergy Texas filed a base rate case with the PUCT seeking an increase in base rates and rider rates of approximately

$


million

, of which

$


million

is associated with moving costs currently being collected through riders into base rates such that the total incremental revenue requirement increase is approximately

$


million

.  The base rate case was based on a 12-month test year ending December 31, 2017.  In addition, Entergy Texas included capital additions placed into service for the period of April 1, 2013 through December 31, 2017, as well as a post-test year adjustment to include capital additions placed in service by June 30, 2018.

In October 2018 the parties filed an unopposed settlement resolving all issues in the proceeding and a motion for interim rates effective for usage on and after October 17, 2018.  The unopposed settlement reflects the following terms: a base rate increase of

$

53.2

million

(net of costs realigned from riders and including updated depreciation rates), a

$


million

refund to reflect the lower federal income tax rate applicable to Entergy Texas from January 25, 2018 through the date new rates are implemented,

$


million

of capitalized skylining tree hazard costs will not be recovered from customers,

$

242.5

million

of protected excess accumulated deferred income taxes, which includes a tax gross-up, will be returned to customers through base rates under the average rate assumption method over the lives of the associated assets, and

$

185.2

million

of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes, which includes a tax gross-up, will be returned to customers through a rider.  The unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes rider will include carrying charges and will be in effect over a period of 12 months for large customers and over a period of four years for other customers.  The settlement also provides for the deferral of

$

24.5

million

of costs associated with the remaining book value of the Neches and Sabine 2 plants, previously taken out of service, to be recovered over a ten-year period and the deferral of

$

20.5

million

of costs associated with Hurricane Harvey to be recovered over a 12-year period, each beginning in October 2018.  The settlement provides final resolution of all issues in the matter, including those related to the Tax Act.  In October 2018 the ALJ granted the unopposed motion for interim rates to be effective for service rendered on or after October 17, 2018.  In December 2018 the PUCT issued an order approving the unopposed settlement.

In January 2019, Entergy Texas filed for recovery of rate case expenses totaling

$

7.2

million

.  The amounts requested primarily include internal and external expenses related to litigating the 2018 base rate case.  Parties filed testimony in April 2019 recommending a disallowance ranging from

$

3.2

million

to

$

4.2

million

of the

$

7.2

million

requested.  In May 2019, Entergy Texas filed rebuttal testimony responding to the parties’ positions.  In September 2019 an order was issued abating the procedural schedule and scheduled hearing to allow the finalization of a settlement in principle reached among the parties.  The settlement provides for a black box disallowance of

$

1.4

million

.  In the third quarter 2019, Entergy Texas recorded a provision for the 2018 base rate case expenses based on the settlement in principle.  In October 2019 the settlement was filed for review by the PUCT.  In February 2020 the PUCT approved the settlement.

Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF) Rider

In June 2017, Entergy Texas filed an application to amend its DCRF rider by increasing the total collection from

$

8.65

million

to approximately

$


million

.  In July 2017, Entergy Texas, the PUCT staff, and the two other parties in the proceeding entered into an unopposed stipulation and settlement agreement resulting in an amended DCRF annual revenue requirement of

$

18.3

million

.  In September 2017 the PUCT issued its final order approving the unopposed stipulation and settlement agreement.  The amended DCRF rider rates became effective for usage on and after September 1, 2017.  DCRF rates were set to

zero

upon implementation of new base rates on October 17, 2018, as described above in the discussion of the 2018 base rate case.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

In March 2019, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to set a new DCRF rider.  The proposed new DCRF rider is designed to collect approximately

$

3.2

million

annually from Entergy Texas’s retail customers based on its capital invested in distribution between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018.   In September 2019 the PUCT issued an order approving rates, which had been effective on an interim basis since June 2019, at the level proposed in Entergy Texas’s application.

Transmission Cost Recovery Factor (TCRF) Rider

In September 2016, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its TCRF rider.  The proposed amended TCRF rider was designed to collect approximately

$

29.5

million

annually from Entergy Texas’s retail customers.  In December 2016, concurrent with the 2016 fuel reconciliation stipulation and settlement agreement discussed above, Entergy Texas and the PUCT staff reached a settlement agreeing to the amended TCRF annual revenue requirement of

$

29.5

million

.  As discussed above, the terms of the two settlements are interdependent.  The PUCT approved the settlement and issued a final order in March 2017.  Entergy Texas implemented the amended TCRF rider beginning with bills covering usage on and after March 20, 2017.  TCRF rates were set to

zero

upon implementation of new base rates on October 17, 2018, as described above in the 2018 base rate case discussion.

In December 2018, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to set a new TCRF rider.  The proposed new TCRF rider is designed to collect approximately

$

2.7

million

annually from Entergy Texas’s retail customers based on its capital invested in transmission between January 1, 2018 and September 30, 2018.  In April 2019 parties filed testimony proposing a load growth adjustment, which would fully offset Entergy Texas’s proposed TCRF revenue requirement.  In July 2019 the PUCT granted Entergy Texas’s application as filed to begin recovery of the requested

$

2.7

million

annual revenue requirement, rejecting opposing parties’ proposed adjustment; however, the PUCT found that the question of prudence of the actual investment costs should be determined in Entergy Texas’s next rate case similar to the procedure used for the costs recovered through the DCRF rider.  In October 2019 the PUCT issued an order on a motion for rehearing, clarifying and affirming its prior order granting Entergy Texas’s application as filed.  Also in October 2019 a second motion for rehearing was filed, and Entergy Texas filed a response in opposition to the motion.  The second motion for rehearing was overruled by operation of law.  In December 2019, Texas Industrial Energy Consumers filed an appeal to the PUCT order in district court alleging that the PUCT erred in declining to apply a load growth adjustment.

In August 2019, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its TCRF rider.  The proposed new TCRF rider is designed to collect approximately

$

19.4

million

annually from Entergy Texas’s retail customers based on its capital invested in transmission between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019, which is

$

16.7

million

in incremental annual revenue above the

$

2.7

million

approved in the prior pending TCRF proceeding.  In November 2019, Entergy Texas filed an unopposed stipulation and settlement agreement providing for recovery of the requested revenue requirement.  In January 2020 the PUCT issued an order approving the unopposed settlement.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) Filings

Entergy Arkansas

In September 2016, Entergy Arkansas filed an application seeking a finding from the APSC that Entergy Arkansas’s deployment of AMI is in the public interest.  Entergy Arkansas proposed to replace existing meters with advanced meters that enable two-way data communication; design and build a secure and reliable network to support such communications; and implement support systems.  AMI is intended to serve as the foundation of Entergy Arkansas’s modernized power grid.  The filing included an estimate of implementation costs for AMI of

$


million

and identified a number of quantified and unquantified benefits.  Entergy Arkansas proposed a 15-year depreciable life for the new advanced meters, the three-year deployment of which began in January 2019.  Deployment of the communications network began in 2018.  In October 2017 the APSC issued an order finding that Entergy Arkansas’s AMI deployment is in the public interest and approving the settlement agreement subject to a minor modification.  Entergy Arkansas is recovering the AMI deployment costs and the quantified benefits through its formula rate plan.  Entergy Arkansas will



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

recover the undepreciated balance of its existing meters through a regulatory asset to be amortized over 15 years, as approved by the APSC.

Entergy Louisiana

In November 2016, Entergy Louisiana filed an application seeking a finding from the LPSC that Entergy Louisiana’s deployment of advanced electric and gas metering infrastructure is in the public interest.  Entergy Louisiana proposed to deploy advanced meters that enable two-way data communication; design and build a secure and reliable network to support such communications; and implement support systems.  AMI is intended to serve as the foundation of Entergy Louisiana’s modernized power grid.  The filing included an estimate of implementation costs for AMI of

$


million

and identified a number of quantified and unquantified benefits. Entergy Louisiana proposed a 15-year useful life for the new advanced meters, the three-year deployment of which began in 2019.  Deployment of the communications network began in 2018.  Entergy Louisiana proposed to recover the cost of AMI through the implementation of a customer charge, net of certain benefits, phased in over the period 2019 through 2022.  The parties reached an uncontested stipulation permitting implementation of Entergy Louisiana’s proposed AMI system, with modifications to the proposed customer charge.  In July 2017 the LPSC approved the stipulation.  Entergy Louisiana will recover the undepreciated balance of its existing meters through a regulatory asset to be amortized at current depreciation rates, as approved by the LPSC.

Entergy Mississippi

In November 2016, Entergy Mississippi filed an application seeking an order from the MPSC granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity and finding that Entergy Mississippi’s deployment of AMI is in the public interest.  Entergy Mississippi proposed to replace existing meters with advanced meters that enable two-way data communication; to design and build a secure and reliable network to support such communications; and to implement support systems.  AMI is intended to serve as the foundation of Entergy Mississippi’s modernized power grid.  The filing included an estimate of implementation costs for AMI of

$


million

and identified a number of quantified and unquantified benefits.  Entergy Mississippi proposed a 15-year depreciable life for the new advanced meters, the three-year deployment of which began in 2019.  Deployment of the communications network began in 2018.  Entergy Mississippi proposed to include the AMI deployment costs and the quantified benefits in existing rate mechanisms, primarily through future formula rate plan filings and/or future energy cost recovery rider schedule re-determinations, as applicable.  In May 2017 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi entered into and filed a joint stipulation supporting Entergy Mississippi’s filing, and the MPSC issued an order approving the filing without material changes, finding that Entergy Mississippi’s deployment of AMI is in the public interest and granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity.  The MPSC order also confirmed that Entergy Mississippi shall continue to include in rate base the remaining book value of existing meters that will be retired as part of the AMI deployment and also to depreciate those assets using current depreciation rates.  In June 2018, as part of the order approving the joint stipulation between the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi addressing Entergy Mississippi’s 2018 formula rate plan evaluation report and the ratemaking effects of the Tax Act, the MPSC approved the acceleration of the recovery of substantially all of Entergy Mississippi’s existing customer meters in anticipation of AMI deployment.

Entergy New Orleans

In October 2016, Entergy New Orleans filed an application seeking a finding from the City Council that Entergy New Orleans’s deployment of advanced electric and gas metering infrastructure is in the public interest.  Entergy New Orleans proposed to deploy advanced meters that enable two-way data communication; design and build a secure and reliable network to support such communications; and implement support systems.  AMI is intended to serve as the foundation of Entergy New Orleans’s modernized power grid.  The filing included an estimate of implementation costs for AMI of

$


million

and identified a number of quantified and unquantified benefits.  Entergy New Orleans proposed a 15-year depreciable life for the new advanced meters.  Deployment of the information technology infrastructure began in 2017 and deployment of the communications network began in 2018.  Entergy New Orleans proposed to



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

recover the cost of AMI through the implementation of a customer charge, net of certain benefits, phased in over the period 2019 through 2022.  The City Council’s advisors filed testimony in May 2017 recommending the adoption of AMI subject to certain modifications, including the denial of Entergy New Orleans’s proposed customer charge as a cost recovery mechanism. In January 2018 a settlement was reached between the City Council’s advisors and Entergy New Orleans.  In February 2018 the City Council approved the settlement, which deferred cost recovery to the 2018 Entergy New Orleans rate case, but also stated that an adjustment for 2018-2019 AMI costs can be filed in the rate case and that, for all subsequent AMI costs, the mechanism to be approved in the 2018 rate case will allow for the timely recovery of such costs.  In April 2018 the City Council adopted a resolution directing Entergy New Orleans to explore the options for accelerating the deployment of AMI.  In June 2018 the City Council approved a one-year acceleration of AMI in its service area for an incremental

$

4.4

million

.  Entergy New Orleans began deployment of AMI during the first quarter of 2019 and expects to complete deployment by the end of 2020.  Entergy New Orleans will recover the undepreciated balance of its existing meters through a regulatory asset to be amortized on a straight-line basis over 12 years, as approved by the City Council.

Entergy Texas

In April 2017 the Texas legislature enacted legislation that extends statutory support for AMI deployment to Entergy Texas and directs that if Entergy Texas elects to deploy AMI, it shall do so as rapidly as practicable.  In July 2017, Entergy Texas filed an application seeking an order from the PUCT approving Entergy Texas’s deployment of AMI.  Entergy Texas proposed to replace existing meters with advanced meters that enable two-way data communication; design and build a secure and reliable network to support such communications; and implement support systems.  AMI is intended to serve as the foundation of Entergy Texas’s modernized power grid.  The filing included an estimate of implementation costs for AMI of

$


million

and identified a number of quantified and unquantified benefits.  Entergy Texas proposed a seven-year depreciable life for the new advanced meters.  Entergy Texas also proposed a surcharge tariff to recover the reasonable and necessary costs it has and will incur under the deployment plan for the full deployment of advanced meters.  Further, Entergy Texas sought approval of fees that would be charged to customers who choose to opt out of receiving service through an advanced meter and instead receive electric service with a non-standard meter.  In October 2017, Entergy Texas and other parties entered into and filed an unopposed stipulation and settlement agreement permitting deployment of AMI with limited modifications.  The PUCT approved the stipulation and settlement agreement in December 2017.  Entergy Texas implemented the AMI surcharge tariff beginning with January 2018 bills.  As of December 31, 2019, Entergy Texas has a regulatory liability related to the collection of the surcharge from customers.  Consistent with the approval, deployment of the communications network began in 2018 and the three-year deployment of the advanced meters began in 2019.  Entergy Texas will recover the undepreciated balance of its existing meters through a regulatory asset to be amortized at current depreciation rates, as approved by the PUCT.

System Agreement Cost Equalization Proceedings

Prior to final termination of the System Agreement in 2016, the Utility operating companies engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of that agreement.  Entergy Arkansas terminated participation in the System Agreement in December 2013.  Entergy Mississippi terminated participation in the System Agreement in November 2015.  The System Agreement terminated with respect to the remaining participants in August 2016.

Although the System Agreement has terminated, certain of the Utility operating companies’ retail regulators continue to pursue litigation involving the System Agreement at the FERC and in federal courts.  The proceedings include challenges to the allocation of costs as defined by the System Agreement and to other matters.

In June 2005 the FERC issued a decision in System Agreement litigation that had been commenced by the LPSC, and essentially affirmed its decision in a December 2005 order on rehearing.  The decision included, among other things:



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

•

The FERC’s conclusion that the System Agreement no longer roughly equalized total production costs among the Utility operating companies.

•

In order to reach rough production cost equalization, the FERC imposed a bandwidth remedy by which each company’s total annual production costs would have to be within +/-


%

of Entergy System average total annual production costs.

•

The remedy ordered by the FERC in 2005 required no refunds and became effective based on calendar year 2006 production costs with the first reallocation payments made in 2007.

The FERC’s decision reallocated total production costs of the Utility operating companies whose relative total production costs expressed as a percentage of Entergy System average production costs are outside an upper or lower bandwidth.  This was accomplished by payments from Utility operating companies whose production costs were more than

below Entergy System average production costs to Utility operating companies whose production costs were more than the Entergy System average production cost, with payments going first to those Utility operating companies whose total production costs were farthest above the Entergy System average.

The LPSC, APSC, MPSC, and the Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers appealed the FERC’s December 2005 decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  Entergy and the City of New Orleans intervened in the various appeals.  The D.C. Circuit issued its decision in April 2008.  The D.C. Circuit concluded that the FERC’s orders had failed to adequately explain both its conclusion that it was prohibited from ordering refunds for the 20-month period from September 13, 2001 - May 2, 2003 and its determination to implement the bandwidth remedy commencing on January 1, 2006, rather than June 1, 2005.  The D.C. Circuit remanded the case to the FERC for further proceedings on those two issues.

In October 2011 the FERC issued an order addressing the D.C. Circuit remand on the two issues.  On the first issue, the FERC concluded that it did have the authority to order refunds, but decided that it would exercise its equitable discretion and not require refunds for the 20-month period from September 13, 2001 - May 2, 2003.  Because the ruling on refunds relied on findings in a separate FERC proceeding, the FERC concluded that this refund ruling would be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the rehearing requests in the other proceeding.  On the second issue, the FERC reversed its prior decision and ordered that the prospective bandwidth remedy begin on June 1, 2005 (the date of its initial order in the proceeding) rather than January 1, 2006, as it had previously ordered.  Pursuant to the October 2011 order, Entergy was required to calculate bandwidth payments for the period June - December 2005 utilizing the bandwidth formula tariff prescribed by the FERC that was filed in a December 2006 compliance filing and accepted by the FERC in an April 2007 order.

In December 2011, Entergy filed with the FERC its compliance filing that provided the payments and receipts among the Utility operating companies pursuant to the FERC’s October 2011 order.  The APSC, the LPSC, the PUCT, and other parties intervened in the December 2011 compliance filing proceeding, and the APSC and the LPSC also filed protests.

The filing showed the following payments/receipts among the Utility operating companies:

Entergy Arkansas made its payment in January 2012.  In February 2012, Entergy Arkansas filed for an interim adjustment to its production cost allocation rider requesting that the

$


million

be collected from customers over the 22-month period from March 2012 through December 2013.  In March 2012 the APSC issued an order stating that

Notes to Financial Statements

the payment can be recovered from retail customers through the production cost allocation rider, subject to refund.  The LPSC and the APSC requested rehearing of the FERC’s October 2011 order.

In February 2014 the FERC issued a rehearing order addressing its October 2011 order.  The FERC denied the LPSC’s request for rehearing on the issues of whether the bandwidth remedy should be made effective earlier than June 1, 2005, and whether refunds should be ordered for the 20-month refund effective period.  The FERC granted the LPSC’s rehearing request on the issue of interest on the bandwidth payments/receipts for the June - December 2005 period, requiring that interest be accrued from June 1, 2006 until the date those bandwidth payments/receipts are made.  Also in February 2014 the FERC issued an order rejecting the December 2011 compliance filing that calculated the bandwidth payments/receipts for the June - December 2005 period.  The FERC order required a new compliance filing that calculates the bandwidth payments/receipts for the June - December 2005 period based on monthly data for the seven individual months including interest pursuant to the February 2014 rehearing order.  Entergy sought rehearing of the February 2014 order with respect to the FERC’s determinations regarding interest.  In April 2014 the LPSC filed a petition for review of the FERC’s October 2011 and February 2014 orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  In August 2017 the D.C. Circuit issued a decision denying the LPSC’s appeal of the FERC’s October 2011 and February 2014 orders.  On the issue of the FERC’s implementation of the prospective remedy as of June 2005 and whether the bandwidth remedy should be extended for an additional 17 months in years 2004-2005, the D.C. Circuit affirmed the FERC’s implementation of the remedy and denied the LPSC’s appeal.  On the issue of whether the operating companies should be required to issue refunds for the 20-month period from September 2001 to May 2003, the D.C. Circuit granted the FERC’s request for agency reconsideration and remanded that issue back to the FERC for further proceedings as requested by all parties to the appeal.  In response to the D.C. Circuit’s remand, various parties filed briefs with the FERC addressing whether the FERC should require the Utility operating companies to issue refunds for the 20-month refund period from September 2001 to May 2003.  The LPSC argued in favor of such remands and Entergy has opposed the LPSC’s request.  In an order issued in November 2019, the FERC ruled that refunds are not appropriate for the 20-month refund period.

In April and May 2014, Entergy filed with the FERC an updated compliance filing that provided the payments and receipts among the Utility operating companies pursuant to the FERC’s February 2014 orders.

The filing showed the following net payments and receipts, including interest, among the Utility operating companies:

These payments were made in May 2014.  The LPSC, City Council, and APSC filed protests.

The hearing on the bandwidth calculation for the seven months June 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005 occurred in July 2016.  The presiding judge issued an initial decision in November 2016.   In the initial decision, the presiding judge agreed with the Utility operating companies’ position that: (1) interest on the bandwidth payments for the 2005 test period should be accrued from June 1, 2006 until the date that the bandwidth payments for that calculation are paid, which is consistent with how the Utility operating companies performed the calculation; and (2) a portion of Entergy Louisiana’s 2001-vintage Louisiana state net operating loss accumulated deferred income tax that results from the Vidalia tax deduction should be excluded from the 2005 test period bandwidth calculation.  Various participants filed briefs on exceptions or briefs opposing exceptions, or both, related to the initial decision, including the LPSC, the APSC, the FERC trial staff, and Entergy Services.  In May 2018 the FERC issued an order affirming the initial decision and ordered a comprehensive recalculation of the bandwidth payments/receipts for the seven months June 1,



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

2005 through December 31, 2005 and a recalculation of the 2006 and 2007 test years as a result of limited revisions.  Entergy filed the comprehensive recalculation of the bandwidth payments/receipts for the seven months June 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005 and the 2006 and 2007 test years in July 2018.

The filing shows the additional following payments and receipts among the Utility operating companies:

These payments were made in July 2018.  In May 2019, the FERC accepted the July 2018 compliance filing, and the LPSC sought rehearing of that decision in June 2019.  In December 2019 the FERC denied the LPSC’s request for rehearing, and the LPSC appealed the FERC’s prior orders to the D.C. Circuit in January 2020.

In the course of these proceedings the FERC rejected the APSC’s protest that Entergy Arkansas should not be subject to the 2014 compliance filing because Entergy Arkansas would be making the payments during a period following its exit from the System Agreement.  In January 2018 the D.C. Circuit affirmed the FERC decision that Entergy Arkansas was subject to the compliance filing.

Rough Production Cost Equalization Rates

Each May from 2007 through 2016 Entergy filed with the FERC the rates to implement the FERC’s orders in the System Agreement proceeding.

These filings showed the following payments/receipts among the Utility operating companies were necessary to achieve rough production cost equalization as defined by the FERC’s orders:

The Utility operating companies recorded accounts payable or accounts receivable to reflect the rough production cost equalization payments and receipts required to implement the FERC’s remedy.  When accounts payable were recorded, a corresponding regulatory asset was recorded for the right to collect the payments from customers.  When accounts receivable were recorded, a corresponding regulatory liability was recorded for the obligations to pass the receipts on to customers.  No payments were required in 2016 or 2015 to implement the FERC’s remedy based on calendar year 2015 production costs and 2014 production costs, respectively.  The System Agreement terminated in August 2016.

The APSC approved a production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to Entergy Arkansas.  Entergy Texas recovered its 2013 rough production cost equalization payment over three years beginning April 2014.  Entergy Texas included its 2014 rough production cost equalization payment as a component of an interim fuel refund made in 2014.  Management believes that any changes in the allocation of production costs resulting from the FERC’s decision and related retail proceedings should result in similar rate changes for retail customers, subject to specific circumstances that have caused trapped costs.

The following rough production cost equalization rate proceedings are still ongoing.

2011 Rate Filing Based on Calendar Year 2010 Production Costs

In May 2011, Entergy filed with the FERC the 2011 rates in accordance with the FERC’s orders in the System Agreement proceeding.  Several parties intervened in the proceeding at the FERC, including the LPSC, which also filed a protest.  In July 2011 the FERC accepted Entergy’s proposed rates for filing, effective June 1, 2011, subject to refund.  After an abeyance of the proceeding schedule, in December 2014 the FERC consolidated the 2011 rate filing with the 2012, 2013, and 2014 rate filings for settlement and hearing procedures.  See discussion below regarding the consolidated settlement and hearing procedures in connection with this proceeding.

2012 Rate Filing Based on Calendar Year 2011 Production Costs

In May 2012, Entergy filed with the FERC the 2012 rates in accordance with the FERC’s orders in the System Agreement proceeding.  Several parties intervened in the proceeding at the FERC, including the LPSC, which also filed a protest.  In August 2012 the FERC accepted Entergy’s proposed rates for filing, effective June 2012, subject to refund.  After an abeyance of the proceeding schedule, in December 2014 the FERC consolidated the 2012 rate filing with the 2011, 2013, and 2014 rate filings for settlement and hearing procedures.  See discussion below regarding the consolidated settlement and hearing procedures in connection with this proceeding.

2013 Rate Filing Based on Calendar Year 2012 Production Costs

In May 2013, Entergy filed with the FERC the 2013 rates in accordance with the FERC’s orders in the System Agreement proceeding.  Several parties intervened in the proceeding at the FERC, including the LPSC, which also filed a protest.  The City Council intervened and filed comments related to including the outcome of a related FERC proceeding in the 2013 cost equalization calculation.  In August 2013 the FERC issued an order accepting the 2013 rates, effective June 1, 2013, subject to refund.  After an abeyance of the proceeding schedule, in December 2014 the FERC consolidated the 2013 rate filing with the 2011, 2012, and 2014 rate filings for settlement and hearing procedures.  See discussion below regarding the consolidated settlement and hearing procedures in connection with this proceeding.

2014 Rate Filing Based on Calendar Year 2013 Production Costs

In May 2014, Entergy filed with the FERC the 2014 rates in accordance with the FERC’s orders in the System Agreement proceeding.  Several parties intervened in the proceeding at the FERC, including the LPSC, which also filed a protest.  The City Council intervened and filed comments.  In December 2014 the FERC issued an order accepting the 2014 rates, effective June 1, 2014, subject to refund, set the proceeding for hearing procedures, and consolidated the 2014 rate filing with the 2011, 2012, and 2013 rate filings for settlement and hearing procedures.  See discussion below regarding the consolidated settlement and hearing procedures in connection with this proceeding.

Consolidated 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 Rate Filing Proceedings

As discussed above, in December 2014 the FERC consolidated the 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 rate filings for settlement and hearing procedures.  In May 2015, Entergy filed direct testimony in the consolidated rate filings and the LPSC filed direct testimony concerning its complaint proceeding that is consolidated with the rate filings, challenging certain components of the pending bandwidth calculations for prior years.  Hearings occurred in November 2015, and the ALJ issued an initial decision in July 2016.  In the initial decision, the ALJ generally agreed with Entergy’s bandwidth calculations with one exception on the accounting related to the Waterford 3 sale/leaseback.  In March 2018 the FERC issued an order affirming the initial decision.  In April 2018 the LPSC requested rehearing of the FERC’s March 2018 order affirming the ALJ’s initial decision.

Entergy filed in May 2018 the bandwidth true-up payments and receipts for the 2011-2014 rate filings (table does not net to zero due to rounding):

These payments were made in May 2018.  The LPSC request for rehearing is pending.

Entergy Arkansas Opportunity Sales Proceeding

In June 2009 the LPSC filed a complaint requesting that the FERC determine that certain of Entergy Arkansas’s sales of electric energy to third parties: (a) violated the provisions of the System Agreement that allocated the energy generated by Entergy System resources; (b) imprudently denied the Entergy System and its ultimate consumers the benefits of low-cost Entergy System generating capacity; and (c) violated the provision of the System Agreement that prohibited sales to third parties by individual companies absent an offer of a right-of-first-refusal to other Utility operating companies.   The LPSC’s complaint challenged sales made beginning in 2002 and requested refunds.  In July 2009 the Utility operating companies filed a response to the complaint arguing among other things that the System Agreement contemplates that the Utility operating companies may make sales to third parties for their own account, subject to the requirement that those sales be included in the load (or load shape) for the applicable Utility operating company.  The FERC subsequently ordered a hearing in the proceeding.

After a hearing, the ALJ issued an initial decision in December 2010.  The ALJ found that the System Agreement allowed for Entergy Arkansas to make the sales to third parties but concluded that the sales should be accounted for in the same manner as joint account sales.  The ALJ concluded that “shareholders” should make refunds of the damages to the Utility operating companies, along with interest.  Entergy disagreed with several aspects of the ALJ’s initial decision and in January 2011 filed with the FERC exceptions to the decision.

The FERC issued a decision in June 2012 and held that, while the System Agreement is ambiguous, it does provide authority for individual Utility operating companies to make opportunity sales for their own account and Entergy Arkansas made and priced these sales in good faith.  The FERC found, however, that the System Agreement does not provide authority for an individual Utility operating company to allocate the energy associated with such opportunity sales as part of its load but provides a different allocation authority.  The FERC further found that the after-the-fact accounting methodology used to allocate the energy used to supply the sales was inconsistent with the System Agreement.  The FERC in its decision established further hearing procedures to quantify the effect of repricing the opportunity sales in accordance with the FERC’s June 2012 decision.  The hearing was held in May 2013 and the ALJ issued an initial decision in August 2013.  The LPSC, the APSC, the City Council, and FERC staff filed briefs on exceptions and/or briefs opposing exceptions.  Entergy filed a brief on exceptions requesting that the FERC reverse the initial decision and a brief opposing certain exceptions taken by the LPSC and FERC staff.

In April 2016 the FERC issued orders addressing requests for rehearing filed in July 2012 and the ALJ’s August 2013 initial decision.  The first order denied Entergy’s request for rehearing and affirmed the FERC’s earlier rulings that Entergy’s original methodology for allocating energy costs to the opportunity sales was incorrect and, as a result, Entergy Arkansas must make payments to the other Utility operating companies to put them in the same position that they would have been in absent the incorrect allocation.  The FERC clarified that interest should be included with the payments.  The second order affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the rulings in the ALJ’s August 2013 initial decision regarding the methodology that should be used to calculate the payments Entergy Arkansas is to make to the other Utility operating companies.  The FERC affirmed the ALJ’s ruling that a full re-run of intra-system bills should be performed but required that methodology be modified so that the sales have the same priority for purposes of energy

allocation as joint account sales.  The FERC reversed the ALJ’s decision that any payments by Entergy Arkansas should be reduced by


%

.  The FERC also reversed the ALJ’s decision that adjustments to other System Agreement service schedules and excess bandwidth payments should not be taken into account when calculating the payments to be made by Entergy Arkansas.  The FERC held that such adjustments and excess bandwidth payments should be taken into account but ordered further proceedings before an ALJ to address whether a cap on any reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and to implement the other adjustments to the calculation methodology.

In May 2016, Entergy Services filed a request for rehearing of the FERC’s April 2016 order arguing that payments made by Entergy Arkansas should be reduced as a result of the timing of the LPSC’s approval of certain contracts.  Entergy Services also filed a request for clarification and/or rehearing of the FERC’s April 2016 order addressing the ALJ’s August 2013 initial decision.  The APSC and the LPSC also filed requests for rehearing of the FERC’s April 2016 order.

In September 2017 the FERC issued an order denying the request for rehearing on the issue of whether any payments by Entergy Arkansas to the other Utility operating companies should be reduced due to the timing of the LPSC’s approval of Entergy Arkansas’s wholesale baseload contract with Entergy Louisiana.  In November 2017 the FERC issued an order denying all of the remaining requests for rehearing of the April 2016 order.  In November 2017, Entergy Services filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit of the FERC’s orders in the first two phases of the opportunity sales case.  In December 2017 the D.C. Circuit granted Entergy Services’ request to hold the appeal in abeyance pending final resolution of the related proceeding before the FERC.  In January 2018 the APSC and the LPSC filed separate petitions for review in the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit consolidated the appeals with Entergy Services’ appeal and held all of the appeals in abeyance pending final resolution of the related proceeding before the FERC.

The hearing required by the FERC’s April 2016 order was held in May 2017.  In July 2017 the ALJ issued an initial decision addressing whether a cap on any reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and whether to implement the other adjustments to the calculation methodology.  In August 2017 the Utility operating companies, the LPSC, the APSC, and FERC staff filed individual briefs on exceptions challenging various aspects of the initial decision.  In September 2017 the Utility operating companies, the LPSC, the APSC, the MPSC, the City Council, and FERC staff filed separate briefs opposing exceptions taken by various parties.

Based on testimony previously submitted in the case and its assessment of the April 2016 FERC orders, in the first quarter 2016, Entergy Arkansas recorded a liability of

$


million

, which included interest, for its estimated increased costs and payment to the other Utility operating companies, and a deferred fuel regulatory asset of

$


million

.  Following its assessment of the course of the proceedings, including the FERC’s denial of rehearing in November 2017 described above, in the fourth quarter 2017, Entergy Arkansas recorded an additional liability of

$


million

and a regulatory asset of

$


million

.

In October 2018 the FERC issued an order addressing the ALJ’s July 2017 initial decision.  The FERC reversed the ALJ’s decision to cap the reduction in Entergy Arkansas’s payment to account for the increased bandwidth payments that Entergy Arkansas made to the other operating companies.  The FERC also reversed the ALJ’s decision that Grand Gulf sales from January through September 2000 should be included in the calculation of Entergy Arkansas’s payment.  The FERC affirmed on other grounds the ALJ’s rejection of the LPSC’s claim that certain joint account sales should be accounted for as part of the calculation of Entergy Arkansas’s payment.  In November 2018 the LPSC requested rehearing of the FERC’s October 2018 decision.  In December 2019 the FERC denied the LPSC’s request for rehearing.

In December 2018, Entergy made a compliance filing in response to the FERC’s October 2018 order.  The compliance filing provided a final calculation of Entergy Arkansas’s payments to the other Utility operating companies, including interest.   No protests were filed in response to the December 2018 compliance filing.  The December 2018 compliance filing is pending FERC action.

Refunds and interest in the following amounts were paid by Entergy Arkansas to the other operating companies in December 2018:



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

Entergy Arkansas previously recognized a regulatory asset with a balance of

$


million

as of December 31, 2018 for a portion of the payments due as a result of this proceeding.

In February 2019 the LPSC filed a new complaint relating to two issues that were raised in the opportunity sales proceeding, but that, in its October 2018 order, the FERC held were outside the scope of the proceeding.  In March 2019, Entergy Services filed an answer and motion to dismiss the new complaint.  In November 2019 the FERC issued an order denying the LPSC’s complaint.  The order concluded that the settlement agreement approved by FERC in December 2015 terminating the System Agreement barred the LPSC’s new complaint.

In May 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed an application and supporting testimony with the APSC requesting approval of a special rider tariff to recover the costs of these payments from its retail customers over a 24-month period.  The application requested that the APSC approve the rider to take effect within 30 days or, if suspended by the APSC as allowed by commission rule, approve the rider to take effect in the first billing cycle of the first month occurring 30 days after issuance of the APSC’s order approving the rider.  In June 2019 the APSC suspended Entergy Arkansas’s tariff and granted Entergy Arkansas’s motion asking the APSC to establish the proceeding as the single designated proceeding in which interested parties may assert claims related to the appropriate retail rate treatment of the FERC’s October 2018 order and related FERC orders in the opportunity sales proceeding.  In January 2020 the APSC adopted a procedural schedule with a hearing in April 2020.  In January 2020 the Attorney General and Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. filed a joint motion seeking to dismiss Entergy Arkansas’s application alleging that the APSC, in a prior proceeding, ruled on the issues addressed in the application and determined that Entergy Arkansas’s requested relief violates the filed rate doctrine and the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking.  Entergy Arkansas responded to the joint motion in February 2020 rebutting these arguments, including demonstrating that the claims in this proceeding differ substantially from those the APSC addressed previously and that the payment resulting from a FERC tariff violation for which Entergy Arkansas seeks retail cost recovery in this proceeding differs materially from the refunds resulting from a FERC tariff amendment that the APSC previously rejected on filed rate doctrine and the retroactive ratemaking grounds.  In addition, in January 2020 the Attorney General and Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. filed testimony opposing the recovery by Entergy Arkansas of the opportunity sales payment but also claiming that certain components of the payment should be segregated and refunded to customers.

Complaints Against System Energy

Return on Equity and Capital Structure Complaints

In January 2017 the APSC and MPSC filed a complaint with the FERC against System Energy.  The complaint seeks a reduction in the return on equity component of the Unit Power Sales Agreement pursuant to which System Energy sells its Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.  Entergy Arkansas also sells some of its Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under separate agreements.  The current return on equity under the Unit Power Sales Agreement is

10.94

%

, which was established in a rate proceeding that became final in July 2001.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

The APSC and MPSC complaint alleges that the return on equity is unjust and unreasonable because capital market and other considerations indicate that it is excessive.  The complaint requests the FERC to institute proceedings to investigate the return on equity and establish a lower return on equity, and also requests that the FERC establish January 23, 2017 as a refund effective date.  The complaint includes return on equity analysis that purports to establish that the range of reasonable return on equity for System Energy is between

8.37

%

and

8.67

%

.  System Energy answered the complaint in February 2017 and disputes that a return on equity of

8.37

%

to

8.67

%

is just and reasonable.  The LPSC and the City Council intervened in the proceeding expressing support for the complaint.  System Energy is recording a provision against revenue for the potential outcome of this proceeding.  In September 2017 the FERC established a refund effective date of January 23, 2017 and directed the parties to engage in settlement proceedings before an ALJ.  The parties have been unable to settle the return on equity issue and a FERC hearing judge was assigned in July 2018.  The 15-month refund period in connection with the APSC/MPSC complaint expired on April 23, 2018.

In April 2018 the LPSC filed a complaint with the FERC against System Energy seeking an additional 15-month refund period.  The LPSC complaint requests similar relief from the FERC with respect to System Energy’s return on equity and also requests the FERC to investigate System Energy’s capital structure.  The APSC, MPSC, and City Council intervened in the proceeding, filed an answer expressing support for the complaint, and asked the FERC to consolidate this proceeding with the proceeding initiated by the complaint of the APSC and MPSC in January 2017.  System Energy answered the LPSC complaint in May 2018 and also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.  The 15-month refund period in connection with the LPSC return on equity complaint expired on July 26, 2019.

In August 2018 the FERC issued an order dismissing the LPSC’s request to investigate System Energy’s capital structure and setting for hearing the return on equity complaint, with a refund effective date of April 27, 2018.  The portion of the LPSC’s complaint dealing with return on equity was subsequently consolidated with the APSC and MPSC complaint for hearing.  The parties are required to address an order (issued in a separate proceeding involving New England transmission owners) that proposed modifying the FERC’s standard methodology for determining return on equity.  In September 2018, System Energy filed a request for rehearing and the LPSC filed a request for rehearing or reconsideration of the FERC’s August 2018 order.  The LPSC’s request referenced an amended complaint that it filed on the same day raising the same capital structure claim the FERC had earlier dismissed.  The FERC initiated a new proceeding for the amended capital structure complaint, and System Energy submitted a response in October 2018.  In January 2019 the FERC set the amended complaint for settlement and hearing proceedings.  Settlement proceedings in the capital structure proceeding commenced in February 2019.  As noted below, in June 2019 settlement discussions were terminated and the amended capital structure complaint was consolidated with the ongoing return on equity proceeding.  The 15-month refund period in connection with the capital structure complaint is from September 24, 2018 to December 23, 2019.

In January 2019 the LPSC and the APSC and MPSC filed direct testimony in the return on equity proceeding.  For the refund period January 23, 2017 through April 23, 2018, the LPSC argues for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

7.81

%

and the APSC and MPSC argue for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

8.24

%

.  For the refund period April 27, 2018 through July 27, 2019, and for application on a prospective basis, the LPSC argues for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

7.97

%

and the APSC and MPSC argue for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

8.41

%

. In March 2019, System Energy submitted answering testimony in the return on equity proceeding.  For the first refund period, System Energy’s testimony argues for a return on equity of

10.10

%

(median) or

10.70

%

(midpoint).  For the second refund period, System Energy’s testimony shows that the calculated returns on equity for the first period fall within the range of presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity, and thus the second complaint should be dismissed (and the first period return on equity used going forward). If the FERC nonetheless were to set a new return on equity for the second period (and going forward), System Energy argues the return on equity should be either

10.32

%

(median) or

10.69

%

(midpoint).

In May 2019 the FERC trial staff filed its direct and answering testimony in the return on equity proceeding.  For the first refund period, the FERC trial staff calculates an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

9.89

%

based on the application of FERC’s proposed methodology.  The FERC trial staff’s direct and answering testimony noted that an authorized return on equity of

9.89

%

for the first refund period was within the range of presumptively



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

just and reasonable returns on equity for the second refund period, as calculated using a study period ending January 31, 2019 for the second refund period.

In June 2019, System Entergy filed testimony responding to the testimony filed by the FERC trial staff.  Among other things, System Energy’s testimony rebutted arguments raised by the FERC trial staff and provided updated calculations for the second refund period based on the study period ending May 31, 2019.  For that refund period, System Energy’s testimony shows that strict application of the return on equity methodology proposed by the FERC staff indicates that the second complaint would not be dismissed, and the new return on equity would be set at

9.65

%

(median) or

9.74

%

(midpoint).  System Energy’s testimony argues that these results are insufficient in light of benchmarks such as state returns on equity and treasury bond yields, and instead proposes that the calculated returns on equity for the second period should be either

9.91

%

(median) or

10.3

%

(midpoint).  System Energy’s testimony also argues that, under application of its proposed modified methodology, the

10.10

%

return on equity calculated for the first refund period would fall within the range of presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity for the second refund period.  System Energy is recording a provision against revenue for the potential outcome of this proceeding.

Also in June 2019, the FERC’s Chief ALJ issued an order terminating settlement discussions in the amended complaint addressing System Energy’s capital structure.  The ALJ consolidated the amended capital structure complaint with the ongoing return on equity proceeding and set new procedural deadlines for the consolidated hearing.

In August 2019 the LPSC and the APSC and MPSC filed rebuttal testimony in the return on equity proceeding and direct and answering testimony relating to System Energy’s capital structure.  The LPSC re-argues for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

7.81

%

for the first refund period and

7.97

%

for the second refund period.  The APSC and MPSC argue for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

8.26

%

for the first refund period and

8.32

%

for the second refund period.  With respect to capital structure, the LPSC proposes that the FERC establish a hypothetical capital structure for System Energy for ratemaking purposes.  Specifically, the LPSC proposes that System Energy’s common equity ratio be set to Entergy Corporation’s equity ratio of


%

equity and


%

debt.  In the alternative, the LPSC argues that the equity ratio should be no higher than


%

, the composite equity ratio of System Energy and the other Entergy operating companies who purchase under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  The APSC and MPSC recommend that

35.98

%

be set as the common equity ratio for System Energy.  As an alternative, the APSC and MPSC propose that System Energy’s common equity be set at

46.75

%

based on the median equity ratio of the proxy group for setting the return on equity.

In September 2019 the FERC trial staff filed its rebuttal testimony in the return on equity proceeding.  For the first refund period, the FERC trial staff calculates an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

9.40

%

based on the application of the FERC’s proposed methodology and an updated proxy group.  For the second refund period, based on the study period ending May 31, 2019, the FERC trial staff rebuttal testimony argues for a return on equity of

9.63

%

.  In September 2019 the FERC trial staff also filed direct and answering testimony relating to System Energy’s capital structure.  The FERC trial staff argues that the average capital structure of the proxy group used to develop System Energy’s return on equity should be used to establish the capital structure. Using this approach, the FERC trial staff calculates the average capital structure for its proposed proxy group of

46.74

%

common equity, and

53.26

%

debt.

In October 2019, System Energy filed answering testimony disputing the FERC trial staff’s, the LPSC’s, and the APSC’s and MPSC’s arguments for the use of a hypothetical capital structure and arguing that the use of System Energy’s actual capital structure is just and reasonable.

In November 2019, in a proceeding that did not involve Entergy, the FERC issued an order addressing the methodology for determining the return on equity applicable to transmission owners in MISO.  Thereafter, the participants in the System Energy proceeding agreed to amend the procedural schedule to allow the participants to file testimony addressing the order in the MISO transmission owner proceeding.  Under the new schedule, the hearing in the System Energy proceeding will commence in June 2020 and the initial decision will be due in October 2020.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

Grand Gulf Sale-leaseback Renewal Complaint

In May 2018 the LPSC filed a complaint against System Energy and Entergy Services related to System Energy’s renewal of a sale-leaseback transaction originally entered into in December 1988 for an

11.5

%

undivided interest in Grand Gulf Unit 1.  The complaint alleges that System Energy violated the filed rate and the FERC’s ratemaking and accounting requirements when it included in Unit Power Sales Agreement billings the cost of capital additions associated with the sale-leaseback interest, and that System Energy is double-recovering costs by including both the lease payments and the capital additions in Unit Power Sales Agreement billings.  The complaint also claims that System Energy was imprudent in entering into the sale-leaseback renewal because the Utility operating companies that purchase Grand Gulf’s output from System Energy could have obtained cheaper capacity and energy in the MISO markets.  The complaint further alleges that System Energy violated various other reporting and accounting requirements and should have sought prior FERC approval of the lease renewal.  The complaint seeks various forms of relief from the FERC.  The complaint seeks refunds for capital addition costs for all years in which they were recorded in allegedly non-formula accounts or, alternatively, the disallowance of the return on equity for the capital additions in those years plus interest.  The complaint also asks that the FERC disallow and refund the lease costs of the sale-leaseback renewal on grounds of imprudence, investigate System Energy’s treatment of a DOE litigation payment, and impose certain forward-looking procedural protections, including audit rights for retail regulators of the Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rates.  The APSC, MPSC, and City Council intervened in the proceeding.

In June 2018, System Energy and Entergy Services filed a motion to dismiss and an answer to the LPSC complaint denying that System Energy’s treatment of the sale-leaseback renewal and capital additions violated the terms of the filed rate or any other FERC ratemaking, accounting, or legal requirements or otherwise constituted double recovery.  The response also argued that the complaint is inconsistent with a FERC-approved settlement to which the LPSC is a party and that explicitly authorizes System Energy to recover its lease payments.  Finally, the response argued that both the capital additions and the sale-leaseback renewal were prudent investments and the LPSC complaint fails to justify any disallowance or refunds.  The response also offered to submit formula rate protocols for the Unit Power Sales Agreement similar to the procedures used for reviewing transmission rates under the MISO tariff.  In September 2018 the FERC issued an order setting the complaint for hearing and settlement proceedings.  The FERC established a refund effective date of May 18, 2018.

In February 2019 the presiding ALJ ruled that the hearing ordered by the FERC includes the issue of whether specific subcategories of accumulated deferred income tax should be included in, or excluded from, System Energy’s formula rate.   In March 2019 the LPSC, MPSC, APSC and City Council filed direct testimony.  The LPSC testimony seeks refunds that include the renewal lease payments (approximately

$

17.2

million

per year since July 2015), rate base reductions for accumulated deferred income tax associated with uncertain tax positions (claimed to be approximately

$

334.5

million

as of December 2018), and the cost of capital additions associated with the sale-leaseback interest (claimed to be approximately

$

274.8

million

), as well as interest on those amounts.  The direct testimony of the City Council and the APSC and MPSC address various issues raised by the LPSC.  System Energy disputes that any refunds are owed for billings under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.

In June 2019 System Energy filed answering testimony in the sale-leaseback complaint proceeding arguing that the FERC should reject all claims for refunds.  Among other things, System Energy argued that claims for refunds of the costs of lease renewal payments and capital additions should be rejected because those costs were recovered consistent with the Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rate, System Energy was not over or double recovering any costs, and ratepayers will save approximately

$


million

over initial and renewal terms of the leases.  System Energy argued that claims for refunds associated with liabilities arising from uncertain tax positions should be rejected because the liabilities do not provide cost-free capital, the repayment timing of the liabilities is uncertain, and the outcome of the underlying tax positions is uncertain.  System Energy’s testimony also challenged the refund calculations supplied by the other parties.

In August 2019 the FERC trial staff filed direct and answering testimony seeking refunds for rate base reductions for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions (claimed to be up to approximately

$


million

plus interest).



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

The FERC trial staff also argued that System Energy recovered

$


million

more than it should have in depreciation expense for capital additions.  In September 2019, System Energy filed cross-answering testimony disputing the FERC trial staff’s arguments for refunds, stating that the FERC trial staff’s position regarding depreciation rates for capital additions is not unreasonable and explaining that any change in depreciation expense is only one element of a Unit Power Sales Agreement rebilling calculation.  Adjustments to depreciation expense in any rebilling under the Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rate will also involve changes to accumulated depreciation, accumulated deferred income taxes, and other formula elements as needed.  In October 2019 the LPSC filed rebuttal testimony increasing the amount of refunds sought for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.  The LPSC now seeks approximately

$


million

plus interest.  At the same time, the FERC trial staff filed rebuttal testimony conceding that it was no longer seeking up to

$


million

related to the uncertain tax positions; instead, it is seeking approximately

$


million

plus interest.  The LPSC also argued that adjustments to depreciation rates should affect rate base on a prospective basis only.

A hearing was held before a FERC ALJ in November 2019 and the initial decision is due in April 2020.

Unit Power Sales Agreement

In August 2017, System Energy submitted to the FERC proposed amendments to the Unit Power Sales Agreement pursuant to which System Energy sells its Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.  The filing proposes limited amendments to the Unit Power Sales Agreement to adopt (1) updated rates for use in calculating Grand Gulf plant depreciation and amortization expenses and (2) updated nuclear decommissioning cost annual revenue requirements, both of which are recovered through the Unit Power Sales Agreement rate formula.  The amendments result in lower charges to the Utility operating companies that buy capacity and energy from System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  The changes were based on updated depreciation and nuclear decommissioning studies that take into account the renewal of Grand Gulf’s operating license for a term through November 1, 2044.

In September 2017 the FERC accepted System Energy’s proposed Unit Power Sales Agreement amendments, subject to further proceedings to consider the justness and reasonableness of the amendments.  Because the amendments propose a rate decrease, the FERC also initiated an investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to determine if the rate decrease should be lower than proposed.  The FERC accepted the proposed amendments effective October 1, 2017, subject to refund pending the outcome of the further settlement and/or hearing proceedings, and established a refund effective date of October 11, 2017 with respect to the rate decrease.  In June 2018, System Energy filed with the FERC an uncontested settlement relating to the updated depreciation rates and nuclear decommissioning cost annual revenue requirements.  In August 2018 the FERC issued an order accepting the settlement.  In the third quarter 2018, System Energy recorded a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately

$


million

, representing the cumulative difference in depreciation expense resulting from the depreciation rates used from October 11, 2017 through September 30, 2018 and the depreciation rates included in the settlement filing accepted by the FERC.

Storm Cost Recovery Filings with Retail Regulators

Entergy Louisiana

Hurricane Isaac

In August 2012, Hurricane Isaac caused extensive damage to Entergy Louisiana’s service area.  The storm resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage primarily to distribution infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages.  In June 2014 the LPSC authorized Entergy Louisiana to utilize Louisiana Act 55 financing for Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs.  Entergy Louisiana committed to pass on to customers a minimum of

$

30.8

million

of customer benefits through annual customer credits of approximately

$

6.2

million

for five years.  Approvals for the Act 55 financings were obtained from the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC) and the Louisiana State Bond Commission.

.

Entergy and Entergy Louisiana do not report the bonds issued by the LCDA on their balance sheets because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA and there is no recourse against Entergy or Entergy Louisiana in the event of a bond default.  To service the bonds, Entergy Louisiana collects a system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee.  Entergy and Entergy Louisiana do not report the collections as revenue because Entergy Louisiana is merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the state.

Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike

In September 2008, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike caused catastrophic damage to Entergy Louisiana’s service territory.  In December 2009, Entergy Louisiana entered into a stipulation agreement with the LPSC staff regarding its storm costs.  In March and April 2010, Entergy Louisiana and other parties to the proceeding filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that included Entergy Louisiana’s proposal to utilize Act 55 financing, which included a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of

$

43.3

million

of customer benefits through a prospective annual rate reduction of

$

8.7

million

for five years.  In April 2010 the LPSC approved the settlement and subsequently issued financing orders and a ratemaking order intended to facilitate the implementation of the Act 55 financings.  In June 2010 the Louisiana State Bond Commission approved the Act 55 financing.  The settlement agreement allowed for an adjustment to the credits if there was a change in the applicable federal or state income tax rate.  As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in December 2017, and the lowering of the federal corporate income tax rate from

Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita

In August and September 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused catastrophic damage to Entergy Louisiana’s service territory.  In March 2008, Entergy Louisiana and the LURC filed at the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant a financing order authorizing the financing of Entergy Louisiana storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Louisiana Act 55.  Entergy Louisiana also filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the mechanism to flow charges and savings to customers via a storm cost offset rider.  In April 2008 the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority (LPFA), which is the issuer of the bonds pursuant to the Act 55 financing, approved requests for the Act 55 financing.  Also in April 2008, Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that included Entergy Louisiana’s proposal under the Act 55 financing, which included a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of

$

for five years.  The LPSC subsequently approved the settlement and issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to facilitate implementation of the Act 55 financing.  In May 2008 the Louisiana State Bond Commission granted final approval of the Act 55 financing.    The settlement agreement allowed for an adjustment to the credits if there was a change in the applicable federal or state income tax rate.  As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in December 2017, and the lowering of the federal corporate income tax rate from

.  As of July 31, 2017, the balance in Entergy Mississippi’s accumulated storm damage provision was less than

$


million

, therefore Entergy Mississippi resumed billing the monthly storm damage provision effective with September 2017 bills.  As of June 30, 2018, Entergy Mississippi’s storm damage provision balance exceeded

Entergy New Orleans

In August 2012, Hurricane Isaac caused extensive damage to Entergy New Orleans’s service area.  In January 2015 the City Council issued a resolution approving the terms of a joint agreement in principle filed by Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Louisiana, and the City Council Advisors determining, among other things, that Entergy New Orleans’s prudently-incurred storm recovery costs were

$

49.3

million

, of which

$

31.7

million

, net of reimbursements from the storm reserve escrow account, remained recoverable from Entergy New Orleans’s electric customers.  The resolution also directed Entergy New Orleans to file an application to securitize the unrecovered City Council-approved storm recovery costs of

$

31.7

million

pursuant to the Louisiana Electric Utility Storm Recovery Securitization Act (Louisiana Act 64).  In addition, the resolution found that it was reasonable for Entergy New Orleans to include in the principal amount of its potential securitization the costs to fund and replenish Entergy New Orleans’s storm reserve in an amount that achieved the City Council-approved funding level of

$


million

.  In January 2015, in compliance with that directive, Entergy New Orleans filed with the City Council an application requesting that the City Council grant a financing order authorizing the financing of Entergy New Orleans’s storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Louisiana Act 64.  In May 2015 the parties entered into an agreement in principle and the City Council issued a financing order authorizing Entergy New Orleans to issue storm recovery bonds in the aggregate amount of

$

98.7

million

, including

$

31.8

million

for recovery of Entergy New Orleans’s Hurricane Isaac storm recovery costs, including carrying costs,

$

63.9

to fund and replenish Entergy New Orleans’s storm reserve, and approximately

$

for estimated up-front financing costs associated with the securitization.  See Note 5 to the financial statements for discussion of the issuance of the securitization bonds in July 2015.

New Nuclear Generation Development Costs

Entergy Louisiana

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana were developing a project option for new nuclear generation at River Bend.  In March 2010, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC seeking approval to continue the limited development activities necessary to preserve an option to construct a new unit at River Bend.  At its June 2012 meeting the LPSC voted to uphold an ALJ recommendation that the request of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana be declined on the basis that the LPSC’s rule on new nuclear development does not apply to activities to preserve an option to develop and on the further grounds that the companies improperly engaged in advanced preparation activities prior to certification.  The LPSC directed that Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana be permitted to seek recovery of these costs in their upcoming rate case filings that were subsequently filed in February 2013.  In the resolution of the rate case proceeding the LPSC provided for an eight-year amortization of costs incurred in connection with the potential development of new nuclear generation at River Bend, without carrying costs, beginning in December 2014, provided, however, that amortization of these costs shall not result in a future rate increase.  As of December 31, 2019, Entergy Louisiana has a regulatory asset of

$

21.2

million

on its balance sheet related to these new nuclear generation development costs.

Notes to Financial Statements

As a result of the accounting for uncertain tax positions, the amount of the deferred tax assets reflected in the financial statements is less than the amount of the tax effect of the federal and state net operating loss carryovers, tax credit carryovers, and other tax attributes reflected on income tax returns.  Entergy evaluates the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character will be generated to realize the benefits of existing deferred tax assets. When the evaluation indicates that Entergy will not be able to realize the existing benefits, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the realizable amount.

Because it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss and other deferred tax assets will not be utilized, valuation allowances totaling

Accounting standards establish a “more-likely-than-not” recognition threshold that must be met before a tax benefit can be recognized in the financial statements.  If a tax deduction is taken on a tax return but does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, an increase in income tax liability, above what is payable on the tax return, is required to be recorded.

Income Tax Audits

Entergy and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal and various state and foreign income tax returns.  IRS examinations are complete for years before 2014.  All state taxing authorities’ examinations are complete for years before 2015. Entergy regularly negotiates with the IRS to achieve settlements.  The resolution of audit issues could result in significant changes to the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months.

2012-2013 IRS Audit

The IRS completed its examination of the 2012 and 2013 tax years and issued its 2012-2013 Revenue Agent Report (RAR) in June 2018.  Entergy agreed to all proposed adjustments contained in the RAR.  Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries recorded the effects of these adjustments in June 2018.

As a result of the issuance of the RAR, Entergy Louisiana was able to recognize previously unrecognized tax benefits of

$


million

related to the Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita contingent sharing obligation associated with the Louisiana Act 55 financing.

2014-2015 IRS Audit

The IRS is examining the 2014 and 2015 tax years.  Entergy expects the IRS to complete this examination in 2020.  As of December 31, 2019, Entergy has not received any proposed adjustments to taxable income from the IRS.

Other Tax Matters

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

Deferred tax liabilities and assets have been adjusted for the effect of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act), signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017.  The most significant effect of the Act for Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries was the change in the federal corporate income tax rate from


%

to


%

, effective January 1, 2018.  Other significant provisions and their effect on Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries are summarized below.

The Act limits the deduction for net business interest expense to 30 percent of adjusted taxable income which is similar to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The limitation does not apply to interest expense that is properly allocable to a trade or business that furnishes or sells electrical energy, gas, or steam through a local distribution system, or transports gas or steam by pipeline if the rates for such furnishing or sale are subject to ratemaking by a government entity or instrumentality or by a public utility commission.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

The IRS issued proposed regulations relating to this limitation in November 2018.  The regulations are generally proposed to be effective for taxable years ending after the date Treasury adopts the regulations as final.  Taxpayers may apply the rules of the proposed regulations to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, so long as taxpayers consistently apply the rules of the proposed regulations.  The proposed regulations provide guidance that if 90% of a tax group’s consolidated assets consist of utility property, the entire consolidated tax group will be treated as a regulated public utility and all of the consolidated group’s interest expense will be currently tax deductible.

As a result of the limitation under the Act, Entergy recorded limitations in 2018 and 2019 and recorded a deferred tax asset on the nondeductible portion, as it has an unlimited carryover period.  Entergy recorded a valuation allowance of

$


million

due to a lack of earnings from sources other than the Utility.

The Act limits the net operating loss (NOL) deduction for a given year to


%

of taxable income, effective with respect to losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.  Only NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 are subject to the


%

limitation.  Prior law generally provided a two-year carryback and 20-year carryforward for NOLs.  The Act does not allow a carryback period but does provide for the indefinite carryforward of NOLs arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017.  Because of the indefinite carryforward, the new limitations on NOL utilization are not expected to have a material effect on Entergy or the Registrant Subsidiaries.

The Act also modified Internal Revenue Code section 162(m), which limits the deduction for compensation with respect to certain covered employees to no more than

$


million

per year.  The IRS issued proposed regulations relating to this limitation in December 2019. The significant provisions of the Act and associated proposed regulations require inclusion of performance-based compensation and an expanded definition of “covered employees” in the annual computation of the section 162 limitation. The Act amendments and associated proposed regulations resulted in an increase in disallowed compensation expense, but this limitation does not have a material effect on Entergy or the Registrant Subsidiaries.

With respect to the federal corporate income tax rate change from


%

to


%

, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries recorded a regulatory liability associated with the decrease in the net accumulated deferred income tax liability, which is often referred to as “excess ADIT,” a significant portion of which has been paid to customers in 2018 and 2019 in the form of lower rates.  Entergy’s December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 balance sheets reflect a regulatory liability of

$

1.7

billion

and

$

2.1

billion

, respectively, as a result of the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities from the income tax rate change, amortization of excess ADIT, and payments to customers during 2018 and 2019.  Entergy’s regulatory liability for income taxes includes a gross-up at the applicable tax rate because of the effect that excess ADIT has on the ratemaking formula.  The regulatory liability for income taxes includes the effect of a) the reduction of the net deferred tax liability resulting in excess ADIT, b) the tax gross-up of excess ADIT, and c) the effect of the new tax rate on the previous net regulatory asset for income taxes.

For the same reasons, the Registrant Subsidiaries’ December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 balance sheets reflect net regulatory liabilities for income taxes as follows:

Excess ADIT is generally classified into two categories: 1) the portion that is subject to the normalization requirements of the Act, i.e., “protected”, and 2) the portion that is not subject to such normalization provisions, referred to as “unprotected”.  The Act provides that the normalization method of accounting for income taxes is required for



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

excess ADIT associated with public utility property.  The Act provides for the use of the average rate assumption method (ARAM) for the determination of the timing of the return of excess ADIT associated with such property.  Under ARAM, the excess ADIT is reduced over the remaining life of the asset.  Remaining asset lives vary for each Registrant Subsidiary, but the average life of public utility property is typically 30 years or longer.  Entergy will amortize the protected portion of the excess ADIT in conformity with the normalization requirements.  The Registrant Subsidiaries’ net regulatory liability for income taxes as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, includes protected excess ADIT as follows:

During the second quarter of 2018, the Registrant Subsidiaries began paying unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes, associated with the effects of the Act, to their customers through rate riders and other means approved by their respective regulatory commissions.  Payment of the unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes results in a reduction in the regulatory liability for income taxes and a corresponding reduction in income tax expense.  This has a significant effect on the effective tax rate for the period as compared to the statutory tax rate.  The Registrant Subsidiaries’ net regulatory liability for income taxes as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, includes unprotected excess ADIT as follows:

The return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes reduced Entergy’s and the Registrant Subsidiaries’ regulatory liability for income taxes as follows for 2019 and 2018:

In addition to the protected and unprotected excess ADIT amounts, the net regulatory liability for income taxes includes other regulatory assets and liabilities for income taxes associated with AFUDC, which is described in Note 1 to the financial statements.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

For a discussion of the proceedings commenced or other responses by Entergy’s regulators to the Act, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

Not all of Entergy’s excess ADIT is included in ratemaking.  Consequently, Entergy recorded a net decrease in deferred tax assets of

$


million

for which there was a corresponding charge to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017.  The corresponding income tax expense (or benefit) recorded by the Registrant Subsidiaries was as follows: Entergy Arkansas, (

$


million

); Entergy Louisiana,

$


million

; Entergy Mississippi,

$


million

; Entergy New Orleans,

$


million

; Entergy Texas,

$


million

; and System Energy,

$


.

Included in the effect of the computation of the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities is the recognition threshold and measurement of uncertain tax positions resulting in unrecognized tax benefits.  The final economic outcome of such unrecognized tax benefits is generally the result of a negotiated settlement with the IRS that often differs from the amount that is recorded as realizable under GAAP.  The intrinsic uncertainty with respect to all such tax positions means that the difference between current estimates of such amounts likely to be realized and actual amounts realized upon settlement may have an effect on income tax expense and the regulatory liability for income taxes in future periods.

Entergy anticipates that the Act, including the federal corporate income tax rate change, may continue to have ramifications that require adjustments in the future as certain events occur.  These events include: 1) the evaluation by regulators in all of Entergy’s jurisdictions regarding the ratemaking treatment of the Act and excess ADIT; 2) IRS audit adjustments to or amendments of federal and state income tax returns that include modifications to the computation of taxable income resulting from the Act; and 3) additional guidance, interpretations, or rulings by the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the IRS.  The potential exists for these types of events to result in future tax expense adjustments because of the difference in the federal corporate income tax rate between past and future periods and the effect of the tax rate change on ratemaking.  In turn, these items also could potentially affect the regulatory liability for income taxes.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities Restructuring

The tax classification of the entity that owned FitzPatrick changed in the second quarter 2016.  The change in tax classification required Entergy to recognize the plant’s nuclear decommissioning liability for income tax purposes resulting in a tax accounting permanent difference that reduced income tax expense, net of unrecognized tax benefits, by

$


million

.  The accrual of the nuclear decommissioning liability also required Entergy to recognize a gain for income tax purposes, a significant portion of which resulted in an increase in tax basis of the assets.  Recognition of the gain and the increase in tax basis of the assets represents a tax accounting temporary difference.  Entergy sold FitzPatrick on March 31, 2017.  The removal of the contingencies regarding the sale of the plant and the receipt of NRC approval for the sale allowed Entergy to re-determine the plant’s tax basis.  The re-determined basis resulted in a

$


million

income tax benefit in the first quarter 2017.

In the second quarter 2017, Entergy changed the tax classification of legal entities that own Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants.  The change in tax classification required Entergy to recognize the plants’ nuclear decommissioning liabilities for income tax purposes resulting in a tax accounting permanent difference that reduced income tax expense, net of unrecognized tax benefits, by

$


million

.  The accrual of the nuclear decommissioning liabilities also required Entergy to recognize a gain for income tax purposes, a portion of which resulted in an increase in tax basis of the assets.  Recognition of the gain and the increase in tax basis of the assets represents a tax accounting temporary difference.

In the third quarter 2018, Entergy completed a restructuring of the investment holdings in one of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant decommissioning trusts that resulted in an adjustment to tax basis for the trust.  The accounting standards provide that a taxable temporary difference does not exist if the tax law provides a means by which an amount can be recovered without incurrence of tax.  The restructuring allows Entergy to recover assets from the trust without incurring tax.  As such, the tax basis recognized resulted in the reversal of a deferred tax liability and reduction of income tax expense of approximately

$


million

.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

In the fourth quarter 2019, two separate events occurred resulting in a reduction of tax expense of

$


million

.  In November 2019 an Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiary recognized a reduction in income tax expense of

$


million

in connection with the accounting method on power contracts associated with the Palisades nuclear power station.  Additionally, Entergy’s ownership of Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 was restructured.   The restructuring required Entergy to recognize Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 nuclear decommissioning liabilities for income tax purposes resulting in a tax accounting permanent difference that reduced income tax expense, net of unrecognized tax benefits, by

$


million

.  The accrual of the nuclear decommissioning liabilities also required Entergy to recognize a gain for income tax purposes, a portion of which resulted in an increase in the tax basis of the assets.  Recognition of the gain and the increase in the tax basis of the assets represents a tax accounting temporary difference.

Immediately prior to the restructuring, through its ownership of Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3, Entergy donated property to Stony Brook University and recognized an associated tax deduction resulting in a decrease to tax expense of

$


million

.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities Tax Audit

A state income tax audit involving Entergy Wholesale Commodities was concluded during the third quarter 2018.  Upon conclusion of the audit, subsidiaries within Entergy Wholesale Commodities reversed a portion of the provision for uncertain tax positions totaling approximately

$


million

, net of tax and interest paid.

Tax Accounting Methods

In the fourth quarter 2015, System Energy and Entergy Louisiana adopted a new method of accounting for income tax return purposes in which their nuclear decommissioning costs will be treated as production costs of electricity includable in cost of goods sold.  The new method resulted in a reduction of taxable income of

$

1.2

billion

for System Energy and

$

2.2

billion

for Energy Louisiana.  In the fourth quarter 2018, Entergy Arkansas adopted the same method of accounting for its nuclear decommissioning costs which resulted in a

$

2.2

billion

reduction in taxable income.

In 2016, Entergy Louisiana elected mark-to-market income tax treatment for various wholesale electric power purchase and sale agreements, including Entergy Louisiana’s contract to purchase electricity from the Vidalia hydroelectric facility and from System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  The election resulted in a

$

2.2

billion

deductible temporary difference.  In 2017, Entergy New Orleans also elected mark-to-market income tax treatment for wholesale electric contracts which resulted in a

$

1.1

billion

deductible temporary difference.  In 2018, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi accrued deductible temporary differences related to mark-to-market tax accounting for wholesale electric contracts of

$

2.1

billion

and

$

1.9

billion

, respectively.

Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi Internal Restructuring

In the fourth quarter 2018, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC.  The change in ownership required Entergy to recognize Entergy Arkansas’s nuclear decommissioning liabilities for income tax purposes resulting in a tax accounting permanent difference that reduced income tax expense, net of unrecognized tax benefits, by

$


million

.  The accrual of the nuclear decommissioning liabilities also required Entergy to recognize a gain for income tax purposes, a portion of which resulted in an increase in the tax basis of the assets.  Recognition of the gain and the increase in the tax basis of the assets represents a tax accounting temporary difference.  Additionally, Entergy recorded a

$


million

reduction of income tax expense associated with state income tax effects resulting in a total reduction of income tax expense of

$


million

from the restructuring.  Entergy recorded a regulatory liability of

$


million

(

$


million

net-of-tax) which partially offsets the reduction of income tax expense.  Entergy Arkansas’s member’s equity increased by

$


million

as a result of the restructuring.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the internal restructuring.

Arkansas Corporate Income Tax Rate Reduction

In April 2019 the state of Arkansas enacted corporate income tax law changes that phase in an Arkansas tax rate reduction from the current rate of

6.5

%

to

6.2

%

in 2021 and

5.9

%

in 2022.  The rate reduction will eventually reduce Entergy Arkansas’s combined federal and state applicable tax rate by less than

0.5

%

once fully adopted.  As a result of the rate reduction, Entergy Arkansas recorded a regulatory liability for income taxes of approximately

$


million

which includes a tax gross-up related to the treatment of income taxes in the ratemaking formula.  The Arkansas tax law enactment also phases in an increase to the net operating loss carryover period from five to ten years.

Consolidated Income Tax Return of Entergy Corporation

In September 2019, Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC and its regulated, wholly-owned subsidiaries including Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans, became eligible to and joined the Entergy Corporation consolidated federal income tax group.  As a result of these four Utility operating companies re-joining the Entergy Corporation consolidated tax return group, Entergy was able to recognize a

$


million

deferred tax asset associated with a previously unrecognized Arkansas net operating loss carryover.

Additionally, in September 2019, Entergy Texas issued

$


million

of

5.375

%

Series A preferred stock with a liquidation value of

$


per share resulting in the disaffiliation and de-consolidation of Entergy Texas from the consolidated federal income tax return of Entergy Corporation.  These changes will not affect the accrual or allocation of income taxes for the Registrant Subsidiaries.  See Note 6 to the financial statements for discussion of the preferred stock issuance.

Vermont Yankee

The Vermont Yankee transaction resulted in Entergy generating a net deferred tax asset in January 2019.  The deferred tax asset could not be fully realized by Entergy in the first quarter of 2019; accordingly, Entergy accrued a net tax expense of

$


million

on the disposition of Vermont Yankee.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the Vermont Yankee transaction.

Entergy Arkansas Securitization Bonds

In June 2010 the APSC issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of bonds to recover Entergy Arkansas’s January 2009 ice storm damage restoration costs, including carrying costs of

$

11.5

million

and

$

4.6

million

of up-front financing costs.  In August 2010, Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Arkansas, issued

$

124.1

million

of storm cost recovery bonds.  The bonds have a coupon of

2.30

%

.  Although the principal amount is not due until August 2021, Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding expects to make principal payments on the bonds in the amount of

$

7.3

million

for 2020.  With the proceeds, Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding purchased from Entergy Arkansas the storm recovery property, which is the right to recover from customers through a storm recovery charge amounts sufficient to service the securitization bonds.  The storm recovery property is reflected as a regulatory asset on the consolidated Entergy Arkansas balance sheet.  The creditors of Entergy Arkansas do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, including the storm recovery property, and the creditors of Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy Arkansas.  Entergy Arkansas has no payment obligations to Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding except to remit storm recovery charge collections.

Grand Gulf Sale-Leaseback Transactions

In 1988, in two separate but substantially identical transactions, System Energy sold and leased back undivided ownership interests in Grand Gulf for the aggregate sum of

$


million

.  The initial term of the leases expired in July 2015.  System Energy renewed the leases for fair market value with renewal terms expiring in July 2036.  At the end of the new lease renewal terms, System Energy has the option to repurchase the leased interests in Grand Gulf or renew the leases at fair market value.  In the event that System Energy does not renew or purchase the interests, System Energy would surrender such interests and their associated entitlement of Grand Gulf’s capacity and energy.

System Energy is required to report the sale-leaseback as a financing transaction in its financial statements.  As such, it has recognized debt for the lease obligation and retained the portion of the plant subject to the sale-leaseback on its balance sheet.  For financial reporting purposes, System Energy has recognized interest expense on the debt balance and depreciation on the applicable plant balance.  The lease payments are recognized as principal and interest

Notes to Financial Statements

payments on the debt balance.  However, operating revenues include the recovery of the lease payments because the transactions are accounted for as a sale and leaseback for ratemaking purposes.  Consistent with a recommendation contained in a FERC audit report, System Energy initially recorded as a net regulatory asset the difference between the recovery of the lease payments and the amounts expensed for interest and depreciation and continues to record this difference as a regulatory asset or liability on an ongoing basis, resulting in a

net balance for the regulatory asset at the end of the lease term.  The amount was a net regulatory liability of

Dividends and distributions paid on all of Entergy Corporation’s subsidiaries’ preferred stock and membership interests series may be eligible for the dividends received deduction.

Presentation of Preferred Stock without Sinking Fund

Accounting standards regarding non-controlling interests and the classification and measurement of redeemable securities require the classification of preferred securities between liabilities and shareholders’ equity on the balance sheet if the holders of those securities have protective rights that allow them to gain control of the board of directors in certain circumstances.  These rights would have the effect of giving the holders the ability to potentially redeem their securities, even if the likelihood of occurrence of these circumstances is considered remote.  The outstanding preferred stock of Entergy Texas has protective rights with respect to unpaid dividends but provides for the election of board members that would not constitute a majority of the board, and the preferred stock of Entergy Texas is therefore classified as a component of equity.

The outstanding preferred securities of Entergy Utility Holding Company (a Utility subsidiary) and Entergy Finance Holding (an Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiary), whose preferred holders have protective rights, are presented between liabilities and equity on Entergy’s consolidated balance sheets.  The preferred dividends or distributions paid by all subsidiaries are reflected for all periods presented outside of consolidated net income.

Equity Forward Sale Agreements

In June 2018, Entergy marketed an equity offering of

15.3

million

shares of common stock.  In lieu of issuing equity at the time of the offering, Entergy entered into forward sale agreements with various investment banks.  The equity forwards required Entergy to, at its election prior to June 7, 2019, either (i) physically settle the transactions by issuing the total of

15.3

million

shares of its common stock to the investment banks in exchange for net proceeds at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreements (initially

$

74.45

per share) or (ii) net settle the transactions in whole or in part through the delivery or receipt of cash or shares.   The forward sale price was subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor and decreased by other fixed amounts specified in the agreements.

In December 2018, Entergy physically settled a portion of its obligations under the forward sale agreements by delivering

6,834,221

shares of common stock in exchange for cash proceeds of

$


million

.  The forward sale price used to determine the cash proceeds received by Entergy was calculated based on the initial forward sale price

Entergy used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included repayment of commercial paper, outstanding loans under Entergy’s revolving credit facility, and other debt.

Retained Earnings and Dividends

Entergy implemented ASU No. 2016-01 “Financial Instruments (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” effective January 1, 2018.  The ASU requires investments in equity securities, excluding those accounted for under the equity method or resulting in consolidation of the investee, to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.  Entergy implemented this standard using a modified retrospective method, and recorded an adjustment increasing retained earnings and reducing accumulated other comprehensive income by

$


million

as of January 1, 2018 for the cumulative effect of the unrealized gains and losses on investments in equity securities held by the decommissioning trust funds that do not meet the criteria for regulatory accounting treatment.  See Note 16 to the financial statements for further discussion of effects of the new standard.

Entergy implemented ASU No. 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory” effective January 1, 2018.  The ASU requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity asset transfers, other than inventory, at the time the transfer occurs.  Entergy implemented this standard using a modified retrospective method, and recorded an adjustment decreasing retained earnings by

$


million

as of January 1, 2018 for the cumulative effect of recording deferred tax assets on previously-recognized intra-entity asset transfers.

Entergy adopted ASU No. 2018-02, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income,” in the first quarter 2018.  The ASU allows a one-time reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for certain tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that would otherwise be stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Entergy’s policy for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income for available-for-sale securities is to use the portfolio approach.  Entergy elected to reclassify the

$

15.5

million

of stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to retained earnings (

$


million

decrease) or the regulatory liability for income taxes (

$

16.5

million

increase). Entergy’s reclassification only includes the effect of the change in the federal corporate income tax rate on accumulated other comprehensive income.

Entergy implemented ASU No. 2017-12 “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” effective January 1, 2019.  The ASU makes a number of amendments to hedge accounting, most significantly changing the recognition and presentation of highly effective hedges. Entergy implemented this standard using a modified retrospective method, and recorded an adjustment increasing retained earnings and increasing accumulated other comprehensive loss by approximately

$


million

as of January 1, 2019 for the cumulative effect of the ineffectiveness portion of designated hedges on nuclear power sales.

Entergy implemented ASU 2017-08 “Receivables (Topic 310): Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs” effective January 1, 2019.  The ASU amends the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium to the earliest call date.  Entergy implemented this standard using the modified retrospective approach, and

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries are involved in a number of legal, regulatory, and tax proceedings before various courts, regulatory commissions, and governmental agencies in the ordinary course of business.  While management is unable to predict with certainty the outcome of such proceedings, management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on Entergy’s results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.  Entergy discusses regulatory proceedings in Note 2 to the financial statements and discusses tax proceedings in Note 3 to the financial statements.

Vidalia Purchased Power Agreement

Entergy Louisiana has an agreement extending through the year 2031 to purchase energy generated by a hydroelectric facility known as the Vidalia project.  Entergy Louisiana made payments under the contract of approximately

$

135.5

million

in


,

$

137.6

million

in


, and

$

122.9

million

in


.  If the maximum percentage (

) of the energy is made available to Entergy Louisiana, current production projections would require estimated payments of approximately

$


million

in


, and a total of

$

1.44

billion

for the years 2021 through 2031.  Entergy Louisiana currently recovers the costs of the purchased energy through its fuel adjustment clause.

In an LPSC-approved settlement related to tax benefits from the tax treatment of the Vidalia contract, Entergy Louisiana agreed to credit rates by

$


million

each year for up to


years, beginning in October 2002.  In October 2011 the LPSC approved a settlement under which Entergy Louisiana agreed to provide credits to customers by crediting billings an additional

$

20.235

million

per year for


years beginning January 2012.  Entergy Louisiana recorded a regulatory charge and a corresponding regulatory liability to reflect this obligation.  The settlement agreement allowed for an adjustment to the credits if, among other things, there was a change in the applicable federal or state income tax rate.  As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in December 2017, and the lowering of the federal

Notes to Financial Statements

corporate income tax rate from


%

to


%

, the Vidalia purchased power regulatory liability was reduced by

, with a corresponding increase to Other regulatory credits on the income statement.  The effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are discussed further in Note 3 to the financial statements.

ANO Damage, Outage, and NRC Reviews

In March 2013, during a scheduled refueling outage at ANO 1, a contractor-owned and operated heavy-lifting apparatus collapsed while moving the generator stator out of the turbine building.  The collapse resulted in the death of an ironworker and injuries to several other contract workers, caused ANO 2 to shut down, and damaged the ANO turbine building.  The total cost of assessment, restoration of off-site power, site restoration, debris removal, and replacement of damaged property and equipment was approximately

$


million

.  Entergy Arkansas has pursued its options for recovering damages that resulted from the stator drop, including its insurance coverage and legal action.  Entergy Arkansas collected

$


million

in 2014 from Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurance company that provides property damage coverage to the members’ nuclear generating plants.  E

n

tergy Arkansas also collected a total of

$


million

in 2018 as a result of stator-related settlements.

In addition, Entergy Arkansas incurred replacement power costs for ANO 2 power during its outage and incurred incremental replacement power costs for ANO 1 power because the outage extended beyond the originally-planned duration of the refueling outage.  In February 2014 the APSC authorized Entergy Arkansas to retain the

$

65.9

million

in its deferred fuel balance with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information regarding various claims associated with the ANO stator incident is available.

In March 2015, after several NRC inspections and regulatory conferences, arising from the stator incident, the NRC placed ANO into the “multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column,” or Column 4, of the NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix.  Entergy Arkansas incurred incremental costs of approximately

$


million

in 2015 to prepare for the NRC inspections that began in early 2016 in order to address the issues required to move ANO back to “licensee response” or Column 1 of the NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix.  Excluding remediation and response costs that resulted from the additional NRC inspection activities, Entergy Arkansas incurred approximately

$


million

in 2016 and

$


million

in 2017 in support of NRC inspection activities and to implement Entergy Arkansas’s performance improvement initiatives developed in 2015.  In June 2018 the NRC moved ANO 1 and ANO 2 into the “licensee response column,” or Column 1, of the NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix.

In July 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed for a change in rates pursuant to its formula rate plan rider.  In that proceeding, the APSC approved a settlement agreement agreed upon by the parties, including a provision that requires Entergy Arkansas to initiate a regulatory proceeding for the purpose of recovering funds currently withheld from rates and related to the stator incident, including the

$

65.9

million

of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs and costs related to the incremental oversight previously noted, subject to certain timelines and conditions set forth in the settlement agreement.

Spent Nuclear Fuel Litigation

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is required, for a specified fee, to construct storage facilities for, and to dispose of, all spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste generated by domestic nuclear power reactors.  Entergy’s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries have been charged fees for the estimated future disposal costs of spent nuclear fuel in accordance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.  The affected Entergy companies entered into contracts with the DOE, whereby the DOE is to furnish disposal services at a cost of one mill per net kWh generated and sold after April 7, 1983, plus a one-time fee for generation prior to that date.  Entergy considers all costs incurred for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, except accrued interest, to be proper components of nuclear fuel expense.  Provisions to recover such costs have been or will be made in applications to regulatory authorities for the Utility plants.  Following the defunding of the Yucca Mountain spent fuel repository program, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and others sued the government seeking cessation of collection of the one mill per net kWh generated and sold after April 7, 1983 fee.  In November 2013 the D.C. Circuit Court of



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

Appeals ordered the DOE to submit a proposal to Congress to reset the fee to

zero

until the DOE complies with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act or Congress enacts an alternative waste disposal plan.  In January 2014 the DOE submitted the proposal to Congress under protest, and also filed a petition for rehearing with the D.C. Circuit.  The petition for rehearing was denied.  The zero spent fuel fee went into effect prospectively in May 2014.

Because the DOE has not begun accepting spent fuel, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts.  As a result of the DOE’s failure to begin disposal of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and the spent fuel disposal contracts, Entergy’s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries have incurred and will continue to incur damages.  Beginning in November 2003 these subsidiaries have pursued litigation to recover the damages caused by the DOE’s delay in performance.  Following are details of final judgments recorded by Entergy in 2017, 2018, and 2019 related to Entergy’s nuclear owner licensee subsidiaries’ litigation with the DOE.

In September 2016 the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a judgment in the Entergy Nuclear Palisades case in the amount of

$


million

.  Entergy Nuclear Palisades recorded a receivable for that amount, and subsequently received payment from the U.S. Treasury in January 2017.   The effects of recording the judgment were reductions to plant and other operation and maintenance expenses.  The Palisades damages awarded included

$


million

related to costs previously capitalized and

$


million

related to costs previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expense.  Of the

$


million

, Entergy recorded

$


million

as a reduction to previously-recorded depreciation expense.  Entergy reduced its Palisades plant asset balance by the remaining

$


million

.  The Court previously issued a partial judgment in the case in the amount of

$


million

, which was paid by the U.S. Treasury in October 2015.

In October 2016 the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a judgment in the second round Entergy Nuclear Indian Point 2 case in the amount of

$


million

.  Entergy Nuclear Indian Point 2 recorded a receivable for that amount, and subsequently received payment from the U.S. Treasury in January 2017.  The effects of recording the judgment were reductions to plant and other operation and maintenance expenses.  The Indian Point 2 damages awarded included

$


million

related to costs previously capitalized,

$


million

related to costs previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expense,

$


million

related to previously recorded decommissioning expense, and

$


million

related to costs previously recorded as taxes other than income taxes.  Of the

$


million

, Entergy recorded

$


million

as a reduction to previously-recorded depreciation expense.  Entergy reduced its Indian Point 2 plant asset balance by the remaining

$


million

.

In September 2018 the DOE submitted an offer of judgment to resolve claims in the second round Entergy Nuclear Generation Company case involving Pilgrim.  The

$


million

offer was accepted by Entergy Nuclear Generation Company, and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a judgment in that amount in favor of Entergy Nuclear Generation Company.  Entergy received payment from the U.S. Treasury in October 2018.  The effect in 2018 of recording the judgment was a reduction to plant and other operation and maintenance expenses.  The Pilgrim damages awarded included

$

In August 2019 the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a final judgment in the amount of

$


million

in favor of Entergy Louisiana against the DOE in the second round River Bend damages case.  Entergy Louisiana received payment from the U.S. Treasury in September 2019.  The effects in 2019 of recording the judgment were reductions to plant, nuclear fuel expense, and other operation and maintenance expense.  The River Bend damages awarded included

$


million

related to costs previously recorded as nuclear fuel expense,

$


million

related to costs previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expense, and

$


million

in costs previously capitalized.

In December 2019 the DOE submitted an offer of judgment to resolve claims in the third round ANO damages case.  The

$

in that amount in favor of Entergy Arkansas and against the DOE.  Entergy Arkansas received payment from the U.S. Treasury in January 2020.  The effects in 2019 of recording the judgment were reductions to plant, nuclear fuel expense, other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense, and taxes other than income taxes.  The ANO damages awarded included

$

In December 2019 the Entergy FitzPatrick Properties (formerly Entergy Nuclear FitzPatrick) and the DOE entered into a settlement agreement and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a judgment in the amount of

$


million

in favor of Entergy FitzPatrick Properties against the DOE in the second round FitzPatrick damages case. Entergy received payment from the U.S. Treasury in January 2020.  Substantially all of the FitzPatrick damages awarded relate to costs previously expensed as asset write-offs, impairments, and related charges, and in December 2019 Entergy recorded

$


million

as a reduction to asset write-offs, impairments, and related charges.

Management cannot predict the timing or amount of any potential recoveries on other claims filed by Entergy subsidiaries, and cannot predict the timing of any eventual receipt from the DOE of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims damage awards.

Nuclear Insurance

Third Party Liability Insurance

The Price-Anderson Act requires that reactor licensees purchase insurance and participate in a secondary insurance pool that provides insurance coverage for the public in the event of a nuclear power plant accident.  The costs of this insurance are borne by the nuclear power industry.  Congress amended and renewed the Price-Anderson Act in 2005 for a term through 2025.  The Price-Anderson Act requires nuclear power plants to show evidence of financial protection in the event of a nuclear accident.  This protection must consist of

two

layers of coverage:

1.

The primary level is private insurance underwritten by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI) and provides public liability insurance coverage of

$


million

for each operating reactor.  If this amount is not sufficient to cover claims arising from an accident, the second level, Secondary Financial Protection, applies.

2.

Within the Secondary Financial Protection level, each nuclear reactor has a contingent obligation to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary level, regardless of proximity to the incident or fault, up to a maximum of approximately

$

137.6

million

per reactor per incident (Entergy’s maximum total contingent obligation per incident is

$

1.101

billion

).  This retrospective premium is payable at a rate currently set at approximately

$


million

per year per incident per nuclear power reactor.

3.

In the event that one or more acts of terrorism cause a nuclear power plant accident, which results in third-party damages – off-site property and environmental damage, off-site bodily injury, and on-site third-party bodily injury (i.e. contractors), the primary level provided by ANI combined with the Secondary Financial Protection would provide approximately

$


billion

in coverage.  The Terrorism Risk Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2007 created a government program that provides for up to

$


billion

in coverage in excess of existing coverage for a terrorist event.  Under current law, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act extends through 2020.

Currently,


nuclear reactors are participating in the Secondary Financial Protection program that provides approximately

$


billion

in secondary layer insurance coverage to compensate the public in the event of a nuclear power reactor accident.  The Price-Anderson Act provides that all potential liability for a nuclear accident is limited to the amounts of insurance coverage available under the primary and secondary layers.

Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana each have

two

licensed reactors.  System Energy has

one

licensed reactor (

rata basis in any retrospective premium assessment to System Energy under the Price-Anderson Act).  The Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment includes the ownership, operation, and decommissioning of

three

nuclear power reactors and the ownership of the shutdown Indian Point 1 reactor and Big Rock Point facility.  The Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment previously included two nuclear power reactors that were sold in 2019.  Vermont Yankee was sold in January 2019 and Pilgrim was sold in August 2019.

Property Insurance

Entergy’s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries are members of NEIL, a mutual insurance company that provides property damage coverage, including decontamination and reactor stabilization, to the members’ nuclear generating plants.  The property damage insurance limits procured by Entergy for its Utility plants and Entergy Wholesale Commodity plants are in compliance with the financial protection requirements of the NRC.

The Utility plants’ (ANO 1 and 2, Grand Gulf, River Bend, and Waterford 3) property damage insurance limits are

$

1.5

billion

per occurrence at each plant with an additional

$


million

per occurrence that is shared among the plants.   Property damage from earthquake and volcanic eruption is excluded from the first

$


million

in coverage for all Utility plants.  Property damage from flood is excluded from the first

$


million

in coverage at ANO 1 and 2 and Grand Gulf.  Property damage from flood for Waterford 3 and River Bend includes a deductible of

$


million

plus an additional


%

of the amount of the loss in excess of

$


million

, up to a maximum deductible of

$


million

. Property damage from wind for all of the Utility nuclear plants includes a deductible of

$


million

plus an additional


%

of the amount of the loss in excess of

$


million

, up to a total maximum deductible of

$


million

.

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ plants (Palisades, Indian Point 2, Indian Point 3, and Big Rock Point) have property damage insurance limits as follows: Big Rock Point -

$


million

per occurrence; Palisades -

$

1.115

billion

per occurrence; and Indian Point -

$

1.6

billion

per occurrence.  For losses that are considered non-nuclear in nature, the property damage insurance limit at Palisades and Indian Point is

$


million

.  Property damage from wind and flood at Indian Point includes a deductible of

$


million

plus an additional


%

of the amount of the loss in excess of

$


million

, up to a maximum deductible of

$


million

, but property damage from earthquake and volcanic eruption at Indian Point is excluded from the first

$


million

.  Property damage from wind, flood, earthquake, and volcanic eruption at Palisades includes a deductible of

$


million

plus an additional


%

of the amount of the loss in excess of

$


million

, up to a maximum deductible of

$


million

.  Property damage from wind, flood, earthquake, and volcanic eruption at Big Rock Point includes a deductible of

$


million

plus an additional


%

of the amount of the loss in excess of

$


million

, up to a maximum deductible of

$


million

.

The value of the insured property at the time of an accident at Palisades has been changed from replacement cost to actual cash value.

In addition, Waterford 3 and Grand Gulf are also covered under NEIL’s Accidental Outage Coverage program.  Due to Entergy’s gradual exit from the merchant/wholesale power business, Entergy no longer purchases Accidental Outage Coverage for its non-regulated, non-generation assets.  Accidental outage coverage provides indemnification for the actual cost incurred in the event of an unplanned outage resulting from property damage covered under the NEIL Primary Property Insurance policy, subject to a deductible period.  The indemnification for the actual cost incurred is based on market power prices at the time of the loss.  After the deductible period has passed, weekly indemnities for an unplanned outage, covered under NEIL’s Accidental Outage Coverage program, would be paid according to the amounts listed below:

•


%

of the weekly indemnity for each week for the first payment period of 52 weeks; then

•


%

of the weekly indemnity for each week for the second payment period of 52 weeks; and thereafter

•


%

of the weekly indemnity for an additional 58 weeks for the third and final payment period.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

Under the property damage and accidental outage insurance programs, all NEIL insured plants could be subject to assessments should losses exceed the accumulated funds available from NEIL.

Effective April 1, 2019, the maximum amounts of such possible assessments per occurrence were as follows:

Potential assessments for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants are covered by insurance obtained through NEIL’s reinsurers.

NRC regulations provide that the proceeds of this insurance must be used, first, to render the reactor safe and stable, and second, to complete decontamination operations.  Only after proceeds are dedicated for such use and regulatory approval is secured would any remaining proceeds be made available for the benefit of plant owners or their creditors.

In the event that one or more acts of terrorism causes property damage under one or more or all nuclear insurance policies issued by NEIL (including, but not limited to, those described above) within 12 months from the date the first property damage occurs, the maximum recovery under all such nuclear insurance policies shall be an aggregate not exceeding

$

3.24

billion

plus the additional amounts recovered for such losses from reinsurance, indemnity, and any other sources applicable to such losses.

Non-Nuclear Property Insurance

Entergy’s non-nuclear property insurance program provides coverage on a system-wide basis for Entergy’s non-nuclear assets.  The insurance program provides coverage for property damage up to

$


million

per occurrence in excess of a

$


million

self-insured retention except for property damage caused by the following: earthquake shock, flood, and named windstorm, including associated storm surge.  For earthquake shock and flood, the insurance program provides coverage up to

$


million

on an annual aggregate basis in excess of a

$


million

self-insured retention.  For named windstorm and associated storm surge, the insurance program provides coverage up to

$


million

on an annual aggregate basis in excess of a

$


million

self-insured retention.  The coverage provided by the insurance program for the Entergy New Orleans gas distribution system is limited to

$


million

per occurrence and is subject to the same annual aggregate limits and retentions listed above for earthquake shock, flood, and named windstorm, including associated storm surge.

Covered property generally includes power plants, substations, facilities, inventories, and gas distribution-related properties.  Excluded property generally includes transmission and distribution lines, poles, and towers.  For substations valued at

$


million

or less, coverage for named windstorm and associated storm surge is excluded.  This coverage is in place for Entergy Corporation, the Registrant Subsidiaries, and certain other Entergy subsidiaries, including the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment.  Entergy also purchases

$


million

in terrorism insurance coverage for its conventional property.  The Terrorism Risk Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2007 created a government program that provides for up to

$


billion

in coverage in excess of existing coverage for a terrorist event.  Under current law, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act extends through 2020.

Employment and Labor-related Proceedings

The Registrant Subsidiaries and other Entergy subsidiaries are responding to various lawsuits in both state and federal courts and to other labor-related proceedings filed by current and former employees, recognized bargaining representatives, and certain third parties.  Generally, the amount of damages being sought is not specified in these proceedings.  These actions include, but are not limited to, allegations of wrongful employment actions; wage disputes and other claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act or its state counterparts; claims of race, gender, age, and disability discrimination; disputes arising under collective bargaining agreements; unfair labor practice proceedings and other administrative proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board or concerning the National Labor Relations Act; claims of retaliation; claims of harassment and hostile work environment; and claims for or regarding benefits under various Entergy Corporation-sponsored plans. Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries are responding to these lawsuits and proceedings and deny liability to the claimants.  Management believes that loss exposure has been and will continue to be handled so that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material, in the aggregate, to the financial position, results of operation, or cash flows of Entergy or the Utility operating companies.

Asbestos Litigation

(Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

Numerous lawsuits have been filed in federal and state courts, primarily by contractor employees who worked in the 1940-1980s timeframe, primarily against Entergy Texas, and to a lesser extent the other Utility operating companies, as premises owners of power plants, for damages caused by alleged exposure to asbestos.  Many other defendants are named in these lawsuits as well.  Currently, there are approximately


lawsuits involving approximately


claimants.  Management believes that adequate provisions have been established to cover any exposure.  Additionally, negotiations continue with insurers to recover reimbursements.  Management believes that loss exposure has been and will continue to be handled so that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material, in the aggregate, to the financial position, results of operation, or cash flows of the Utility operating companies.

Grand Gulf - Related Agreements

Unit Power Sales Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy)

System Energy has agreed to sell all of its share of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans in accordance with specified percentages (Entergy Arkansas-


%

, Entergy Louisiana-


%

, Entergy Mississippi-


%

, and Entergy New Orleans-


%

) as ordered by the FERC.  Charges under this agreement are paid in consideration for the purchasing companies’ respective entitlement to receive capacity and energy and are payable irrespective of the quantity of energy delivered.  The agreement will remain in effect until terminated by the parties and the termination is approved by the FERC, most likely upon Grand Gulf’s retirement from service.  In December 2016 the NRC granted the extension of Grand Gulf’s operating license to 2044.  Monthly obligations are based on actual capacity and energy costs.  The average monthly payments for 2019 under the agreement were approximately

$

17.6

million

for Entergy Arkansas,

$


million

for Entergy Louisiana,

$

15.5

million

for Entergy Mississippi, and

$

8.5

million

for Entergy New Orleans.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the complaints filed with the FERC against System Energy seeking a reduction in the return on equity component of the Unit Power Sales Agreement.

Availability Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy)

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans are individually obligated to make payments or subordinated advances to System Energy in accordance with stated percentages (Entergy Arkansas-

Notes to Financial Statements

of System Energy’s operating expenses as defined, including an amount sufficient to amortize the cost of Grand Gulf 2 over 27 years (See Reallocation Agreement terms below) and expenses incurred in connection with a permanent shutdown of Grand Gulf.  System Energy has assigned its rights to payments and advances to certain creditors as security for certain obligations.  Since commercial operation of Grand Gulf began, payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement have exceeded the amounts payable under the Availability Agreement.  Accordingly, no payments under the Availability Agreement have ever been required.  If Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Mississippi fails to make its Unit Power Sales Agreement payments, and System Energy is unable to obtain funds from other sources, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans could become subject to claims or demands by System Energy or its creditors for payments or advances under the Availability Agreement (or the assignments thereof) equal to the difference between their required Unit Power Sales Agreement payments and their required Availability Agreement payments.

Reallocation Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy)

System Energy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans entered into the Reallocation Agreement relating to the sale of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf and the related costs, in which Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans agreed to assume all of Entergy Arkansas’s responsibilities and obligations with respect to Grand Gulf under the Availability Agreement.  The FERC’s decision allocating a portion of Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Arkansas supersedes the Reallocation Agreement as it relates to Grand Gulf.  Responsibility for any Grand Gulf 2 amortization amounts has been individually allocated (Entergy Louisiana-

26.23

%

, Entergy Mississippi-

43.97

%

, and Entergy New Orleans-

29.80

) under the terms of the Reallocation Agreement.  However, the Reallocation Agreement does not affect Entergy Arkansas’s obligation to System Energy’s lenders under the assignments referred to in the preceding paragraph.  Entergy Arkansas would be liable for its share of such amounts if Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans were unable to meet their contractual obligations.  No payments of any amortization amounts will be required so long as amounts paid to System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, including other funds available to System Energy, exceed amounts required under the Availability Agreement, which is expected to be the case for the foreseeable future.

NOTE 9.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

Accounting standards require companies to record liabilities for all legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the normal operation of the assets.  For Entergy, substantially all of its asset retirement obligations consist of its liability for decommissioning its nuclear power plants.  In addition, an insignificant amount of removal costs associated with non-nuclear power plants is also included in the decommissioning and asset retirement costs line item on the balance sheets.

These liabilities are recorded at their fair values (which are the present values of the estimated future cash outflows) in the period in which they are incurred, with an accompanying addition to the recorded cost of the long-lived asset.  The asset retirement obligation is accreted each year through a charge to expense, to reflect the time value of money for this present value obligation.  The accretion will continue through the completion of the asset retirement activity.  The amounts added to the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets will be depreciated over the useful lives of the assets.  The application of accounting standards related to asset retirement obligations is earnings neutral to the rate-regulated business of the Registrant Subsidiaries.

In accordance with ratemaking treatment and as required by regulatory accounting standards, the depreciation provisions for the Registrant Subsidiaries include a component for removal costs that are not asset retirement obligations under accounting standards.

In accordance with regulatory accounting principles, the Registrant Subsidiaries have recorded regulatory assets (liabilities) in the following amounts to reflect their estimates of the difference between estimated incurred removal costs and estimated removal costs recovered in rates:

Nuclear Plant Decommissioning

Entergy periodically reviews and updates estimated decommissioning costs.  The actual decommissioning costs may vary from the estimates because of the timing of plant decommissioning, regulatory requirements, changes in technology, and increased costs of labor, materials, and equipment.  As described below, during


,


, and


, Entergy updated decommissioning cost estimates for certain nuclear power plants.

Utility

In the first quarter 2018, Entergy Louisiana recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for River Bend as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study.  The revised estimate resulted in an

$

85.4

million

increase in its decommissioning cost liability, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost asset that will be depreciated over the remaining life of the unit.

In the first quarter 2019, Entergy Arkansas recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liabilities for ANO 1 and ANO 2 as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study.  The revised estimates resulted in a $126.2



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

million increase in its decommissioning cost liabilities, along with corresponding increases in the related asset retirement cost assets that will be depreciated over the remaining lives of the units.

In the second quarter 2019, Entergy Louisiana recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for Waterford 3 as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study.  The revised estimate resulted in a

$

147.5

million

increase in its decommissioning cost liability, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost asset that will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of the unit.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities

Palisades

In the third quarter 2017, Entergy Wholesale Commodities recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for Palisades.  The revised estimate resulted in a

$

68.7

million

reduction in its decommissioning cost liability, along with a corresponding reduction in the plant asset.  The reduction in its estimated decommissioning cost liability resulted from the change in expectation regarding the timing of decommissioning cash flows due to the decision to continue to operate the plant until May 31, 2022.

Pilgrim

Entergy Nuclear Generation Company filed its Post-Shutdown Decommissioning Activities report (PSDAR) with the NRC in the fourth quarter 2018 for the Pilgrim plant in anticipation of its May 2019 shutdown.  As part of the development of the PSDAR, Entergy obtained a revised decommissioning cost study in the third quarter 2018.  The revised estimate resulted in a

$

117.5

million

increase in the decommissioning cost liability and a corresponding impairment charge.

Vermont Yankee

In the fourth quarter 2018, Entergy Wholesale Commodities recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for Vermont Yankee.  The revised estimate resulted in a

$


million

increase in the decommissioning cost liability, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost asset.  The revision was prompted by the progress of the Vermont Yankee sales transaction, which is described in Note 14 to the financial statements.  Entergy accordingly evaluated the Vermont Yankee asset retirement obligation in light of the terms of the sale transaction, upon determining that Vermont Yankee was in held for sale status.  Based on the terms of the sales agreement, which include Entergy receiving a note receivable from the purchaser, Entergy determined that

$


million

of the asset retirement cost was impaired, and it was accordingly written down in the fourth quarter 2018.  The Vermont Yankee plant was sold to NorthStar in January 2019.

NRC Filings Regarding Trust Funding Levels

Plant owners are required to provide the NRC with a biennial report (annually for units that have shut down or will shut down within five years), based on values as of December 31, addressing the owners’ ability to meet the NRC minimum funding levels.  Depending on the value of the trust funds, plant owners may be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional contributions to the trusts, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that NRC minimum funding requirements are met.

As nuclear plants individually approach and begin decommissioning, filings will be submitted to the NRC for planned shutdown activities.  These filings with the NRC also determine whether financial assurance may be required in addition to the nuclear decommissioning trust fund.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

Coal Combustion Residuals

In June 2010 the EPA issued a proposed rule on coal combustion residuals (CCRs) that contained two primary regulatory options: (1) regulating CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or received (including stored) in surface impoundments as so-called “special wastes” under the hazardous waste program of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C; or (2) regulating CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or surface impoundments as non-hazardous wastes under Subtitle D of RCRA.  Under both options, CCRs that are beneficially reused in certain processes would remain excluded from hazardous waste regulation.  In April 2015 the EPA published the final CCR rule with the material being regulated under the second scenario presented above - as non-hazardous wastes regulated under RCRA Subtitle D.  The final regulations create new compliance requirements including modified storage, new notification and reporting practices, product disposal considerations, and CCR unit closure criteria.  Entergy believes that on-site disposal options will be available at its facilities, to the extent needed for CCR that cannot be transferred for beneficial reuse.  In December 2016, the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act) was signed into law, which authorizes states to regulate coal ash rather than leaving primary enforcement to citizen suit actions.  States may submit to the EPA proposals for permit programs.  In September 2017 the EPA agreed to reconsider certain provisions of the coal combustion residuals (CCR) rule in light of the WIIN Act.  In March 2018 the EPA published its proposed revisions to the CCR rule with comments due at the end of April 2018.  In July 2018 the EPA released its initial revisions extending certain deadlines and incorporating some risk-based standards.  The EPA is expected to release additional revisions in another rulemaking.  In August 2018 the D.C. Circuit vacated several provisions of the CCR rule on the basis that they were inconsistent with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and remanded the matter to the EPA to conduct further rulemaking.  In August 2019 the EPA released its second set of proposed revisions to the CCR rule and plans at least three additional rulemakings.

In 2018 revisions to the CCR asset retirement obligations were made as a result of revised closure and post-closure cost estimates.  The revised estimates resulted in increases of

$

8.9

million

at Entergy Arkansas,

$

0.5

million

at Entergy Mississippi, and

$

0.1

million

at Entergy Wholesale Commodities in decommissioning cost liabilities, along with corresponding increases in related asset retirement cost assets that will be depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the respective units.

NOTE 10.

LEASES  (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

Entergy implemented ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” effective January 1, 2019.  The ASU’s core principle is that “a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases.” The ASU considers that “all leases create an asset and a liability,” and accordingly requires recording the assets and liabilities related to all leases with a term greater than 12 months.  Concurrent with the implementation of ASU 2016-02, Entergy implemented ASU 2018-01, “Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842,” which provided Entergy the option to elect not to evaluate existing land easements that are not currently accounted for as leases under the previous lease standard, and ASU 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements,” which intended to simplify the transition requirement giving Entergy the option to apply the transition provisions of the new standard at the date of adoption instead of at the earliest comparative period.  In implementing these ASUs, Entergy elected the options provided in both ASU 2018-01 and ASU 2018-11.  This accounting was applied to all lease agreements using the modified retrospective method, which required an adjustment to retained earnings for the cumulative effect of adopting the standard as of the effective date, and when implemented with ASU 2018-11, allowed Entergy to recognize the leased assets and liabilities on its balance sheet beginning on January 1, 2019 without restating prior periods.  In adopting the standard in January 2019, Entergy recognized right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities totaling approximately

$


million

, including

$


million

for Entergy Arkansas,

$


million

for Entergy Louisiana,

$


million

for Entergy Mississippi,

$


million

for Entergy New Orleans, and

$


million

for Entergy Texas.  Implementation of the standards had no material effect on consolidated net income; therefore, no adjustment to retained earnings was recorded.  The adoption of the standards had no effect on cash flows.

General

As of December 31, 2019, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries held operating and finance leases for fleet vehicles used in operations, real estate, and aircraft.  Excluded are power purchase agreements not meeting the definition of a lease, nuclear fuel leases, and the Grand Gulf sale-leaseback which were determined not to be leases under the accounting standards.

Leases have remaining terms of one year to 60 years.  Real estate leases generally include at least one five-year renewal option; however, renewal is not typically considered reasonably certain unless Entergy or a Registrant Subsidiary makes significant leasehold improvements or other modifications that would hinder its ability to easily move.  In certain of the lease agreements for fleet vehicles used in operations, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries provide residual value guarantees to the lessor.  Due to the nature of the agreements and Entergy’s continuing relationship with the lessor, however, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries expect to renegotiate or refinance the leases prior to conclusion of the lease.  As such, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries do not believe it is probable that they will be required to pay anything pertaining to the residual value guarantee, and the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are measured accordingly.

Entergy incurred the following total lease costs for the year ended December 31, 2019:

The lease costs disclosed above materially approximate the cash flows used by Entergy for leases with all costs included within operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, except for the finance lease costs which are included in financing activities.

Finance Leases

In allocating consideration in lease contracts to the lease and non-lease components, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries have made the accounting policy election to combine lease and non-lease components related to fleet vehicles used in operations, fuel storage agreements, and purchased power agreements and to allocate the contract consideration to both lease and non-lease components for real estate leases.

In accordance with ASU 2018-11, below is the lease disclosure from Note 10 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Sales and Leaseback Transactions

Waterford 3 Lease Obligation

In 1989, in three separate but substantially identical transactions, Entergy Louisiana sold and leased back undivided interests in Waterford 3 for the aggregate sum of

$

353.6

million

.  The leases were scheduled to expire in July 2017.  Entergy Louisiana was required to report the sale-leaseback as a financing transaction in its financial statements.

In December 2015, Entergy Louisiana agreed to purchase the undivided interests in Waterford 3 that were previously being leased.  The purchase was accomplished in a two-step transaction in which Entergy Louisiana first acquired the equity participant’s beneficial interest in the leased assets, followed by a termination of the leases and transfer of the leased assets to Entergy Louisiana when the outstanding lessor debt is paid.

In March 2016, Entergy Louisiana completed the first step in the two-step transaction by acquiring the equity participant’s beneficial interest in the leased assets.  Entergy Louisiana paid

$


million

in cash and

$


million

through the issuance of a non-interest bearing collateral trust mortgage note, payable in installments through July 2017.  Entergy Louisiana continued to make payments on the lessor debt that remained outstanding and that matured in January 2017.  The combination of payments on the

$


million

collateral trust mortgage note issued and the debt service on the lessor debt was equal in timing and amount to the remaining lease payments due from the closing of the transaction through the end of the lease term in July 2017.

Throughout the term of the lease, Entergy Louisiana had accrued a liability for the amount it expected to pay to retain the use of the undivided interests in Waterford 3 at the end of the lease term.  Since the sale-leaseback transaction was accounted for as a financing transaction, the accrual of this liability was accounted for as additional interest expense.  As of December 2015, the balance of this liability was

$

62.7

million

.  Upon entering into the agreement to purchase the equity participant’s beneficial interest in the undivided interests, Entergy Louisiana reduced the balance of the liability to

$


million

, and recorded the

$

2.7

million

difference as a credit to interest expense.  The

$


million

remaining liability was eliminated upon payment of the cash portion of the purchase price in 2016.

As of December 31, 2016, Entergy Louisiana, in connection with the Waterford 3 lease obligation, had a future minimum lease payment of

$

57.5

million

, including

$

2.3

million

in interest, due January 2017 that was recorded as long-term debt.

In February 2017 the leases were terminated and the leased assets were conveyed to Entergy Louisiana.

Grand Gulf Lease Obligations

In 1988, in two separate but substantially identical transactions, System Energy sold and leased back undivided ownership interests in Grand Gulf for the aggregate sum of

$


million

.  The initial term of the leases expired in July 2015.  System Energy renewed the leases in December 2013 for fair market value with renewal terms expiring in July 2036.  At the end of the new lease renewal terms, System Energy has the option to repurchase the leased interests in Grand Gulf or renew the leases at fair market value.  In the event that System Energy does not renew or purchase the interests, System Energy would surrender such interests and their associated entitlement of Grand Gulf’s capacity and energy.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

System Energy is required to report the sale-leaseback as a financing transaction in its financial statements.  For financial reporting purposes, System Energy expenses the interest portion of the lease obligation and the plant depreciation.  However, operating revenues include the recovery of the lease payments because the transactions are accounted for as a sale and leaseback for ratemaking purposes.  Consistent with a recommendation contained in a FERC audit report, System Energy initially recorded as a net regulatory asset the difference between the recovery of the lease payments and the amounts expensed for interest and depreciation and continues to record this difference as a regulatory asset or liability on an ongoing basis, resulting in a zero net balance for the regulatory asset at the end of the lease term.  The amount was a net regulatory liability of

$

55.6

million

as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

As of December 31, 2018, System Energy, in connection with the Grand Gulf sale and leaseback transactions, had future minimum lease payments that are recorded as long-term debt, as follows, which reflects the effect of the December 2013 renewal:

NOTE 11.

RETIREMENT, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS  (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

Qualified Pension Plans

Entergy has

eight

defined benefit qualified pension plans covering substantially all employees.  The Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan for Non-Bargaining Employees (Non-Bargaining Plan I), the Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan for Bargaining Employees (Bargaining Plan I), the Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan II for Non-Bargaining Employees (Non-Bargaining Plan II), the Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan II for Bargaining Employees, the Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan III, and the Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan IV for Bargaining Employees are non-contributory final average pay plans and provide pension benefits that are based on employees’ credited service and compensation during employment.  Non-bargaining employees whose most recent date of hire is after June 30, 2014 participate in the Entergy Corporation Cash Balance Plan for Non-Bargaining Employees (Non-Bargaining Cash Balance Plan).  Certain bargaining employees hired or rehired after June 30, 2014, or such later date provided for in their applicable collective bargaining agreements, participate in the Entergy Corporation Cash Balance Plan for Bargaining Employees (Bargaining Cash Balance Plan).  The Registrant Subsidiaries participate in these

four

plans:  Non-Bargaining Plan I, Bargaining Plan I, Non-Bargaining Cash Balance Plan, and Bargaining Cash Balance Plan.

The assets of the

six

final average pay defined benefit qualified pension plans are held in a master trust established by Entergy, and the assets of the

two

cash balance pension plans are held in a second master trust established by Entergy.  Each pension plan has an undivided beneficial interest in each of the investment accounts in its respective master trust that is maintained by a trustee.  Use of the master trusts permits the commingling of the trust assets of the pension plans of Entergy Corporation and its Registrant Subsidiaries for investment and administrative



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

purposes.  Although assets in the master trusts are commingled, the trustee maintains supporting records for the purpose of allocating the trust level equity in net earnings (loss) and the administrative expenses of the investment accounts in each trust to the various participating pension plans in that particular trust.  The fair value of the trusts’ assets is determined by the trustee and certain investment managers.  For each trust, the trustee calculates a daily earnings factor, including realized and unrealized gains or losses, collected and accrued income, and administrative expenses, and allocates earnings to each plan in the master trusts on a pro rata basis.

Within each pension plan, the record of each Registrant Subsidiary’s beneficial interest in the plan assets is maintained by the plan’s actuary and is updated quarterly.  Assets for each Registrant Subsidiary are increased for investment net income and contributions, and are decreased for benefit payments.  A plan’s investment net income/loss (i.e. interest and dividends, realized and unrealized gains and losses and expenses) is allocated to the Registrant Subsidiaries participating in that plan based on the value of assets for each Registrant Subsidiary at the beginning of the quarter adjusted for contributions and benefit payments made during the quarter.

Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries fund pension plans in an amount not less than the minimum required contribution under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The assets of the plans include common and preferred stocks, fixed-income securities, interest in a money market fund, and insurance contracts.  The Registrant Subsidiaries’ pension costs are recovered from customers as a component of cost of service in each of their respective jurisdictions.

Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy also currently offers retiree medical, dental, vision, and life insurance benefits (other postretirement benefits) for eligible retired employees.  Employees who commenced employment before July 1, 2014 and who satisfy certain eligibility requirements (including retiring from Entergy after a certain age and/or years of service with Entergy and immediately commencing their Entergy pension benefit), may become eligible for other postretirement benefits.

Effective January 1, 1993, Entergy adopted an accounting standard requiring a change from a cash method to an accrual method of accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions.  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas have received regulatory approval to recover accrued other postretirement benefit costs through rates.  The LPSC ordered Entergy Louisiana to continue the use of the pay-as-you-go method for ratemaking purposes for postretirement benefits other than pensions.  However, the LPSC retains the flexibility to examine individual companies’ accounting for other postretirement benefits to determine if special exceptions to this order are warranted.  Pursuant to regulatory directives, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy contribute the other postretirement benefit costs collected in rates into external trusts.  System Energy is funding, on behalf of Entergy Operations, other postretirement benefits associated with Grand Gulf.

Trust assets contributed by participating Registrant Subsidiaries are in master trusts, established by Entergy Corporation and maintained by a trustee.  Each participating Registrant Subsidiary holds a beneficial interest in the trusts’ assets.  The assets in the master trusts are commingled for investment and administrative purposes.  Although assets are commingled, supporting records are maintained for the purpose of allocating the beneficial interest in net earnings/(losses) and the administrative expenses of the investment accounts to the various participating plans and participating Registrant Subsidiaries. Beneficial interest in an investment account’s net income/(loss) is comprised of interest and dividends, realized and unrealized gains and losses, and expenses.  Beneficial interest from these investments is allocated to the plans and participating Registrant Subsidiary based on their portion of net assets in the pooled accounts.

Accounting for Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Accounting standards require an employer to recognize in its balance sheet the funded status of its benefit plans.  This is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation.  Entergy uses a December 31 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement plans.  Employers are to record previously unrecognized gains and losses, prior service costs, and any remaining transition asset or obligation (that resulted from adopting prior pension and other postretirement benefits accounting standards) as comprehensive income and/or as a regulatory asset reflective of the recovery mechanism for pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the Registrant Subsidiaries’ respective regulatory jurisdictions.  For the portion of Entergy Louisiana that is not regulated, the unrecognized prior service cost, gains and losses, and transition asset/obligation for its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are recorded as other comprehensive income.  Entergy Louisiana recovers other postretirement benefit costs on a pay-as-you-go basis and records the unrecognized prior service cost, gains and losses, and transition obligation for its other postretirement benefit obligation as other comprehensive income.  Accounting standards also require that changes in the funded status be recorded as other comprehensive income and/or a regulatory asset in the period in which the changes occur.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

With regard to pension and other postretirement costs, Entergy calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the long-term expected rate of return on assets by the market-related value (MRV) of plan assets.  In general, Entergy determines the MRV of its pension plan assets by calculating a value that uses a 20-quarter phase-in of the difference between actual and expected returns and for its other postretirement benefit plan assets Entergy generally uses fair value.

In accordance with ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost”, the other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations and are presented by Entergy in miscellaneous - net in other income.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Plans’ Assets

The Plan Administrator’s trust asset investment strategy is to invest the assets in a manner whereby long-term earnings on the assets (plus cash contributions) provide adequate funding for retiree benefit payments.  The mix of assets is based on an optimization study that identifies asset allocation targets in order to achieve the maximum return for an acceptable level of risk, while minimizing the expected contributions and pension and postretirement expense.

In the optimization studies, the Plan Administrator formulates assumptions about characteristics, such as expected asset class investment returns, volatility (risk), and correlation coefficients among the various asset classes.  The future market assumptions used in the optimization study are determined by examining historical market characteristics of the various asset classes and making adjustments to reflect future conditions expected to prevail over the study period.

The target asset allocation for pension adjusts dynamically based on the pension plans’ funded status.  The current targets are shown below.  The expectation is that the allocation to fixed income securities will increase as the pension plans’ funded status increases.  The following ranges were established to produce an acceptable, economically efficient plan to manage around the targets.

For postretirement assets the target and range asset allocations (as shown below) reflect recommendations made in the latest optimization study.  The target asset allocations for postretirement assets adjust dynamically based on the funded status of each sub-account within each trust.  The current weighted average targets shown below represent the aggregate of all targets for all sub-accounts within all trusts.

Entergy’s qualified pension and postretirement weighted-average asset allocations by asset category at

December 31, 2019

and


and the target asset allocation and ranges for 2018 are as follows:



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

In determining its expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in the calculation of benefit plan costs, Entergy reviews past performance, current and expected future asset allocations, and capital market assumptions of its investment consultant and some investment managers.

The expected long-term rate of return for the qualified pension plans’ assets is based primarily on the geometric average of the historical annual performance of a representative portfolio weighted by the target asset allocation defined in the table above, along with other indications of expected return on assets.  The time period reflected is a long-dated period spanning several decades.

The expected long-term rate of return for the non-taxable postretirement trust assets is determined using the same methodology described above for pension assets, but the aggregate asset allocation specific to the non-taxable postretirement assets is used.

For the taxable postretirement trust assets, the investment allocation includes tax-exempt fixed income securities.  This asset allocation, in combination with the same methodology employed to determine the expected return for other postretirement assets (as described above), and with a modification to reflect applicable taxes, is used to produce the expected long-term rate of return for taxable postretirement trust assets.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Entergy’s investment guidelines mandate the avoidance of risk concentrations.  Types of concentrations specified to be avoided include, but are not limited to, investment concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, geographic area and individual security issuance.  As of

December 31, 2019

, all investment managers and assets were materially in compliance with the approved investment guidelines, therefore there were no significant concentrations (defined as greater than


percent of plan assets) of credit risk in Entergy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets.

Fair Value Measurements

Accounting standards provide the framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

•

Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Plan has the ability to access at the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

•

Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are, either directly or indirectly, observable for the asset or liability at the measurement date.  Assets are valued based on prices derived by an independent party that uses inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and issuer spreads.  Prices are reviewed and can be challenged with the independent parties and/or overridden if it is believed such would be more reflective of fair value.  Level 2 inputs include the following:

-     quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;

-     quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets;

-     inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

-     inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

If an asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

•

Level 3 - Level 3 refers to securities valued based on significant unobservable inputs.

Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy, measured at fair value on a recurring basis at

Certain preferred stocks and certain fixed income debt securities (corporate, government, and securitized) are stated at fair value as determined by broker quotes.

(b)

Common stocks, certain preferred stocks, and certain fixed income debt securities (government) are stated at fair value determined by quoted market prices.

(c)

The common collective trusts hold investments in accordance with stated objectives.  The investment strategy of the trusts is to capture the growth potential of equity markets by replicating the performance of a specified index.  Net asset value per share of common collective trusts estimate fair value.  Certain of these common collective trusts are not publicly quoted and are valued by the fund administrators using net asset value as a practical expedient.  Accordingly, these funds are not assigned a level in the fair value table, but are included in the total.  In 2018 the fund administrator of these investments allowed trading three times in a 30-day period at the net asset value for certain of these common collective trusts.

(d)

Registered investment companies are money market mutual funds with a stable net asset value of one dollar per share.  Registered investment companies may hold investments in domestic and international bond markets or domestic equities and estimate fair value using net asset value per share.

(e)

Certain of these registered investment companies are not publicly quoted and are valued by the fund administrators using net asset value as a practical expedient.  Accordingly, these funds are not assigned a level in the fair value table, but are included in the total.

(f)

The other remaining assets are U.S. municipal and foreign government bonds stated at fair value as determined by broker quotes.

(g)

The unallocated insurance contract investments are recorded at contract value, which approximates fair value.  The contract value represents contributions made under the contract, plus interest, less funds used to pay benefits and contract expenses, and less distributions to the master trust.

With respect to the mortality assumptions, Entergy used the Pri-2012 Employee and Healthy Annuitant Tables with a fully generational MP-2019 projection scale, in determining its December 31, 2019 pension plans’ PBOs and the Pri.H 2012 (headcount weighted) Employee and Healthy Annuitant Tables with a fully generational MP-2019 projection scale, in determining its December 31, 2019 other postretirement benefit APBO.  Entergy used the RP-2014 Employee and Healthy Annuitant Tables (adjusted to base year 2006) with a fully generational MP-2018 projection scale, in determining its December 31, 2018 pension plans’ PBOs and other postretirement benefit APBO.

Defined Contribution Plans

Entergy sponsors the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries (System Savings Plan).  The System Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan covering eligible employees of Entergy and certain of its subsidiaries.  The participating Entergy subsidiary makes matching contributions to the System Savings Plan for all eligible participating employees in an amount equal to either


%

or


%

of the participants’ basic contributions, up to


%

of their eligible earnings per pay period.  The matching contribution is allocated to investments as directed by the employee.

Entergy also sponsors the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries VI (established in April 2007) and the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries VII (established in April 2007) to which matching contributions are also made.  The plans are defined contribution plans that cover eligible employees, as defined by each plan, of Entergy and certain of its subsidiaries.  Effective as of the close of business on December 31, 2017, the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries IV (Entergy Savings Plan IV) was merged into the System Savings Plan and all of the assets of Entergy Savings Plan IV were transferred to the System Savings Plan.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (Entergy Corporation)

Entergy grants stock options, restricted stock, performance units, and restricted stock units to key employees of the Entergy subsidiaries under its Equity Ownership Plans which are shareholder-approved stock-based compensation plans.  Effective May 3, 2019, Entergy’s shareholders approved the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2019 Plan).  The maximum number of common shares that can be issued from the 2019 Plan for stock-based awards is

7,300,000

all of which are available for incentive stock option grants.  The 2019 Plan applies to awards granted on or after May 3, 2019 and awards expire ten years from the date of grant.  As of

December 31, 2019

, there were

7,266,822

authorized shares remaining for stock-based awards.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted at exercise prices that equal the closing market price of Entergy Corporation common stock on the date of grant.  Generally, stock options granted will become exercisable in equal amounts on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant.  Unless they are forfeited previously under the terms of the grant, options expire


years after the date of the grant if they are not exercised.

The following table includes financial information for stock options for each of the years presented:

Entergy determines the fair value of the stock option grants by considering factors such as lack of marketability, stock retention requirements, and regulatory restrictions on exercisability in accordance with accounting standards.

The stock option weighted-average assumptions used in determining the fair values are as follows:



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

Stock price volatility is calculated based upon the daily public stock price volatility of Entergy Corporation common stock over a period equal to the expected term of the award.  The expected term of the options is based upon historical option exercises and the weighted average life of options when exercised and the estimated weighted average life of all vested but unexercised options.  In 2008, Entergy implemented stock ownership guidelines for its senior executive officers.  These guidelines require an executive officer to own shares of Entergy Corporation common stock equal to a specified multiple of his or her salary.  Until an executive officer achieves this ownership position the executive officer is required to retain


%

of the net-of-tax net profit upon exercise of the option to be held in Entergy Corporation common stock.  The reduction in fair value of the stock options due to this restriction is based upon an estimate of the call option value of the reinvested gain discounted to present value over the applicable reinvestment period.

Restricted Stock Awards

Entergy grants restricted stock awards earned under its stock benefit plans in the form of stock units.  One-third of the restricted stock awards will vest upon each anniversary of the grant date and are expensed ratably over the three-year vesting period.  Shares of restricted stock have the same dividend and voting rights as other common stock and are considered issued and outstanding shares of Entergy upon vesting.  In January 2019 the Board approved and Entergy granted

355,537

restricted stock awards under the 2015 Equity Ownership Plan.  The restricted stock awards were made effective as of January 31, 2019 and were valued at

Long-Term Performance Unit Program

Entergy grants long-term incentive awards earned under its stock benefit plans in the form of performance units, which represents the value of, and are settled with, one share of Entergy Corporation common stock at the end of the three-year performance period, plus dividends accrued during the performance period on the number of performance units earned.  The Long-Term Performance Unit Program specifies a minimum, target, and maximum achievement level, the achievement of which will determine the number of performance units that may be earned.  Entergy measures performance by assessing Entergy’s total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of the companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index.  For the 2019-2020 performance period, performance will be measured based

eighty

percent on relative total shareholder return and

twenty

percent on a cumulative adjusted earnings per share metric.

In January


the Board approved and Entergy granted

180,824

performance units under the 2015 Equity Ownership and Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan.  The performance units were granted as of January 31, 2019, and eighty percent were valued at

$

102.07

per share based on various factors, primarily market conditions; and twenty percent were valued at

$

89.19

per share, the closing price of Entergy Corporation’s common stock on that date.  Performance units have the same dividend and voting rights as other common stock, are considered issued and outstanding shares of Entergy upon vesting, and are expensed ratably over the 3-year vesting period, and compensation cost for the portion of the award based on cumulative adjusted earnings per share will be adjusted based on the number of units that ultimately vest.

BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION  (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

Entergy’s reportable segments as of

December 31, 2019

are Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.  Utility includes the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric power in portions of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, and natural gas utility service in portions of Louisiana.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities includes the ownership, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants located in the northern United States and the sale of the electric power produced by its operating plants to wholesale customers.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities also includes the ownership of interests in non-nuclear power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers.  “All Other” includes the parent company, Entergy Corporation, and other business activity.

Notes to Financial Statements

Entergy’s segment financial information is as follows:



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

Businesses marked with * are sometimes referred to as the “competitive businesses.”  Eliminations are primarily intersegment activity.  Almost all of Entergy’s goodwill is related to the Utility segment.

In March 2017, Entergy sold the FitzPatrick plant, which it had intended to shut down, to Exelon.  In January 2019, Entergy sold the Vermont Yankee plant, which it had previously shut down, to NorthStar.  In August 2019, Entergy sold the Pilgrim plant, which it had previously shut down, to Holtec. Entergy has also announced plans to shut down Indian Point 2 in 2020, Indian Point 3 in 2021, and Palisades in 2022, and has purchase and sale agreements with Holtec for each of them expected to close after they are shut down.  Management expects these transactions to result in the cessation of merchant power generation at all Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants owned and operated by Entergy by 2022.  Entergy will continue to have the obligation to decommission the nuclear plants pending their sales to third parties.

The decisions to shut down these plants and the related transactions resulted in asset impairments; employee retention and severance expenses and other benefits-related costs; and contracted economic development contributions.  The employee retention and severance expenses and other benefits-related costs and contracted economic development contributions are included in "Other operation and maintenance" in the consolidated statement of operations.

Registrant Subsidiaries

Each of the Registrant Subsidiaries has one reportable segment, which is an integrated utility business, except for System Energy, which is an electricity generation business.  Each of the Registrant Subsidiaries’ operations is managed on an integrated basis by that company because of the substantial effect of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight on the business process, cost structures, and operating results.

ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans)

Acquisitions

Choctaw Generating Station

In October 2019, Entergy Mississippi purchased the Choctaw Generating Station, an


MW natural gas fired combined-cycle turbine plant located near French Camp, Mississippi, from a subsidiary of GenOn Energy Inc.  The purchase price for the Choctaw Generating Station was approximately

$


million

.

Dispositions

Pilgrim

In July 2018, Entergy entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Holtec International to sell to a Holtec subsidiary


%

of the equity interests in Entergy Nuclear Generation Company, the owner of the Pilgrim plant.  In August 2019 the NRC approved the sale of the plant to Holtec.  The transaction closed in August 2019 for a purchase price of

$

1,000

(subject to adjustments for net liabilities and other amounts).  The sale included the transfer of the Pilgrim nuclear decommissioning trust and obligation for spent fuel management and plant decommissioning.  The transaction resulted in a loss of

$


million

(

$


million

net-of-tax) in the third quarter 2019.  The disposition-date fair value of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund was approximately

$

1,030

million

and the disposition-date fair value of the asset retirement obligation was

$


million

.  The transaction also included property, plant, and equipment with a net book value of

zero

, materials and supplies, and prepaid assets.

Willow Glen

In December 2018, Entergy Louisiana sold the Willow Glen Power Station, a non-operating gas plant.  Entergy Louisiana sold Willow Glen for approximately

$


million

in cash and the transfer of the obligation to decommission the plant.  Entergy Louisiana recognized a regulatory liability of

$

5.7

million

for return of removal costs previously collected in rates.  Entergy Louisiana realized a pre-tax gain of

$

14.8

million

on the sale.  Entergy Louisiana recorded a

$

31.9

million

regulatory liability to recognize the obligation to refund excess customer collections for decommissioning Willow Glen.

Vermont Yankee

In November 2016, Entergy entered into an agreement to sell


%

of the membership interests in Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, LLC to a subsidiary of NorthStar.  Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee was the owner of the Vermont Yankee plant.  The sale of Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee to NorthStar included the transfer of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund and the asset retirement obligation for the spent fuel management and decommissioning of the plant.

In March 2018, Entergy and NorthStar entered into a settlement agreement and a Memorandum of Understanding with State of Vermont agencies and other interested parties that set forth the terms on which the agencies and parties support the Vermont Public Utility Commission’s approval of the transaction.  The agreements provide additional financial assurance for decommissioning, spent fuel management and site restoration, and detail the site restoration standards.  In October 2018 the NRC issued an order approving the application to transfer Vermont Yankee’s license to NorthStar for decommissioning.  In December 2018, the Vermont Public Utility Commission issued an order approving the transaction consistent with the Memorandum of Understanding’s terms.  On January 11, 2019, Entergy and NorthStar closed the transaction.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee had an outstanding credit facility that was used to pay for dry fuel storage costs.  This credit facility was guaranteed by Entergy Corporation.  A subsidiary of Entergy assumed the obligations under the credit facility.  At the closing of the sale transaction, NorthStar caused Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, renamed NorthStar Vermont Yankee, to issue a

$


million

promissory note to the Entergy subsidiary that assumed the credit facility obligations.  The amount of the note included the balance outstanding on the credit facility, as well as borrowing fees and costs incurred by Entergy in connection with the credit facility.

With the receipt of the NRC and Vermont Public Utility Commission approvals and the resolution among the parties of the significant conditions of the sale, Entergy concluded that as of December 31, 2018 Vermont Yankee was in held for sale status.  Entergy accordingly evaluated the Vermont Yankee asset retirement obligation in light of the terms of the sale transaction and evaluated the remaining values of the Vermont Yankee assets.  These evaluations resulted in an increase in the asset retirement obligation and

$


million

of asset impairment and related other charges in the fourth quarter 2018.  See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the asset retirement obligation.  Upon closing of the transaction in January 2019, the Vermont Yankee decommissioning trust, along with the decommissioning obligation for the plant, was transferred to NorthStar.  The assets and liabilities associated with the sale of Vermont Yankee were classified as held for sale on the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018.  As of December 31, 2018, the value of the decommissioning trust was

$


million

.  As of December 31, 2018, the asset retirement cost asset was

$


million

, classified within other deferred debits, and the asset retirement cost obligation was

$


million

, classified within other non-current liabilities.

The Vermont Yankee spent fuel disposal contract was assigned to NorthStar as part of the transaction.  The Vermont Yankee transaction resulted in Entergy generating a net deferred tax asset in January 2019.  The deferred tax asset could not be fully realized by Entergy in the first quarter of 2019; accordingly, Entergy accrued a net tax expense of

$


million

on the disposition of Vermont Yankee.  The transaction also resulted in other charges of

$

5.4

million

(

$

4.2

million

net-of-tax) in the first quarter 2019.

FitzPatrick

In August 2016, Entergy entered into an agreement to sell the FitzPatrick plant, an


MW nuclear power plant that was owned by Entergy in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment.  In March 2017 the NRC approved the sale of the plant to Exelon.  The transaction closed in March 2017 for a purchase price of

$


million

, which included a

$


million

non-refundable signing fee paid in August 2016, in addition to the assumption by Exelon of certain liabilities related to the FitzPatrick plant, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of

$


million

.  At the transaction close, Exelon paid an additional

$


million

for the proration of certain expenses prepaid by Entergy.  The disposition-date fair value of the decommissioning trust fund was

$


million

, classified within other deferred debits, and the disposition-date fair value of the asset retirement obligation was

$


million

, classified within other non-current liabilities.  The transaction also included property, plant, and equipment with a net book value of

zero

, materials and supplies, and prepaid assets.

As part of the transaction, Entergy entered into a reimbursement agreement with Exelon pursuant to which Exelon reimbursed Entergy for specified out-of-pocket costs associated with Entergy’s operation of FitzPatrick prior to closing of the sale.  In the first quarter 2017, Entergy billed Exelon for reimbursement of

$


million

of other operation and maintenance expenses,

$


million

in lost operating revenues, and

$


million

in taxes other than income taxes, partially offset by a

$


million

defueling credit to Exelon.

As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, as a result of the sale of FitzPatrick on March 31, 2017, Entergy redetermined the plant’s tax basis, resulting in a

$


million

income tax benefit in the first quarter 2017.

Notes to Financial Statements

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

2017, 2018, and 2019 Impairments

Entergy continues to execute its strategy to shut down and sell all of the remaining plants in Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ merchant nuclear fleet, with planned shutdowns of Indian Point 2 by April 30, 2020, Indian Point 3 by April 30, 2021, and Palisades by May 31, 2022.  The remaining three Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear plants, FitzPatrick, Vermont Yankee, and Pilgrim, have been sold.  The FitzPatrick plant was classified as held-for-sale at December 31, 2016, and subsequently sold to Exelon in March 2017.  The Vermont Yankee plant was classified as held-for-sale at December 31, 2018, and subsequently sold to NorthStar on January 11, 2019.  The Pilgrim plant was sold to Holtec International on August 26, 2019.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities incurred

$


million

in 2019,

$


million

in 2018, and

$


million

in 2017 of impairment charges related to nuclear fuel spending, nuclear refueling outage spending, expenditures for capital assets, and asset retirement obligation revisions.  These costs were charged to expense as incurred as a result of the impaired fair value of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants’ long-lived assets due to the significantly reduced remaining estimated operating lives associated with management’s strategy to exit the Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant power business.  Entergy expects to continue to incur costs associated with nuclear fuel-related spending, expenditures for capital assets and, except for Palisades, expects to continue to charge these costs to expense as incurred because Entergy expects the value of the plants to continue to be impaired.

With respect to Palisades, Entergy and Consumers Energy had agreed to amend the existing PPA so that it would terminate early, on May 31, 2018.  In September 2017, however, Entergy and Consumers Energy agreed to terminate the PPA amendment agreement.  Entergy continues to operate Palisades under the current PPA with Consumers Energy, instead of shutting down in the fall of 2018 as previously planned.  Entergy intends to shut down the Palisades plant permanently no later than May 31, 2022.  As a result of the change in expected operating life of the Palisades plant, the expected probability-weighted undiscounted net cash flows as of September 30, 2017 exceeded the carrying value of the plant and related assets.  Accordingly, nuclear fuel spending, nuclear refueling outage spending, and expenditures for capital assets incurred at Palisades after September 30, 2017 are no longer charged to expense as incurred, but recorded as assets and depreciated or amortized, subject to the typical periodic impairment reviews prescribed in the accounting rules.

The impairments and other related charges are recorded as a separate line item in Entergy’s consolidated statements of operations and are included within the results of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment.  In addition to the impairments and other related charges, Entergy expects to incur additional charges through mid-2022 associated with these strategic transactions.  See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of these additional charges.

2018 Pilgrim Impairment

The Pilgrim plant ceased operations on May 31, 2019, at the end of its current fuel cycle.  Entergy Nuclear Generation Company filed its Post-Shutdown Decommissioning Activities Report (PSDAR) with the NRC in the fourth quarter 2018 for the Pilgrim plant.  As part of the development of the PSDAR, Entergy obtained a revised decommissioning cost study in the third quarter 2018.  The revised estimate resulted in a

$

117.5

million

increase in the decommissioning cost liability and a corresponding impairment charge in the third quarter 2018.  As discussed above in

Dispositions

, on August 26, 2019, Entergy sold the Pilgrim plant to a Holtec International subsidiary.

2018 Vermont Yankee Impairment

As discussed above in

Dispositions

, on January 11, 2019, Entergy sold the Vermont Yankee plant to NorthStar.  With the receipt of the NRC and Vermont Public Utility Commission approvals and the resolution among the parties of the significant conditions of the sale, Entergy concluded that as of December 31, 2018 Vermont Yankee was in held-

Notes to Financial Statements

for- sale status.  Entergy accordingly evaluated the Vermont Yankee asset retirement obligation in light of the terms of the sale transaction, and evaluated the remaining values of the Vermont Yankee assets.  These evaluations resulted in

$


million

of asset impairment and related charges in the fourth quarter 2018.  See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the revision of the asset retirement obligation.

NOTE 15.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND FAIR VALUES (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

Market Risk

In the normal course of business, Entergy is exposed to a number of market risks.  Market risk is the potential loss that Entergy may incur as a result of changes in the market or fair value of a particular commodity or instrument.  All financial and commodity-related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk including commodity price risk, equity price, and interest rate risk.  Entergy uses derivatives primarily to mitigate commodity price risk, particularly power price and fuel price risk.

The Utility has limited exposure to the effects of market risk because it operates primarily under cost-based rate regulation.  To the extent approved by their retail regulators, the Utility operating companies use derivative instruments to hedge the exposure to price volatility inherent in their purchased power, fuel, and gas purchased for resale costs that are recovered from customers.

As a wholesale generator, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ core business is selling energy, measured in MWh, to its customers.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities enters into forward contracts with its customers and also sells energy and capacity in the day ahead or spot markets.  In addition to its forward physical power and gas contracts, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may also use a combination of financial contracts, including swaps, collars, and options, to mitigate commodity price risk.  When the market price falls, the combination of instruments is expected to settle in gains that offset lower revenue from generation, which results in a more predictable cash flow.

Entergy’s exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors, including the size, term, composition, and diversification of positions held, as well as market volatility and liquidity.  For instruments such as options, the time period during which the option may be exercised and the relationship between the current market price of the underlying instrument and the option’s contractual strike or exercise price also affects the level of market risk.  A significant factor influencing the overall level of market risk to which Entergy is exposed is its use of hedging techniques to mitigate such risk.  Hedging instruments and volumes are chosen based on ability to mitigate risk associated with future energy and capacity prices; however, other considerations are factored into hedge product and volume decisions including corporate liquidity, corporate credit ratings, counterparty credit risk, hedging costs, firm settlement risk, and product availability in the marketplace.  Entergy manages market risk by actively monitoring compliance with stated risk management policies as well as monitoring the effectiveness of its hedging policies and strategies.  Entergy’s risk management policies limit the amount of total net exposure and rolling net exposure during the stated periods.  These policies, including related risk limits, are regularly assessed to ensure their appropriateness given Entergy’s objectives.

Derivatives

Some derivative instruments are classified as cash flow hedges due to their financial settlement provisions while others are classified as normal purchase/normal sale transactions due to their physical settlement provisions.  Normal purchase/normal sale risk management tools include power purchase and sales agreements, fuel purchase agreements, capacity contracts, and tolling agreements.  Financially-settled cash flow hedges can include natural gas and electricity swaps and options and interest rate swaps.  Entergy may enter into financially-settled swap and option contracts to manage market risk that may or may not be designated as hedging instruments.

Entergy enters into derivatives to manage natural risks inherent in its physical or financial assets or liabilities.

Notes to Financial Statements

Electricity over-the-counter instruments and futures contracts that financially settle against day-ahead power pool prices are used to manage price exposure for Entergy Wholesale Commodities generation.  The maximum length of time over which Entergy Wholesale Commodities is currently hedging the variability in future cash flows with derivatives for forecasted power transactions at

December 31, 2019

is approximately

1.25

years

.  Planned generation currently under contract from Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants is

Entergy may use standardized master netting agreements to help mitigate the credit risk of derivative instruments.  These master agreements facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty and may include collateral requirements.  Cash, letters of credit, and parental/affiliate guarantees may be obtained as security from counterparties in order to mitigate credit risk.  The collateral agreements require a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit in the event an exposure exceeds an established threshold.  The threshold represents an unsecured credit limit, which may be supported by a parental/affiliate guarantee, as determined in accordance with Entergy’s credit policy.  In addition, collateral agreements allow for termination and liquidation of all positions in the event of a failure or inability to post collateral.

Certain of the agreements to sell the power produced by Entergy Wholesale Commodities power plants contain provisions that require an Entergy subsidiary to provide credit support to secure its obligations depending on the mark-to-market values of the contracts.  The primary form of credit support to satisfy these requirements is an Entergy Corporation guarantee.  As of

December 31, 2019

, there were no derivative contracts with counterparties in a liability position.  In addition to the corporate guarantee,

$


million

in cash collateral was required to be posted by the Entergy subsidiary to its counterparties and

$


million

in cash collateral and

$


million

in letters of credit were required to be posted by its counterparties to the Entergy subsidiary.  As of

December 31, 2018

, derivative contracts with

six

counterparties were in a liability position (approximately

$


million

total).  In addition to the corporate guarantee,

$


million

in cash collateral was required to be posted by the Entergy subsidiary to its counterparties.  If the Entergy Corporation credit rating falls below investment grade, Entergy would have to post collateral equal to the estimated outstanding liability under the contract at the applicable date.

Entergy manages fuel price volatility for its Louisiana jurisdictions (Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans) and Entergy Mississippi through the purchase of natural gas swaps and options that financially settle against either the average Henry Hub Gas Daily prices or the NYMEX Henry Hub.  These swaps and options are marked-to-market through fuel expense with offsetting regulatory assets or liabilities.  All benefits or costs of the program are recorded in fuel costs.  The notional volumes of these swaps are based on a portion of projected annual exposure to gas price volatility for electric generation at Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Mississippi and projected winter purchases for gas distribution at Entergy New Orleans.  The maximum length of time over which Entergy has executed natural gas swaps and options as of December 31, 2019 is

4.25

years

for Entergy Louisiana and the maximum length of time over which Entergy has executed natural gas swaps as of December 31, 2019 is

MMBtu for Entergy Louisiana,

9,330,000

MMBtu for Entergy Mississippi, and

556,000

MMBtu for Entergy New Orleans.  Credit support for these natural gas swaps and options is covered by master agreements that do not require Entergy to provide collateral based on mark-to-market value but do carry adequate assurance language that may lead to requests for collateral.

During the second quarter 2019, Entergy participated in the annual financial transmission rights auction process for the MISO planning year of June 1, 2019 through May 31, 2020.  Financial transmission rights are derivative instruments that represent economic hedges of future congestion charges that will be incurred in serving Entergy’s customer load.  They are not designated as hedging instruments.  Entergy initially records financial transmission rights at their estimated fair value and subsequently adjusts the carrying value to their estimated fair value at the end of each accounting period prior to settlement.  Unrealized gains or losses on financial transmission rights held by Entergy Wholesale Commodities are included in operating revenues.   The Utility operating companies recognize regulatory liabilities or assets for unrealized gains or losses on financial transmission rights.  The total volume of financial

Credit support for financial transmission rights held by the Utility operating companies is covered by cash and/or letters of credit issued by each Utility operating company as required by MISO.  Credit support for financial transmission rights held by Entergy Wholesale Commodities is covered by cash.  No cash or letters of credit were required to be posted for financial transmission rights exposure for Entergy Wholesale Commodities as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.  Letters of credit posted with MISO covered the financial transmission rights exposure for Entergy Mississippi as of December 31, 2019 and Entergy Mississippi and Entergy Texas as of December 31, 2018.

Prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-12, Entergy measured its hedges for ineffectiveness.  Any ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings during the period.  The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges was recorded in competitive businesses operating revenues.  The change in fair value of Entergy’s cash flow hedges due to ineffectiveness was

and

($

for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Based on market prices as of

, unrealized gains (losses) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on cash flow hedges relating to power sales totaled

million

is expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to operating revenues in the next twelve months.  The actual amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income, however, could vary due to future changes in market prices.

Entergy may effectively liquidate a cash flow hedge instrument by entering into a contract offsetting the original hedge, and then de-designating the original hedge in this situation.  Gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income prior to de-designation continue to be deferred in other comprehensive income until they are included in income as the original hedged transaction occurs.  From the point of de-designation, the gains or losses on the original hedge and the offsetting contract are recorded as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and offset as they flow through to earnings.

Fair Values

The estimated fair values of Entergy’s financial instruments and derivatives are determined using historical prices, bid prices, market quotes, and financial modeling.  Considerable judgment is required in developing the estimates of fair value.  Therefore, estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that Entergy could realize in a current market exchange.  Gains or losses realized on financial instruments other than those instruments held by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are reflected in future rates and therefore do not affect net income.  Entergy considers the carrying amounts of most financial instruments classified as current assets and liabilities to be a reasonable estimate of their fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.

Accounting standards define fair value as an exit price, or the price that would be received to sell an asset or the amount that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable market participants at the date of measurement.  Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries use assumptions or market input data that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at fair value.  The inputs can be readily observable, corroborated by market data, or generally unobservable.  Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries endeavor to use the best available information to determine fair value.

Accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.  The hierarchy establishes the highest priority for unadjusted market quotes in an active market for the identical asset or liability and the lowest priority for unobservable inputs.

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:

•

Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.  Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  Level 1 primarily consists of individually owned common stocks, cash equivalents (temporary cash investments, securitization recovery trust account, and escrow accounts), debt instruments, and gas swaps traded on exchanges with active markets.  Cash equivalents includes all unrestricted highly liquid debt instruments with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.

•

Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are, either directly or indirectly, observable for the asset or liability at the measurement date.  Assets are valued based on prices derived by independent third parties that use inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and issuer spreads.  Prices are reviewed and can be challenged with the independent parties and/or overridden by Entergy if it is believed such would be more reflective of fair value.  Level 2 inputs include the following:

–

quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;

–

quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets;

–

inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or

–

inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

Level 2 consists primarily of individually-owned debt instruments and gas swaps and options valued using observable inputs.

•

Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are pricing inputs that are generally less observable or unobservable from objective sources.  These inputs are used with internally developed methodologies to produce management’s best estimate of fair value for the asset or liability.  Level 3 consists primarily of financial transmission rights and derivative power contracts used as cash flow hedges of power sales at merchant power plants.

The values for power contract assets or liabilities are based on both observable inputs including public market prices and interest rates, and unobservable inputs such as implied volatilities, unit contingent discounts, expected basis differences, and credit adjusted counterparty interest rates.  They are classified as Level 3 assets and liabilities.  The valuations of these assets and liabilities are performed by the Business Unit Risk Control group and the Accounting Policy and Entergy Wholesale Commodities Accounting group.  The primary functions of the Business Unit Risk Control group include: gathering, validating and reporting market data, providing market risk analyses and valuations in support of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ commercial transactions, developing and administering protocols for the management of market risks, and implementing and maintaining controls around changes to market data in the energy trading and risk management system.  The Business Unit Risk Control group is also responsible for managing the energy trading and risk management system, forecasting revenues, forward positions and analysis.  The Accounting Policy and Entergy Wholesale Commodities Accounting group performs functions related to market and counterparty settlements, revenue reporting and analysis and financial accounting.  The Business Unit Risk Control group reports to the Vice President and Treasurer while the Accounting Policy and Entergy Wholesale Commodities Accounting group reports to the Chief Accounting Officer.

The amounts reflected as the fair value of electricity swaps are based on the estimated amount that the contracts are in-the-money at the balance sheet date (treated as an asset) or out-of-the-money at the balance sheet date (treated as a liability) and would equal the estimated amount receivable to or payable by Entergy if the contracts were settled at that date.  These derivative contracts include cash flow hedges that swap fixed for floating cash flows for sales of the output from the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business.  The fair values are based on the mark-to-market comparison between the fixed contract prices and the floating prices determined each period from quoted forward power market prices.  The differences between the fixed price in the swap contract and these market-related prices multiplied by the volume specified in the contract and discounted at the counterparties’ credit adjusted risk free rate are recorded as derivative contract assets or liabilities.  For contracts that have unit contingent terms, a further discount is applied based on the historical relationship between contract and market prices for similar contract terms.

The amounts reflected as the fair values of electricity options are valued based on a Black Scholes model, and are calculated at the end of each month for accounting purposes.  Inputs to the valuation include end of day forward market prices for the period when the transactions will settle, implied volatilities based on market volatilities provided by a third-party data aggregator, and U.S. Treasury rates for a risk-free return rate.  As described further below, prices and implied volatilities are reviewed and can be adjusted if it is determined that there is a better representation of fair value.

On a daily basis, the Business Unit Risk Control group calculates the mark-to-market for electricity swaps and options.  The Business Unit Risk Control group also validates forward market prices by comparing them to other sources of forward market prices or to settlement prices of actual market transactions.  Significant differences are analyzed and potentially adjusted based on these other sources of forward market prices or settlement prices of actual market transactions.  Implied volatilities used to value options are also validated using actual counterparty quotes for Entergy Wholesale Commodities transactions when available and compared with other sources of market implied volatilities.  Moreover, on a quarterly basis, the Office of Corporate Risk Oversight confirms the mark-to-market calculations and prepares price scenarios and credit downgrade scenario analysis.  The scenario analysis is communicated to senior management within Entergy and within Entergy Wholesale Commodities.  Finally, for all proposed derivative transactions, an analysis is completed to assess the risk of adding the proposed derivative to Entergy



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

Wholesale Commodities’ portfolio.  In particular, the credit and liquidity effects are calculated for this analysis.  This analysis is communicated to senior management within Entergy and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.

The values of financial transmission rights are based on unobservable inputs, including estimates of congestion costs in MISO between applicable generation and load pricing nodes based on the 50th percentile of historical prices.  They are classified as Level 3 assets and liabilities.  The valuations of these assets and liabilities are performed by the Business Unit Risk Control group.  The values are calculated internally and verified against the data published by MISO.  Entergy’s Accounting Policy and Entergy Wholesale Commodities Accounting groups review these valuations for reasonableness, with the assistance of others within the organization with knowledge of the various inputs and assumptions used in the valuation.  The Business Unit Risk Control groups report to the Vice President and Treasurer.  The Accounting Policy and Entergy Wholesale Commodities Accounting groups report to the Chief Accounting Officer.

NOTE 16.

DECOMMISSIONING TRUST FUNDS (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy)

The NRC requires Entergy subsidiaries to maintain nuclear decommissioning trusts to fund the costs of decommissioning ANO 1, ANO 2, River Bend, Waterford 3, Grand Gulf, Indian Point 1, Indian Point 2, Indian Point 3, and Palisades.  Entergy’s nuclear decommissioning trust funds invest in equity securities, fixed-rate debt securities, and cash and cash equivalents.

Entergy implemented ASU No. 2016-01 “Financial Instruments (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” effective January 1, 2018.  The ASU requires investments in equity securities, excluding those accounted for under the equity method or resulting in consolidation of the investee, to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.  Entergy implemented this ASU using a modified retrospective method, and Entergy recorded an adjustment increasing retained earnings and increasing accumulated other comprehensive loss by

$


million

as of January 1, 2018, for the cumulative effect of the unrealized gains and losses on investments in equity securities held by the decommissioning trust funds that do not meet the criteria for regulatory accounting treatment.  Beginning in 2018, unrealized gains and losses on investments in equity securities held by the nuclear decommissioning trust funds are recorded in earnings as they occur rather than in other comprehensive income.  In accordance with the regulatory treatment of the decommissioning trust funds of the



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

Registrant Subsidiaries, an offsetting amount of unrealized gains/(losses) will continue to be recorded in other regulatory liabilities/assets.

As discussed in Note 14 to the financial statements, in January 2019, Entergy completed the transfer of the Vermont Yankee plant to NorthStar.  As part of the transaction, Entergy transferred the Vermont Yankee decommissioning trust fund to NorthStar.  As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of the decommissioning trust fund was

$


million

.

As discussed in Note 14 to the financial statements, in August 2019, Entergy completed the transfer of the Pilgrim plant to Holtec.  As part of the transaction, Entergy transferred the Pilgrim decommissioning trust fund to Holtec.  The disposition-date fair value of the decommissioning trust fund was approximately

$

1,030

million

.

Entergy records decommissioning trust funds on the balance sheet at their fair value.  Because of the ability of the Registrant Subsidiaries to recover decommissioning costs in rates and in accordance with the regulatory treatment for decommissioning trust funds, the Registrant Subsidiaries have recorded an offsetting amount of unrealized gains/(losses) on investment securities in other regulatory liabilities/assets.  For the


%

interest in River Bend formerly owned by Cajun, Entergy Louisiana records an offsetting amount in other deferred credits for the unrealized trust earnings not currently expected to be needed to decommission the plant.  Decommissioning trust funds for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants do not meet the criteria for regulatory accounting treatment.  Accordingly, unrealized gains/(losses) recorded on the equity securities in the trust funds are recognized in earnings.  Unrealized gains recorded on the available-for-sale debt securities in the trust funds are recognized in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders’ equity.  Unrealized losses (where cost exceeds fair market value) on the available-for-sale debt securities in the trust funds are also recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders’ equity unless the unrealized loss is other than temporary and therefore recorded in earnings.  A portion of Entergy’s decommissioning trust funds are held in a wholly-owned registered investment company, and unrealized gains and losses on both the equity and debt securities held in the registered investment company are recognized in earnings.  Generally, Entergy records gains and losses on its debt and equity securities using the specific identification method to determine the cost basis of its securities.

The unrealized gains/(losses) recognized during the year ended

December 31, 2019

on equity securities still held as of

December 31, 2019

were

$


million

.  The equity securities are generally held in funds that are designed to approximate or somewhat exceed the return of the Standard Poor’s 500 Index.  A relatively small percentage of the equity securities are held in funds intended to replicate the return of the Wilshire 4500 index or the Russell 3000 Index.  The debt securities are generally held in individual government and credit issuances.

Other-than-temporary impairments and unrealized gains and losses

Entergy evaluates the available-for-sale debt securities in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear decommissioning trust funds with unrealized losses at the end of each period to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred.  The assessment of whether an investment in a debt security has suffered an other-than-temporary impairment is based on whether Entergy has the intent to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized costs.  Further, if Entergy does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred and it is measured by the present value of cash flows expected to be collected less the amortized cost basis (credit loss).  Entergy did not have any material other-than-temporary impairments relating to credit losses on debt securities for the years ended

NOTE 17.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

Under applicable authoritative accounting guidance, a variable interest entity (VIE) is an entity that conducts a business or holds property that possesses any of the following characteristics: an insufficient amount of equity at risk to finance its activities, equity owners who do not have the power to direct the significant activities of the entity (or have voting rights that are disproportionate to their ownership interest), or where equity holders do not receive expected losses or returns.  An entity may have an interest in a VIE through ownership or other contractual rights or obligations, and is required to consolidate a VIE if it is the VIE’s primary beneficiary.  The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or has the right to residual returns that would potentially be significant to the entity.

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy consolidate the respective companies from which they lease nuclear fuel, usually in a sale and leaseback transaction.  This is because Entergy directs the nuclear fuel companies with respect to nuclear fuel purchases, assists the nuclear fuel companies in obtaining financing, and, if financing cannot be arranged, the lessee (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, or System Energy) is responsible to repurchase nuclear fuel to allow the nuclear fuel company (the VIE) to meet its obligations.  During the term of the



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

arrangements, none of the Entergy operating companies have been required to provide financial support apart from their scheduled lease payments.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for details of the nuclear fuel companies’ credit facility and commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt that are reported by Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy.  These amounts also represent Entergy’s and the respective Registrant Subsidiary’s maximum exposure to losses associated with their respective interests in the nuclear fuel companies.

Entergy Gulf States Reconstruction Funding I, LLC, and Entergy Texas Restoration Funding, LLC, companies wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Texas, are variable interest entities and Entergy Texas is the primary beneficiary.  In June 2007, Entergy Gulf States Reconstruction Funding issued senior secured transition bonds (securitization bonds) to finance Entergy Texas’s Hurricane Rita reconstruction costs.  In November 2009, Entergy Texas Restoration Funding issued senior secured transition bonds (securitization bonds) to finance Entergy Texas’s Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav restoration costs.  With the proceeds, the variable interest entities purchased from Entergy Texas the transition property, which is the right to recover from customers through a transition charge amounts sufficient to service the securitization bonds.  The transition property is reflected as a regulatory asset on the consolidated Entergy Texas balance sheet.  The creditors of Entergy Texas do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of the variable interest entities, including the transition property, and the creditors of the variable interest entities do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy Texas.  Entergy Texas has no payment obligations to the variable interest entities except to remit transition charge collections.  See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional details regarding the securitization bonds.

Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Arkansas, is a variable interest entity and Entergy Arkansas is the primary beneficiary.  In August 2010, Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding issued storm cost recovery bonds to finance Entergy Arkansas’s January 2009 ice storm damage restoration costs.  With the proceeds, Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding purchased from Entergy Arkansas the storm recovery property, which is the right to recover from customers through a storm recovery charge amounts sufficient to service the securitization bonds.  The storm recovery property is reflected as a regulatory asset on the consolidated Entergy Arkansas balance sheet.  The creditors of Entergy Arkansas do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, including the storm recovery property, and the creditors of Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy Arkansas.  Entergy Arkansas has no payment obligations to Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding except to remit storm recovery charge collections.  See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional details regarding the storm cost recovery bonds.

Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding I, L.L.C., a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Louisiana, is a variable interest entity and Entergy Louisiana is the primary beneficiary.  In September 2011, Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding issued investment recovery bonds to recover Entergy Louisiana’s investment recovery costs associated with the canceled Little Gypsy repowering project.  With the proceeds, Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding purchased from Entergy Louisiana the investment recovery property, which is the right to recover from customers through an investment recovery charge amounts sufficient to service the bonds.  The investment recovery property is reflected as a regulatory asset on the consolidated Entergy Louisiana balance sheet.  The creditors of Entergy Louisiana do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding, including the investment recovery property, and the creditors of Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy Louisiana.  Entergy Louisiana has no payment obligations to Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding except to remit investment recovery charge collections.  See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional details regarding the investment recovery bonds.

Entergy New Orleans Storm Recovery Funding I, L.L.C., a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy New Orleans, is a variable interest entity, and Entergy New Orleans is the primary beneficiary.  In July 2015, Entergy New Orleans Storm Recovery Funding issued storm cost recovery bonds to recover Entergy New Orleans’s Hurricane Isaac storm restoration costs, including carrying costs, the costs of funding and replenishing the storm recovery reserve, and up-front financing costs associated with the securitization.  With the proceeds, Entergy New Orleans Storm Recovery Funding purchased from Entergy New Orleans the storm recovery property, which is the right to recover from customers through a storm recovery charge amounts sufficient to service the securitization bonds.  The

Notes to Financial Statements

storm recovery property is reflected as a regulatory asset on the consolidated Entergy New Orleans balance sheet.  The creditors of Entergy New Orleans do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy New Orleans Storm Recovery Funding, including the storm recovery property, and the creditors of Entergy New Orleans Storm Recovery Funding do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy New Orleans.  Entergy New Orleans has no payment obligations to Entergy New Orleans Storm Recovery Funding except to remit storm recovery charge collections.  See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional details regarding the securitization bonds.

System Energy is considered to hold a variable interest in the lessor from which it leases an undivided interest in the Grand Gulf nuclear plant.  System Energy is the lessee under this arrangement, which is described in more detail in Note 10 to the financial statements.  System Energy made payments on its lease, including interest, of

$

17.2

million

in 2019,

$

17.2

million

in 2018, and

$

17.2

million

in 2017.  The lessor is a bank acting in the capacity of owner trustee for the benefit of equity investors in the transaction pursuant to trust agreement entered solely for the purpose of facilitating the lease transaction.  It is possible that System Energy may be considered as the primary beneficiary of the lessor, but it is unable to apply the authoritative accounting guidance with respect to this VIE because the lessor is not required to, and could not, provide the necessary financial information to consolidate the lessor.  Because System Energy accounts for this leasing arrangement as a capital financing, however, System Energy believes that consolidating the lessor would not materially affect the financial statements.  In the unlikely event of default under a lease, remedies available to the lessor include payment by the lessee of the fair value of the undivided interest in the plant, payment of the present value of the basic rent payments, or payment of a predetermined casualty value.  System Energy believes, however, that the obligations recorded on the balance sheet materially represent its potential exposure to loss.

Entergy has also reviewed various lease arrangements, power purchase agreements, including agreements for renewable power, and other agreements that represent variable interests in other legal entities which have been determined to be variable interest entities.  In these cases, Entergy has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the related VIE because it does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance, or it does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to residual returns that would potentially be significant to the entity, or both.

REVENUE (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

Entergy implemented ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” effective January 1, 2018.  Topic 606 requires entities to “recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.”  The ASU details a five-step model that should be followed to achieve the core principle.  This accounting was applied to all contracts using the modified retrospective method, which requires an adjustment to retained earnings for the cumulative effect of adopting the standard as of the effective date.  Because the standard did not result in any material change in Entergy’s revenue recognition no adjustment to retained earnings was required upon implementation.  Similarly, there was no effect on revenues recognized under Topic 606 for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Revenues from electric service and the sale of natural gas are recognized when services are transferred to the customer in an amount equal to what Entergy has the right to bill the customer because this amount represents the value of services provided to customers.

The Registrant Subsidiaries’ total revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2018

were as follows:

(a)

Sales for resale and competitive businesses sales include day-ahead sales of energy in a market administered by an ISO.  These sales represent financially binding commitments for the sale of physical energy the next day.  These sales are adjusted to actual power generated and delivered in the real time market.  Given the short duration of these transactions, Entergy does not consider them to be derivatives subject to fair value adjustments, and includes them as part of customer revenues.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

(b)

Other electric revenues consist primarily of transmission and ancillary services provided to participants of an ISO-administered market and unbilled revenue.

(c)

Other revenues include the settlement of financial hedges, occasional sales of inventory, alternative revenue programs, provisions for revenue subject to refund, and late fees.

Electric Revenues

Entergy’s primary source of revenue is from retail electric sales sold under tariff rates approved by regulators in its various jurisdictions.  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas generate, transmit, and distribute electric power primarily to retail customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.  Entergy’s Utility operating companies provide power to customers on demand throughout the month, measured by a meter located at the customer’s property.  Approved rates vary by customer class due to differing requirements of the customers and market factors involved in fulfilling those requirements.  Entergy issues monthly bills to customers at rates approved by regulators for power and related services provided during the previous billing cycle.

To the extent that deliveries have occurred but a bill has not been issued, Entergy’s Utility operating companies record an estimate for energy delivered since the latest billings.  The Utility operating companies calculate the estimate based upon several factors including billings through the last billing cycle in a month, actual generation in the month, historical line loss factors, and market prices of power in the respective jurisdiction.  The inputs are revised as needed to approximate actual usage and cost.  Each month, estimated unbilled amounts are recorded as unbilled revenue and accounts receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed.  Price and volume differences resulting from factors such as weather affect the calculation of unbilled revenues from one period to the other.

Entergy may record revenue based on rates that are subject to refund.  Such revenues are reduced by estimated refund amounts when Entergy believes refunds are probable based on the status of rate proceedings as of the date financial statements are prepared.  Because these refunds will be made through a reduction in future rates, and not as a reduction in bills previously issued, they are presented as other revenues in the table above.

System Energy’s only source of revenue is the sale of electric power and capacity generated from its


%

interest in the Grand Gulf nuclear plant to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.  System Energy issues monthly bills to its affiliated customers equal to its actual operating costs plus a return on common equity approved by the FERC.

Entergy’s Utility operating companies also sell excess power not needed for its own customers, primarily through transactions with MISO, a regional transmission organization that maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and manages one of the largest energy markets in the U.S.  In the MISO market, Entergy offers its generation and bids its load into the market.  MISO settles these offers and bids based on locational marginal prices.  These represent pricing for energy at a given location based on a market clearing price that takes into account physical limitations on the transmission system, generation, and demand throughout the MISO region.  MISO evaluates each market participant’s energy offers and demand bids to economically and reliably dispatch the entire MISO system.  Entergy nets purchases and sales within the MISO market and reports in operating revenues when in a net selling position and in operating expenses when in a net purchasing position.

Natural Gas

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans also distribute natural gas to retail customers in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana, respectively.  Gas transferred to customers is measured by a meter at the customer’s property.  Entergy issues monthly invoices to customers at rates approved by regulators for the volume of gas transferred to date.



Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Financial Statements

Competitive Businesses Revenues

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment derives almost all of its revenue from sales of electric power and capacity produced by its operating plants to wholesale customers.  The majority of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ revenues are from Entergy’s nuclear power plants located in the northern United States.  Entergy issues monthly invoices to the counterparties for these electric sales at the respective contracted or ISO market rate of electricity and related services provided during the previous month.

Most of the Palisades nuclear plant output is sold under a 15-year PPA with Consumers Energy, executed as part of the acquisition of the plant in 2007 and expiring in 2022.  Prices under the PPA range from

$

43.50

/MWh in 2007 to

$

61.50

/MWh in 2022, and the average price under the PPA is

$


/MWh.  Entergy issues monthly invoices to Consumers Energy for electric sales based on the actual output of electricity and related services provided during the previous month at the contract price.  The PPA was at below-market prices at the time of the acquisition and Entergy amortizes a liability to revenue over the life of the agreement.  The amount amortized each period is based upon the present value, calculated at the date of acquisition, of each year’s difference between revenue under the agreement and revenue based on estimated market prices.  Amounts amortized to revenue were

$


million

in


,

$


million

in


, and

$

.  Amounts to be amortized to revenue through the remaining life of the agreement will be approximately

$


million

in 2020,

$


million

in 2021, and

$


million

in 2022.

Practical Expedients and Exceptions

Entergy has elected not to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, or for revenue recognized in an amount equal to what Entergy has the right to bill the customer for services performed.

Most of Entergy’s contracts, except in a few cases where there are defined minimums or stated terms, are on demand.  This results in customer bills that vary each month based on an approved tariff and usage.  Entergy imposes monthly or annual minimum requirements on some customers primarily as credit and cost recovery guarantees and not as pricing for unsatisfied performance obligations.  These minimums typically expire after the initial term or when specified costs have been recovered. The minimum amounts are part of each month’s bill and recognized as revenue accordingly.  Some of the subsidiaries within the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment have operations and maintenance services contracts that have fixed components and terms longer than one year.  The total fixed consideration related to these unsatisfied performance obligations, however, is not material to Entergy revenues.

Recovery of Fuel Costs

Entergy’s Utility operating companies’ rate schedules include either fuel adjustment clauses or fixed fuel factors, which allow either current recovery in billings to customers or deferral of fuel costs until the costs are billed to customers.  Where the fuel component of revenues is based on a pre-determined fuel cost (fixed fuel factor), the fuel factor remains in effect until changed as part of a general rate case, fuel reconciliation, or fixed fuel factor filing. System Energy’s operating revenues are intended to recover from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans operating expenses and capital costs attributable to Grand Gulf.  The capital costs are based on System Energy’s common equity funds allocable to its net investment in Grand Gulf, plus System Energy’s effective interest cost for its debt allocable to its investment in Grand Gulf.

Taxes Imposed on Revenue-Producing Transactions

Governmental authorities assess taxes that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer, including, but not limited to, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes.  Entergy presents these taxes on a net basis, excluding them from revenues.

Strategy

Entergy’s strategy is to operate and grow a world-class utility business that creates sustainable value for its customers, employees, communities, and owners.  Entergy’s current scope includes electricity generation, transmission, and distribution as well as natural gas distribution.  Entergy focuses on operational excellence with an emphasis on safety, reliability, customer service, sustainability, cost efficiency, risk management, and engaged employees.  Entergy also continually seeks opportunities to grow its utility business to benefit all stakeholders and to optimize its portfolio of assets in an ever-dynamic market.  The Utility business segment will continue to modernize its operations, maintain reliability, and better serve its customers while growing the business.  The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business segment will continue to manage the risk of its operating portfolio as Entergy completes its exit from the merchant power business.

Utility

The Utility business segment includes five retail electric utility subsidiaries: Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas.  These companies generate, transmit, distribute, and sell electric power to retail and wholesale customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.  Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans also provide natural gas utility services to customers in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana, respectively.  Also included in the Utility is System Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation that owns or leases 90 percent of Grand Gulf.  System Energy sells its power and capacity from Grand Gulf at wholesale to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.  The five retail utility subsidiaries are each regulated by the FERC and by state utility commissions, or, in the case of Entergy New Orleans, the City Council.  System Energy is regulated by the FERC because all of its transactions are at wholesale.  The overall generation portfolio of the Utility, which relies heavily on natural gas and nuclear generation, is consistent with Entergy’s strong support for the environment.

Entergy Arkansas

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery

Entergy Arkansas’s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased power costs in monthly bills.  The rider utilizes prior calendar year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy cost for the prior calendar year.  The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs.  In December 2007 the APSC issued an order stating that Entergy Arkansas’s energy cost recovery rider will remain in effect, and any future termination of the rider would be subject to eighteen months advance notice by the APSC, which would occur following notice and hearing.

Entergy Louisiana

Fuel Recovery

Entergy Louisiana’s rate schedules include a fuel adjustment clause designed to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power costs.  The fuel adjustment clause contains a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense and related carrying charges arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of proceedings related to audits of Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause filings.

To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Louisiana received approval from the LPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments.  Entergy Louisiana hedges approximately one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year.  The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis.  In January 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC to suspend these seasonal hedging programs and implement financial hedges with terms up to five years for a portion of its natural gas exposure, which was approved in November 2018.

Entergy Louisiana’s gas rates include a purchased gas adjustment clause based on estimated gas costs for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

Retail Rates - Gas

In accordance with the settlement of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2012, in August 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana submitted for consideration a proposal for implementation of an infrastructure rider to recover expenditures associated with strategic plant investment and relocation projects mandated by local governments.  After review by the LPSC staff and inclusion of certain customer safeguards required by the LPSC staff, in December 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted a joint settlement for implementation of an accelerated gas pipe replacement program providing for the replacement of approximately 100 miles of pipe over the next ten years, as well as relocation of certain existing pipe resulting from local government-related infrastructure projects, and for a rider to recover the investment associated with these projects.  The rider allows for recovery of approximately $65 million over ten years.  The rider recovery will be adjusted on a quarterly basis to include actual investment incurred for the prior quarter and is subject to the following conditions,



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

among others:  a ten-year term; application of any earnings in excess of the upper end of the earnings band as an offset to the revenue requirement of the infrastructure rider; adherence to a specified spending plan, within plus or minus 20% annually; annual filings comparing actual versus planned rider spending with actual spending and explanation of variances exceeding 10%; and an annual true-up.  The joint settlement was approved by the LPSC in January 2015.  Implementation of the infrastructure rider commenced with bills rendered on and after the first billing cycle of April 2015.

Storm Cost Recovery

See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy Louisiana’s filings to recover storm-related costs.

Other

In March 2016 the LPSC opened two dockets to examine, on a generic basis, issues that it identified in connection with its review of Cleco Corporation’s acquisition by third party investors.  The first docket is captioned “In re: Investigation of double leveraging issues for all LPSC-jurisdictional utilities,” and the second is captioned “In re: Investigation of tax structure issues for all LPSC-jurisdictional utilities.”  In April 2016 the LPSC clarified that the concerns giving rise to the two dockets arose as a result of its review of the structure of the Cleco-Macquarie transaction and that the specific intent of the directives is to seek more information regarding intra-corporate debt financing of a utility’s capital structure as well as the use of investment tax credits to mitigate the tax obligation at the parent level of a consolidated entity.  No schedule has been set for either docket, and limited discovery has occurred.

In December 2019 an LPSC commissioner issued an unopposed directive to staff to research customer-centered options for all customer classes, as well as other regulatory environments, and recommend a plan for how to ensure customers are the focus.  There was no opposition to the directive from other commissioners but several remarked that the intent of the directive was not initiated to pursue retail open access.  In furtherance of the directive, the LPSC issued a notice of the opening of a docket to conduct a rulemaking to research and evaluate customer-centered options for all electric customer classes as well as other regulatory environments in January 2020.

Entergy Mississippi

Fuel Recovery

Entergy Mississippi’s rate schedules include energy cost recovery riders to recover fuel and purchased power costs.  The energy cost rate for each calendar year is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery of the energy costs as of the 12-month period ended September 30.  Entergy Mississippi’s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC.

To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Mississippi received approval from the MPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments.  Entergy Mississippi hedges approximately one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year.  The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis.

Storm Cost Recovery

Formula Rate Plan

In August 2012 the MPSC opened inquiries to review whether the current formulaic methodology used to calculate the return on common equity in both Entergy Mississippi’s formula rate plan and Mississippi Power Company’s annual formula rate plan was still appropriate or could be improved to better serve the public interest. The intent of this inquiry and review was for informational purposes only; the evaluation of any recommendations for changes to the existing methodology would take place in a general rate case or in the existing formula rate plan proceeding. In March 2013 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed its consultant’s report which noted the return on common equity estimation methods used by Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company are commonly used throughout the electric utility industry.  The report suggested ways in which the methods used by Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company might be improved, but did not recommend specific changes in the return on common equity formulas or calculations at that time.  In June 2014 the MPSC expanded the scope of the August 2012 inquiry to study the merits of adopting a uniform formula rate plan that could be applied, where possible in whole or in part, to both Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company in order to achieve greater consistency in the plans.  The MPSC directed the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff to investigate and review Entergy Mississippi’s formula rate plan rider schedule and Mississippi Power Company’s Performance Evaluation Plan by considering the merits and deficiencies and possibilities for improvement of each and then to propose a uniform formula rate plan that, where possible, could be applicable to both companies.  No procedural schedule has been set.  In October 2014 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff conducted a public technical conference to discuss performance benchmarking and its potential application to the electric utilities’ formula rate plans.  The docket remains open.

Entergy New Orleans

Fuel Recovery

Entergy New Orleans’s electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

Entergy New Orleans’s gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges.

To help stabilize gas costs, Entergy New Orleans seeks approval annually from the City Council to continue implementation of its natural gas hedging program consistent with the City Council’s stated policy objectives.  The program uses financial instruments to hedge exposure to volatility in the wholesale price of natural gas purchased to serve Entergy New Orleans gas customers.  Entergy New Orleans hedges up to 25% of actual gas sales made during the winter months.

Storm Cost Recovery

See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy New Orleans’s efforts to recover storm-related costs.

Entergy Texas

Fuel Recovery

Entergy Texas’s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including interest, that are not included in base rates.  Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix.  The amounts collected under Entergy



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Texas’s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT.  The PUCT fuel cost proceedings are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.

At the PUCT’s April 2013 open meeting, the PUCT Commissioners discussed their view that a purchased power capacity rider was good public policy.  The PUCT issued an order in May 2013 adopting the rule allowing for a purchased power capacity rider, subject to an offsetting adjustment for load growth.  The rule, as adopted, also includes a process for obtaining pre-approval by the PUCT of purchased power agreements.  Entergy Texas has not exercised the option to recover its capacity costs under the new rider mechanism, but will continue to evaluate the benefits of utilizing the new rider to recover future capacity costs.

Electric Industry Restructuring

In June 2009, a law was enacted in Texas that required Entergy Texas to cease all activities relating to Entergy Texas’s transition to competition.  The law allows Entergy Texas to remain a part of the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC) Region, although it does not prevent Entergy Texas from joining another power region.  The law provides that proceedings to certify a power region that Entergy Texas belongs to as a qualified power region can be initiated by the PUCT, or on motion by another party, when the conditions supporting such a proceeding exist.  Under the law, the PUCT may not approve a transition to competition plan for Entergy Texas until the expiration of four years from the PUCT’s certification of Entergy Texas’s power region.

The law also contains provisions that allow Entergy Texas to take advantage of a cost recovery mechanism that permits annual filings for the recovery of reasonable and necessary expenditures for transmission infrastructure improvement and changes in wholesale transmission charges.  This mechanism was previously available to other non-ERCOT Texas utility companies, but not to Entergy Texas.

The law further amended already existing law that had required Entergy Texas to propose for PUCT approval a tariff to allow eligible customers the ability to contract for competitive generation.  The amending language in the law provides, among other things, that:  1) the tariff shall not be implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers who choose not to participate in the tariff; 2) Entergy Texas shall “purchase competitive generation service, selected by the customer, and provide the generation at retail to the customer;” and 3) Entergy Texas shall provide and price transmission service and ancillary services under that tariff at a rate that is unbundled from its cost of service.  The law directs that the PUCT may not issue an order on the tariff that is contrary to an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction.

The PUCT determined that unrecovered costs that may be recovered through the rider consist only of those costs necessary to implement and administer the competitive generation program and do not include lost revenues or embedded generation costs.  The amount of customer load that may be included in the competitive generation service program is limited to 115 MW.

In September 2011 the PUCT adopted a proposed rule implementing a distribution cost recovery factor to recover capital and capital-related costs related to distribution infrastructure.  The distribution cost recovery factor permits utilities once per year to implement an increase or decrease in rates above or below amounts reflected in base rates to reflect depreciation expense, federal income tax and other taxes, and return on investment.  The distribution cost recovery factor rider may be changed a maximum of four times between base rate cases.

In September 2019 the PUCT initiated a rulemaking to promulgate a generation cost recovery factor rule, implementing legislation passed in the 2019 Texas legislative session intended to allow electric utilities to recover generation investments between base rate proceedings.  The draft rule was approved for publication at the PUCT’s February 2020 open meeting, and two rounds of public comment will be taken in March and April 2020.  The PUCT is expected to approve a final rule within six months of publication.

Franchises

Entergy Arkansas holds exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 308 incorporated cities and towns in Arkansas.  These franchises are unlimited in duration and continue unless the municipalities purchase the utility property.  In Arkansas franchises are considered to be contracts and, therefore, are terminable pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement and applicable statutes.

Entergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 175 incorporated municipalities and in the unincorporated areas of approximately 59 parishes of Louisiana.  Entergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide natural gas service to customers in the City of Baton Rouge and in East Baton Rouge Parish.  Municipal franchise agreement terms range from 25 to 60 years while parish franchise terms range from 25 to 99 years.

Entergy Mississippi has received from the MPSC certificates of public convenience and necessity to provide electric service to areas within 45 counties, including a number of municipalities, in western Mississippi.  Under Mississippi statutory law, such certificates are exclusive.  Entergy Mississippi may continue to serve in such municipalities upon payment of a statutory franchise fee, regardless of whether an original municipal franchise is still in existence.

Entergy New Orleans provides electric and gas service in the City of New Orleans pursuant to indeterminate permits set forth in city ordinances.  These ordinances contain a continuing option for the City of New Orleans to purchase Entergy New Orleans’s electric and gas utility properties.

Entergy Texas holds a certificate of convenience and necessity from the PUCT to provide electric service to areas within approximately 27 counties in eastern Texas, and holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 68 incorporated municipalities.  Entergy Texas typically obtains 25-year franchise agreements as existing agreements expire.  Entergy Texas’s electric franchises expire over the period 2020-2058.

The business of System Energy is limited to wholesale power sales.  It has no distribution franchises.

Summer peak load for the Utility has averaged 21,636 MW over the previous decade.

The Utility operating companies’ load and capacity projections are reviewed periodically to assess the need and timing for additional generating capacity and interconnections.  These reviews consider existing and projected demand, the availability and price of power, the location of new load, the economy, environmental regulations, public policy goals, and the age and condition of Entergy’s existing infrastructure.

The Utility operating companies’ long-term resource strategy (Portfolio Transformation Strategy) calls for the bulk of capacity needs to be met through long-term resources, whether owned or contracted.  Over the past decade, the Portfolio Transformation Strategy has resulted in the addition of about 7,314 MW of new long-term resources and the deactivation of over 4,465 MW of legacy generation.  As MISO market participants, the Utility operating companies also participate in MISO’s Day Ahead and Real Time Energy and Ancillary Services markets to economically dispatch generation and purchase energy to serve customers reliably and at the lowest reasonable cost.

Other Generation Resources

RFP Procurements

The Utility operating companies from time to time issue requests for proposals (RFP) to procure supply-side resources from sources other than the spot market to meet the unique regional needs of the Utility operating companies.  The RFPs issued by the Utility operating companies have sought resources needed to meet near-term MISO reliability requirements as well as longer-term requirements through a broad range of wholesale power products, including limited-term (1 to 3 years) and long-term contractual products and asset acquisitions.

As a Regional Transmission Organization, MISO assures consumers of unbiased regional grid management and open access to the transmission facilities under MISO’s functional supervision.  In addition, the Utility operating companies are members of SERC.  SERC is a nonprofit corporation responsible for promoting and improving the reliability, adequacy, and critical infrastructure of the bulk power supply systems in all or portions of 16 central and southeastern states.

SERC serves as a regional entity with delegated authority from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) for the purpose of proposing and enforcing reliability standards within the SERC Region.

Gas Property

As of

December 31, 2019

, Entergy New Orleans distributed and transported natural gas for distribution within New Orleans, Louisiana, through approximately 2,600 miles of gas pipeline.  As of December 31, 2019, the gas properties of Entergy Louisiana, which are located in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were not material to Entergy Louisiana’s financial position.

Title

The Utility operating companies’ generating stations are generally located on properties owned in fee simple.  Most of the substations and transmission and distribution lines are constructed on private property or public



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

rights-of-way pursuant to easements, servitudes, or appropriate franchises.  Some substation properties are owned in fee simple.  The Utility operating companies generally have the right of eminent domain, whereby they may perfect title to, or secure easements or servitudes on, private property for their utility operations.

Substantially all of the physical properties and assets owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy are subject to the liens of mortgages securing bonds issued by those companies.  The Lewis Creek generating station of Entergy Texas was acquired by merger with a subsidiary of Entergy Texas and is currently not subject to the lien of the Entergy Texas indenture.

Fuel Supply

The sources of generation and average fuel cost per kWh for the Utility operating companies and System Energy for the years 2017-2019 were:

Actual 2019 and projected 2020 sources of generation for the Utility operating companies and System Energy, including certain power purchases from affiliates under life of unit power purchase agreements, including the Unit Power Sales Agreement, are:

(a)

Hydroelectric power provided less than 1% of Entergy Arkansas’s generation in 2019 and is expected to provide less than 1% of its generation in 2020.

(b)

Solar power provided less than 1% of Entergy Mississippi’s and Entergy New Orleans's generation in 2019 and is expected to provide less than 1% of each of Entergy Mississippi’s and Entergy New Orleans's generation in 2020.

(c)

Capacity and energy from System Energy’s interest in Grand Gulf is allocated as follows under the Unit Power Sales Agreement: Entergy Arkansas - 36%; Entergy Louisiana - 14%; Entergy Mississippi - 33%; and Entergy New Orleans - 17%.  Pursuant to purchased power agreements, Entergy Arkansas is selling a portion of its owned capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.

(d)

Excludes MISO purchases.

(e)

In December 2013, Entergy integrated its transmission system into the MISO RTO.  Entergy offers all of its generation into the MISO energy market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the MISO energy market to serve the demand of its customers, with MISO making dispatch decisions.  The MISO purchases metric provided for 2019 is not projected for 2020.



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Some of the Utility’s gas-fired plants are also capable of using fuel oil, if necessary.  Although based on current economics the Utility does not expect fuel oil use in 2020, it is possible that various operational events including weather or pipeline maintenance may require the use of fuel oil.

Natural Gas

The Utility operating companies have long-term firm and short-term interruptible gas contracts for both supply and transportation.  Over 50% of the Utility operating companies’ power plants maintain some level of long-term firm transportation.  Short-term contracts and spot-market purchases satisfy additional gas requirements.  Entergy Texas owns a gas storage facility that provides reliable and flexible natural gas service to certain generating stations.

Many factors, including wellhead deliverability, storage, pipeline capacity, and demand requirements of end users, influence the availability and price of natural gas supplies for power plants.  Demand is primarily tied to weather conditions as well as to the prices and availability of other energy sources.  Pursuant to federal and state regulations, gas supplies to power plants may be interrupted during periods of shortage.  To the extent natural gas supplies are disrupted or natural gas prices significantly increase, the Utility operating companies may in some instances use alternate fuels, such as oil when available, or rely to a larger extent on coal, nuclear generation, and purchased power.

Coal

Entergy Arkansas has committed to seven one- to three-year and two spot contracts that will supply approximately 85% of the total coal supply needs in 2020.  These contracts are staggered in term so that not all contracts have to be renewed the same year.  The remaining 15% of total coal requirements will be satisfied by contracts with a term of less than one year.  Based on continued improved Powder River Basin (PRB) coal deliveries by rail and the high cost of alternate sources and modes of transportation, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Entergy Arkansas during 2020.  Coal will be transported to Arkansas via an existing transportation agreement that is expected to provide all of Entergy Arkansas’s rail transportation requirements for 2020.

Entergy Louisiana has committed to four one- to three-year contracts that will supply approximately 90% of Nelson Unit 6 coal needs in 2020.  If needed, additional PRB coal will be purchased through contracts with a term of less than one year to provide the remaining supply needs.  For the same reasons as for Entergy Arkansas’s plants, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Nelson Unit 6 during 2020.  Coal will be transported to Nelson primarily via an existing transportation agreement that is expected to provide all of Entergy Louisiana’s rail transportation requirements for 2020.

For the year 2019, coal transportation delivery rates to Entergy Arkansas-and Entergy Louisiana-operated coal-fired units were satisfactory to meet supply needs and obligations.  Delivery rates improved in the second half of the year as track restoration efforts were completed by the railroads following spring flooding events, although flooding impacts were overall inconsequential to the companies’ coal operations.  Both Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana control a sufficient number of railcars to satisfy the rail transportation requirement.

The operator of Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3, Louisiana Generating, LLC, has advised Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas that it has adequate rail car and barge capacity to meet the volumes of PRB coal requested for 2020.  Entergy Louisiana’s and Entergy Texas’s coal nomination requests to Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3 are made on an annual basis.

Nuclear Fuel

The nuclear fuel cycle consists of the following:

•

mining and milling of uranium ore to produce a concentrate;

•

conversion of the concentrate to uranium hexafluoride gas;



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

•

enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride gas;

•

fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies for use in fueling nuclear reactors; and

•

disposal of spent fuel.

The Registrant Subsidiaries that own nuclear plants, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, are responsible through a shared regulated uranium pool for contracts to acquire nuclear material to be used in fueling Entergy’s Utility nuclear units.  These companies own the materials and services in this shared regulated uranium pool on a pro rata fractional basis determined by the nuclear generation capability of each company.  Any liabilities for obligations of the pooled contracts are on a several but not joint basis.  The shared regulated uranium pool maintains inventories of nuclear materials during the various stages of processing.  The Registrant Subsidiaries purchase enriched uranium hexafluoride for their nuclear plant reload requirements at the average inventory cost from the shared regulated uranium pool.  Entergy Operations, Inc. contracts separately for the fabrication of nuclear fuel as agent on behalf of each of the Registrant Subsidiaries that owns a nuclear plant.  All contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel are between the DOE and the owner of a nuclear power plant.

Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, the Utility nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable or fixed prices through most of 2023. Entergy’s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners.  There are a number of possible supply alternatives that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, including potentially drawing upon Entergy’s inventory intended for later generation periods depending upon its risk management strategy at that time, although the pricing of any alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time.  In addition, some nuclear fuel contracts are on a non-fixed price basis subject to prevailing prices at the time of delivery.

The effects of market price changes may be reduced and deferred by risk management strategies, such as negotiation of floor and ceiling amounts for long-term contracts, buying for inventory or entering into forward physical contracts at fixed prices when Entergy believes it is appropriate and useful.  Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S.

Entergy’s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers.  There are fewer of these providers than for uranium.  For conversion and enrichment services, like uranium, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures as needed to ensure supply of enriched uranium for the reliable fabrication of nuclear fuel.  For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the effective performance of the fabricator of that plant’s nuclear fuel, therefore, Entergy provides additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight for the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality.

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy each have made arrangements to lease nuclear fuel and related equipment and services.  The lessors, which are consolidated in the financial statements of Entergy and the applicable Registrant Subsidiary, finance the acquisition and ownership of nuclear fuel through credit agreements and the issuance of notes.  These credit facilities are subject to periodic renewal, and the notes are issued periodically, typically for terms between three and seven years.

Natural Gas Purchased for Resale

Entergy New Orleans has several suppliers of natural gas.  Its system is interconnected with one interstate and three intrastate pipelines.  Entergy New Orleans has a “no-notice” service gas purchase contract with CenterPoint Energy Services which guarantees Entergy New Orleans gas delivery at specific delivery points and at any volume within the minimum and maximum set forth in the contract amounts.  The CenterPoint Energy Service gas supply is



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

transported to Entergy New Orleans pursuant to a transportation service agreement with Gulf South Pipeline Co.  This service is subject to FERC-approved rates.  Entergy New Orleans also makes interruptible spot market purchases.

Entergy Louisiana purchased natural gas for resale in 2019 under a firm contract from Sequent Energy Management L.P.  The gas is delivered through a combination of intrastate and interstate pipelines.

As a result of the implementation of FERC-mandated interstate pipeline restructuring in 1993, curtailments of interstate gas supply could occur if Entergy Louisiana’s or Entergy New Orleans’s suppliers failed to perform their obligations to deliver gas under their supply agreements.  Gulf South Pipeline Co. could curtail transportation capacity only in the event of pipeline system constraints.

Federal Regulation of the Utility

State or local regulatory authorities, as described above, regulate the retail rates of the Utility operating companies.  The FERC regulates wholesale sales of electricity rates and interstate transmission of electricity, including System Energy’s sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of federal regulation proceedings.

System Agreement

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

Prior to each operating company’s termination of participation in the System Agreement (Entergy Arkansas in December 2013, Entergy Mississippi in November 2015, and Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas each in August 2016), the Utility operating companies engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which was a rate schedule approved by the FERC.  Under the terms of the System Agreement, generating capacity and other power resources were jointly operated by the Utility operating companies that were participating in the System Agreement.  The System Agreement provided, among other things, that parties having generating reserves greater than their allocated share of reserves (long companies) would receive payments from those parties having generating reserves that were less than their allocated share of reserves (short companies).  Such payments were at amounts sufficient to cover certain of the long companies’ costs for intermediate and peaking oil/gas-fired generation, including operating expenses, fixed charges on debt, dividend requirements on preferred equity, and a fair rate of return on common equity investment.  Under the System Agreement, the rates used to compensate long companies were based on costs associated with the long companies’ steam electric generating units fueled by oil or gas and having an annual average heat rate above 10,000 Btu/kWh.  In addition, for all energy exchanged among the Utility operating companies under the System Agreement, the companies purchasing exchange energy were required to pay the cost of fuel consumed in generating such energy plus a charge to cover other associated costs.

Although the System Agreement has terminated, certain of the Utility operating companies’ and their retail regulators are pursuing litigation involving the System Agreement at the FERC and in federal courts.  The proceedings include challenges to the allocation of costs as defined by the System Agreement and other matters.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of legal proceedings at the FERC and in federal courts involving the System Agreement.

Transmission and MISO Markets

In December 2013 the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO.  Although becoming a member of MISO did not affect the ownership by the Utility operating companies of their transmission facilities or the responsibility for maintaining those facilities, MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies.  MISO also exercises functional control of transmission



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

planning and congestion management and provides schedules and pricing for the commitment and dispatch of generation that is offered into MISO’s markets, as well as pricing for load that bids into the markets.  The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market rules.  Each Utility operating company has its own transmission pricing zone and a formula rate template (included as Attachment O to the MISO tariff) used to establish transmission rates within MISO.  The terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, are subject to regulation by the FERC.

System Energy and Related Agreements

System Energy recovers costs related to its interest in Grand Gulf through rates charged to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans for capacity and energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement (described below).  In July 2001 a rate proceeding commenced by System Energy at the FERC in 1995 became final, with the FERC approving a prospective 10.94% return on equity.    In 1998 the FERC approved requests by Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to accelerate a portion of their Grand Gulf purchased power obligations.  Entergy Arkansas’s and Entergy Mississippi’s acceleration of Grand Gulf purchased power obligations ceased effective July 2001 and July 2003, respectively, as approved by the FERC.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of complaints filed with the FERC regarding System Energy’s return on equity.

Unit Power Sales Agreement

The Unit Power Sales Agreement allocates capacity, energy, and the related costs from System Energy’s ownership and leasehold interests in Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas (36%), Entergy Louisiana (14%), Entergy Mississippi (33%), and Entergy New Orleans (17%).  Each of these companies is obligated to make payments to System Energy for its entitlement of capacity and energy on a full cost-of-service basis regardless of the quantity of energy delivered.  Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy’s only source of operating revenue.  The financial condition of System Energy depends upon the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf and the receipt of such payments.  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans generally recover payments made under the Unit Power Sales Agreement through rates charged to their customers.

In the case of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana, payments are also recovered through sales of electricity from their respective retained shares of Grand Gulf.  Under a settlement agreement entered into with the APSC in 1985 and amended in 1988, Entergy Arkansas retains 22% of its 36% share of Grand Gulf-related costs and recovers the remaining 78% of its share in rates.  In the event that Entergy Arkansas is not able to sell its retained share to third parties, it may sell such energy to its retail customers at a price equal to its avoided cost, which is currently less than Entergy Arkansas’s cost from its retained share.  Entergy Arkansas has life-of-resources purchased power agreements with Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans that sell a portion of the output of Entergy Arkansas’s retained share of Grand Gulf to those companies, with the remainder of the retained share being sold to Entergy Mississippi through a separate life-of-resources purchased power agreement.  In a series of LPSC orders, court decisions, and agreements from late 1985 to mid-1988, Entergy Louisiana was granted rate relief with respect to costs associated with Entergy Louisiana’s share of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf, subject to certain terms and conditions.  Entergy Louisiana retains and does not recover from retail ratepayers 18% of its 14% share of the costs of Grand Gulf capacity and energy and recovers the remaining 82% of its share in rates.  Entergy Louisiana is allowed to recover through the fuel adjustment clause at 4.6 cents per kWh for the energy related to its retained portion of these costs.  Alternatively, Entergy Louisiana may sell such energy to non-affiliated parties at prices above the fuel adjustment clause recovery amount, subject to the LPSC’s approval.  Entergy Arkansas also has a life-of-resources purchased power agreement with Entergy Mississippi to sell a portion of the output of Entergy Arkansas’s non-retained share of Grand Gulf.  Entergy Mississippi was granted rate relief for those purchases by the MPSC through its annual unit power cost rate mechanism.

Availability Agreement

The Availability Agreement among System Energy and Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans was entered into in 1974 in connection with the financing by System Energy of Grand Gulf.  The Availability Agreement provides that System Energy make available to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans all capacity and energy available from System Energy’s share of Grand Gulf.

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans also agreed severally to pay System Energy monthly for the right to receive capacity and energy from Grand Gulf in amounts that (when added to any amounts received by System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement) would at least equal System Energy’s total operating expenses for Grand Gulf (including depreciation at a specified rate and expenses incurred in a permanent shutdown of Grand Gulf) and interest charges.

The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement are fixed as follows: Entergy Arkansas - 17.1%; Entergy Louisiana - 26.9%; Entergy Mississippi - 31.3%; and Entergy New Orleans - 24.7%.  The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement would remain in effect and would govern payments made under such agreement in the event of a shortfall of funds available to System Energy from other sources, including payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.

System Energy has assigned its rights to payments and advances from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under the Availability Agreement as security for its one outstanding series of first mortgage bonds.  In these assignments, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans further agreed that, in the event they were prohibited by governmental action from making payments under the Availability Agreement (for example, if the FERC reduced or disallowed such payments as constituting excessive rates), they would then make subordinated advances to System Energy in the same amounts and at the same times as the prohibited payments.  System Energy would not be allowed to repay these subordinated advances so long as it remained in default under the related indebtedness or in other similar circumstances.

Each of the assignment agreements relating to the Availability Agreement provides that Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans will make payments directly to System Energy. However, if there is an event of default, those payments must be made directly to the holders of indebtedness that are the beneficiaries of such assignment agreements.  The payments must be made pro rata according to the amount of the respective obligations secured.

The obligations of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans to make payments under the Availability Agreement are subject to the receipt and continued effectiveness of all necessary regulatory approvals.  Sales of capacity and energy under the Availability Agreement would require that the Availability Agreement be submitted to the FERC for approval with respect to the terms of such sale.  No such filing with the FERC has been made because sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf are being made pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  If, for any reason, sales of capacity and energy are made in the future pursuant to the Availability Agreement, the jurisdictional portions of the Availability Agreement would be submitted to the FERC for approval.

Since commercial operation of Grand Gulf began, payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to System Energy have exceeded the amounts payable under the Availability Agreement and, therefore, no payments under the Availability Agreement have ever been required.  If Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Mississippi fails to make its Unit Power Sales Agreement payments, and System Energy is unable to obtain funds from other sources, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans could become subject to claims or demands by System Energy or its creditors for payments or advances under the Availability Agreement (or the assignments thereof) equal to the difference between their required Unit Power Sales Agreement payments and their required Availability Agreement payments because their Availability Agreement obligations exceed their Unit Power Sales Agreement obligations.



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

The Availability Agreement may be terminated, amended, or modified by mutual agreement of the parties thereto, without further consent of any assignees or other creditors.

Service Companies

Entergy Services, a limited liability company wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation, provides management, administrative, accounting, legal, engineering, and other services primarily to the Utility operating companies, but also provides services to Entergy Wholesale Commodities.  Entergy Operations is also wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation and provides nuclear management, operations and maintenance services under contract for ANO, River Bend, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, subject to the owner oversight of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, respectively.  Entergy Services and Entergy Operations provide their services to the Utility operating companies and System Energy on an “at cost” basis, pursuant to cost allocation methodologies for these service agreements that were approved by the FERC.

Jurisdictional Separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas

Effective December 31, 2007, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. completed a jurisdictional separation into two vertically integrated utility companies, one operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the PUCT, Entergy Texas, and the other operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the LPSC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  Entergy Texas owns all Entergy Gulf States, Inc. distribution and transmission assets located in Texas, the gas-fired generating plants located in Texas, undivided 42.5% ownership shares of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.’s 70% ownership interest in Nelson Unit 6 and 42% ownership interest in Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, which are coal-fired generating plants located in Louisiana, and other assets and contract rights to the extent related to utility operations in Texas.  Entergy Louisiana, as successor in interest to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, owns all of the remaining assets that were owned by Entergy Gulf States, Inc.  On a book value basis, approximately 58.1% of the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. assets were allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and approximately 41.9% were allocated to Entergy Texas.

Entergy Texas purchases from Entergy Louisiana pursuant to a life-of-unit purchased power agreement a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the 70% of River Bend subject to retail regulation.  Entergy Texas was allocated a share of River Bend’s nuclear and environmental liabilities that is identical to the share of the plant’s output purchased by Entergy Texas under the purchased power agreement.  In connection with the termination of the System Agreement effective August 31, 2016, the purchased power agreements that were put in place for certain legacy units at the time of the jurisdictional separation were also terminated at that time.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the purchased power agreements.

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Business Combination

On October 1, 2015, the businesses formerly conducted by Entergy Louisiana (Old Entergy Louisiana) and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana (Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) were combined into a single public utility.  In order to effect the business combination, under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Old Entergy Louisiana allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy Louisiana Power, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (New Entergy Louisiana), and New Entergy Louisiana assumed the liabilities of Old Entergy Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC.  Under the TXBOC, Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary (New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) and New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana assumed the liabilities of Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC.  New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana then merged into New Entergy Louisiana with New Entergy Louisiana surviving the merger.  Thereupon, Old Entergy Louisiana changed its name from “Entergy Louisiana, LLC” to “EL Investment Company, LLC” and New Entergy Louisiana changed its name from “Entergy Louisiana Power, LLC” to “Entergy Louisiana, LLC” (Entergy Louisiana).  With the completion of the business combination, Entergy Louisiana holds substantially all of the assets, and has assumed the liabilities, of Old Entergy Louisiana and Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.

The primary purpose of NYISO and MISO is to direct the operations of the major generation and transmission facilities in their respective regions; ensure grid reliability; administer and monitor wholesale electricity markets; and plan for their respective region’s energy needs.

Energy and Capacity Sales

As a wholesale generator, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ core business is selling energy, measured in MWh, to its customers.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities enters into forward contracts with its customers and also sells energy in the day ahead or spot markets.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities also sells unforced capacity, which allows load-serving entities to meet specified reserve and related requirements placed on them by the ISOs in their respective areas.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ forward physical power contracts consist of contracts to sell energy only, contracts to sell capacity only, and bundled contracts in which it sells both capacity and energy.  While the terminology and payment mechanics vary in these contracts, each of these types of contracts requires Entergy Wholesale Commodities to deliver MWh of energy, make capacity available, or both.

See “

Market and Credit Risk Sensitive Instruments

” in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for additional information regarding these contracts.

As part of the purchase of the Palisades plant in 2007, Entergy executed a 15-year PPA with the seller, Consumers Energy, for 100% of the plant’s output, excluding any future uprates.  Under the purchased power agreement, Consumers Energy receives the value of any new environmental credits for the first ten years of the agreement.  Palisades and Consumers Energy will share on a 50/50 basis the value of any new environmental credits for years 11 through 15 of the agreement.  The environmental credits are defined as benefits from a change in law that causes capability of the plant as of the purchase date to become a tradable attribute (e.g., emission credit, renewable energy credit, environmental credit, “green” credit, etc.) or otherwise to have a market value.  Entergy intends to shut down the Palisades nuclear power plant permanently on May 31, 2022 and transfer to Holtec thereafter.



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Customers

Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ customers for the sale of both energy and capacity from its nuclear plants include retail power providers, utilities, electric power co-operatives, power trading organizations, and other power generation companies.  These customers include Consumers Energy, the company from which Entergy purchased the Palisades plant, and NYISO and MISO.  Substantially all of the credit exposure associated with the planned energy output under contract for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants is with counterparties or their guarantors that have public investment grade credit ratings.

Competition

The NYISO market is highly competitive.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities has numerous competitors in New York including generation companies affiliated with regulated utilities, other independent power producers, municipal and co-operative generators, owners of co-generation plants and wholesale power marketers.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities is an independent power producer, which means it generates power for sale to third parties at day ahead or spot market prices to the extent that the power is not sold under a fixed price contract.  Municipal and co-operative generators also generate power but use most of it to deliver power to their municipal or co-operative power customers.  Owners of co-generation plants produce power primarily for their own consumption.  Wholesale power marketers do not own generation; rather they buy power from generators or other market participants and resell it to retail providers or other market participants.  Competition in the New York power market is affected by, among other factors, the amount of generation and transmission capacity in these markets.  MISO does not have a centralized clearing capacity market, but load serving entities do meet the majority of their capacity needs through bilateral contracts and self-supply with a smaller portion coming through voluntary MISO auctions.  The majority of Palisades’ current output is contracted to Consumers Energy through 2022.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities does not expect to be materially affected by competition in the MISO market in the near term.

Seasonality

Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ revenues and operating income are subject to fluctuations during the year due to seasonal factors, weather conditions, and contract pricing.  Refueling outages are generally in the spring and fall, and cause volumetric decreases during those seasons.  When outdoor and cooling water temperatures are low, generally during colder months, Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants operate more efficiently, and consequently, generate more electricity.  Many of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ contracts provide for shaped pricing over the course of the year.  As a result of these factors, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ revenues are typically higher in the first and third quarters than in the second and fourth quarters.

Fuel Supply

Nuclear Fuel

See “

Fuel Supply

-

Nuclear Fuel

” in the Utility portion of Part I, Item 1 for a discussion of the nuclear fuel cycle and markets.  Entergy Nuclear Fuels Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary, is responsible for contracts to acquire nuclear materials, except for fuel fabrication, for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, while Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. acts as the agent for the purchase of nuclear fuel assembly fabrication services.  All contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel are between the DOE and each of the nuclear power plant owners.  The nuclear fuel supply portfolio for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment has been adjusted to reflect reduced overall requirements related to the planned permanent shutdowns of the Indian Point 2, Indian Point 3, and Palisades plants.  Fuel procurement for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment is limited to the requirements of the Palisades plant’s final refueling in 2020.

Other Business Activities

Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC (ENPM) was formed in 2005 to centralize the power marketing function for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants.  Upon its formation, ENPM entered into long-term power purchase agreements with the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries that own nuclear power plants (generating subsidiaries).  As part of a series of agreements, ENPM agreed to assume and/or otherwise service the existing power purchase agreements that were in effect between the generating subsidiaries and their customers.  ENPM’s functions include origination of new energy and capacity transactions and generation scheduling.

Entergy Nuclear, Inc. can pursue service agreements with other nuclear power plant owners who seek the advantages of Entergy’s scale and expertise but do not necessarily want to sell their assets.  Services provided by either Entergy Nuclear, Inc. or other Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries include engineering, operations and maintenance, fuel procurement, management and supervision, technical support and training, administrative support, and other managerial or technical services required to operate, maintain, and decommission nuclear electric power facilities.

TLG Services, a subsidiary of Entergy Nuclear, Inc., offers decommissioning, engineering, and related services to nuclear power plant owners.

Entergy provides plant operation support services for the 800 MW Cooper Nuclear Station located near Brownville, Nebraska.  In 2010 an Entergy subsidiary signed an agreement to extend the management support services to Cooper Nuclear Station by 15 years, through January 2029.

Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry

Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and Energy Reorganization Act of 1974

Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, the operation of nuclear plants is heavily regulated by the NRC, which has broad power to impose licensing and safety-related requirements.  The NRC has broad authority to impose civil penalties or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, as owners of all or portions of ANO, River Bend and Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, respectively, and Entergy Operations, as the licensee and operator of these units, are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC.  Entergy subsidiaries in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment are subject to the NRC’s jurisdiction as the owners and operators of Indian Point Energy Center, Palisades, and Big Rock Point.



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982

Spent Nuclear Fuel

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is required, for a specified fee, to construct storage facilities for, and to dispose of, all spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste generated by domestic nuclear power reactors.  Entergy’s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries have been charged fees for the estimated future disposal costs of spent nuclear fuel in accordance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.  The affected Entergy companies entered into contracts with the DOE, whereby the DOE is to furnish disposal services at a cost of one mill per net kWh generated and sold after April 7, 1983, plus a one-time fee for generation prior to that date.  Entergy Arkansas is the only one of the Utility operating companies that generated electric power with nuclear fuel prior to that date and has a recorded liability as of December 31, 2019 of $191.1 million for the one-time fee.  Entergy accepted assignment of the Pilgrim, FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3, Indian Point 1 and Indian Point 2, Vermont Yankee, Palisades, and Big Rock Point spent fuel disposal contracts with the DOE held by their previous owners.  The FitzPatrick spent fuel disposal contract was assigned to Exelon as part of the sale of the plant, completed in March 2017.  The Vermont Yankee spent fuel disposal contract was assigned to NorthStar as part of the sale of the plant which was completed in January 2019.  The Pilgrim spent fuel disposal contract was transferred to Holtec as part of the sale of Entergy Nuclear Generation Company in August 2019.  The owners of these plants previous to Entergy have paid or retained liability for the fees for all generation prior to the purchase dates of those plants.  The fees payable to the DOE may be adjusted in the future to assure full recovery.  Entergy considers all costs incurred for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, except accrued interest, to be proper components of nuclear fuel expense.  Provisions to recover such costs have been or will be made in applications to regulatory authorities for the Utility plants.  Entergy’s total spent fuel fees to date, including the one-time fee liability of Entergy Arkansas, have surpassed $1.6 billion (exclusive of amounts relating to Entergy plants that were paid or are owed by prior owners of those plants).

The permanent spent fuel repository in the U.S. has been legislated to be Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  The DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing (the DOE filed the license application in June 2008) and, after the license is granted by the NRC, proceed with the repository construction and commencement of receipt of spent fuel.  Because the DOE has not begun accepting spent fuel, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts.  The DOE continues to delay meeting its obligation.  Specific steps were taken to discontinue the Yucca Mountain project, including a motion to the NRC to withdraw the license application with prejudice and the establishment of a commission to develop recommendations for alternative spent fuel storage solutions.  In August 2013 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ordered the NRC to continue with the Yucca Mountain license review, but only to the extent of funds previously appropriated by Congress for that purpose and not yet used.  Although the NRC completed the safety evaluation report for the license review in 2015, the previously appropriated funds are not sufficient to complete the review, including required hearings.  The government has taken no effective action to date related to the recommendations of the appointed spent fuel study commission.  Accordingly, large uncertainty remains regarding the time frame under which the DOE will begin to accept spent fuel from Entergy’s facilities for storage or disposal.  As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at Entergy’s nuclear sites.

Following the defunding of the Yucca Mountain spent fuel repository program, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and others sued the government seeking cessation of collection of the one mill per net kWh generated and sold after April 7, 1983 fee.  In November 2013 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the DOE to submit a proposal to Congress to reset the fee to zero until the DOE complies with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act or Congress enacts an alternative waste disposal plan.  In January 2014 the DOE submitted the proposal to Congress under protest, and also filed a petition for rehearing with the D.C. Circuit.  The petition for rehearing was denied.  The zero spent fuel fee went into effect prospectively in May 2014.

As a result of the DOE’s failure to begin disposal of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and the spent fuel disposal contracts, Entergy’s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries have incurred and will continue to incur damages.  These subsidiaries have been, and continue to be, involved in litigation to recover



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

the damages caused by the DOE’s delay in performance.  See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of final judgments recorded by Entergy in 2017, 2018, and 2019 related to Entergy’s nuclear owner licensee subsidiaries’ litigation with the DOE.  Through 2019, Entergy’s subsidiaries won and collected on judgments against the government totaling over $600 million.

Pending DOE acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the owners of nuclear plants are providing their own spent fuel storage.  Storage capability additions using dry casks began operations at Palisades in 1993, at ANO in 1996, at River Bend in 2005, at Grand Gulf in 2006, at Indian Point in 2008, and at Waterford 3 in 2011.  These facilities will be expanded as needed.

Nuclear Plant Decommissioning

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy are entitled to recover from customers through electric rates the estimated decommissioning costs for ANO, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, respectively.  In addition, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas are entitled to recover from customers through electric rates the estimated decommissioning costs for the portion of River Bend subject to retail rate regulation.  The collections are deposited in trust funds that can only be used in accordance with NRC and other applicable regulatory requirements.  Entergy periodically reviews and updates the estimated decommissioning costs to reflect inflation and changes in regulatory requirements and technology, and then makes applications to the regulatory authorities to reflect, in rates, the changes in projected decommissioning costs.

In July 2010 the LPSC approved increased decommissioning collections for Waterford 3 and the Louisiana regulated share of River Bend and in December 2010 the PUCT approved increased decommissioning collections for the Texas share of River Bend to address previously identified funding shortfalls.  This LPSC decision contemplated that the level of decommissioning collections could be revisited should the NRC grant license extensions for both Waterford 3 and River Bend.  In July 2019, following the NRC approval of license extensions for Waterford 3 and River Bend, Entergy made a filing with the LPSC seeking to adjust decommissioning and depreciation rates for those plants, including one proposed scenario that would adjust Louisiana-jurisdictional decommissioning collections to zero for both plants (including an offsetting increase in depreciation rates). An evidentiary hearing on the filing has been scheduled for July 2020, and management cannot predict the outcome of the case.  In December 2018 the APSC ordered collections in rates for decommissioning ANO 2 and found that ANO 1’s decommissioning was adequately funded without additional collections.  In November 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed a revised decommissioning cost recovery tariff for ANO indicating that both ANO 1 and ANO 2 decommissioning trusts were adequately funded without further collections, and in December 2019, the APSC ordered zero collections for ANO 1 and ANO 2 decommissioning.  In December 2018 the PUCT approved a settlement that eliminated River Bend decommissioning collections for the Texas jurisdictional share of the plant based on a determination by Entergy Texas that the existing decommissioning fund was adequate following license renewal.  In September 2016 the NRC issued a 20-year operating license renewal for Grand Gulf.  In a 2017 filing at the FERC, System Energy stated that with the renewed operating license, Grand Gulf’s decommissioning trust was sufficiently funded, and proposed (among other things) to cease decommissioning collections for Grand Gulf effective October 1, 2017.  The FERC accepted a settlement including the proposed decommissioning revenue requirement by letter order in August 2018.  Entergy currently believes its decommissioning funding will be sufficient for its nuclear plants subject to retail rate regulation, although decommissioning cost inflation and trust fund performance will ultimately determine the adequacy of the funding amounts.

In January 2019, Entergy sold 100% of the membership interest in Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee to a subsidiary of NorthStar. As a result of the sale, NorthStar assumed ownership of Vermont Yankee and its decommissioning and site restoration trusts, together with complete responsibility for the facility’s decommissioning and site restoration.  See Note 9 to the financial statements for further discussion of Vermont Yankee decommissioning costs and see “

Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business

” in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of the NorthStar transaction.



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

In August 2019, Entergy sold 100% of the equity interests in Entergy Nuclear Generation Company, LLC to a subsidiary of Holtec International.  As a result of the sale, Holtec assumed ownership of Pilgrim and its decommissioning trust, together with complete responsibility for the facility’s decommissioning and site restoration.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of the sale.

For the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants purchased in 2000 from NYPA, NYPA retained the decommissioning trust funds and the decommissioning liabilities with the right to require the Entergy subsidiaries to assume each of the decommissioning liabilities provided that it assigns the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to the Entergy subsidiaries.  In August 2016, Entergy entered into a trust transfer agreement with NYPA to transfer the decommissioning trust funds and decommissioning liabilities for the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants to Entergy, which was completed in January 2017.  In March 2017, Entergy sold the FitzPatrick plant to Exelon, and as part of the transaction, the FitzPatrick decommissioning trust fund, along with the decommissioning obligation for that plant, was transferred to Exelon. The FitzPatrick spent fuel disposal contract was assigned to Exelon as part of the transaction.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the FitzPatrick sale.

In March 2019 filings with the NRC were made for Entergy subsidiaries’ nuclear plants reporting on decommissioning funding.  Those reports showed that decommissioning funding for each of those nuclear plants met the NRC’s financial assurance and planning requirements.

Additional information with respect to Entergy’s decommissioning costs and decommissioning trust funds is found in Note 9 and Note 16 to the financial statements.

Price-Anderson Act

The Price-Anderson Act requires that reactor licensees purchase and maintain the maximum amount of nuclear liability insurance available and participate in an industry assessment program called Secondary Financial Protection in order to protect the public in the event of a nuclear power plant accident.  The costs of this insurance are borne by the nuclear power industry.  Congress amended and renewed the Price-Anderson Act in 2005 for a term through 2025.  The Price-Anderson Act limits the contingent liability for a single nuclear incident to a maximum assessment of approximately $137.6 million per reactor (with 98 nuclear industry reactors currently participating).  In the case of a nuclear event in which Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, or an Entergy Wholesale Commodities company is liable, protection is afforded through a combination of private insurance and the Secondary Financial Protection program.  In addition to this, insurance for property damage, costs of replacement power, and other risks relating to nuclear generating units is also purchased.  The Price-Anderson Act and insurance applicable to the nuclear programs of Entergy are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to the financial statements.

NRC Reactor Oversight Process

The NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process is a program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response.  The NRC evaluates plant performance by analyzing two distinct inputs: inspection findings resulting from the NRC’s inspection program and performance indicators reported by the licensee.  The evaluations result in the placement of each plant in one of the NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix columns: “licensee response column,” or Column 1, “regulatory response column,” or Column 2, “degraded cornerstone column,” or Column 3, and “multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column,” or Column 4.  Plants in Column 1 are subject to normal NRC inspection activities.  Plants in Column 2, Column 3, or Column 4 are subject to progressively increasing levels of inspection by the NRC with, in general, progressively increasing levels of associated costs.  The nuclear generating plants owned and operated by Entergy’s Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses are currently in Column 1.



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Environmental Regulation

Entergy’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes that Entergy’s businesses are in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted below.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance requirements and costs cannot be precisely estimated.  Except to the extent discussed below, at this time compliance with federal, state, and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise protecting the environment, is incorporated into the routine cost structure of Entergy’s businesses and is not expected to have a material effect on their competitive position, results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.

Clean Air Act and Subsequent Amendments

The Clean Air Act and its amendments establish several programs that currently or in the future may affect Entergy’s fossil-fueled generation facilities and, to a lesser extent, certain operations at nuclear and other  facilities.  Individual states also operate similar independent state programs or delegated federal programs that may include requirements more stringent than federal regulatory requirements.  These programs include:

•

New source review and preconstruction permits for new sources of criteria air pollutants, greenhouse gases, and significant modifications to existing facilities;

•

Acid rain program for control of sulfur dioxide (SO


) and nitrogen oxides (NO

x

);

•

Nonattainment area programs for control of criteria air pollutants, which could include fee assessments for air pollutant emission sources under Section 185 of the Clean Air Act if attainment is not reached in a timely manner;

•

Hazardous air pollutant emissions reduction programs;

•

Interstate Air Transport;

•

Operating permit programs and enforcement of these and other Clean Air Act programs;

•

Regional Haze programs; and

•

New and existing source standards for greenhouse gas and other air emissions.

New Source Review (NSR)

Preconstruction permits are required for new facilities and for existing facilities that undergo a modification that results in a significant net emissions increase and is not classified as routine repair, maintenance, or replacement.  Units that undergo certain non-routine modifications must obtain a permit modification and may be required to install additional air pollution control technologies. In August 2019 the EPA proposed to amend the NSR regulations to clarify when a physical change or change in the method of operation will constitute such a modification.  Entergy has an established process for identifying modifications requiring additional permitting approval and is monitoring the regulations and associated guidance provided by the states and the federal government with regard to the determination of routine repair, maintenance, and replacement.  Several years ago, however, the EPA implemented an enforcement initiative, aimed primarily at coal plants, to identify modifications that it does not consider routine for which the unit did not obtain a modified permit.  Various courts and the EPA have been inconsistent in their judgments regarding modifications that are considered routine and on other legal issues that affect this program.

In February 2011, Entergy received a request from the EPA for several categories of information concerning capital and maintenance projects at the White Bluff and Independence facilities, both located in Arkansas, in order to determine compliance with the Clean Air Act, including NSR requirements and air permits issued by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality.  In August 2011, Entergy’s Nelson facility, located in Louisiana, received a similar request for information from the EPA.  In September 2015 an additional request for similar information was received for the White Bluff facility.  Entergy responded to all requests.  None of these EPA requests for information alleged that the facilities were in violation of law.



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

In January and February 2018, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Power, and other co-owners received 60-day notice of intent to sue letters from the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association concerning allegations of violations of new source review and permitting provisions of the Clean Air Act at the Independence and White Bluff coal-burning units, respectively.  In November 2018, following extensive negotiations, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Power entered a proposed settlement resolving those claims as well as other issues facing Entergy Arkansas’s fossil generation plants.  The settlement, which formally resolves a complaint filed by the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association, is subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arkansas.  In October 2019 the District Court requested supplemental briefing on several issues to be resolved prior to addressing the motion to approve the settlement.  For further information about the settlement, see “Regional Haze” discussed below.

National Ambient Air Quality Standards

The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone, carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide, and requires periodic review of those standards.  When an area fails to meet an ambient standard, it is considered to be in nonattainment and is classified as “marginal,” “moderate,” “serious,” or “severe.”  When an area fails to meet the ambient air standard, the EPA requires state regulatory authorities to prepare state implementation plans meant to cause progress toward bringing the area into attainment with applicable standards.

Ozone Nonattainment

Entergy Texas operates one fossil-fueled generating facility (Lewis Creek) and is in the process of constructing another fossil-fueled generating facility (Montgomery County Power Station) in a geographic area that is not in attainment with the applicable NAAQS for ozone.  The ozone nonattainment area that affects Entergy Texas is the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area.  Both Lewis Creek and the Montgomery County Power Station hold all necessary permits for construction and operation and comply with applicable air quality program regulations.  Measures enacted to return the area to ozone attainment could make these program regulations more stringent.  Entergy will continue to work with state environmental agencies on appropriate methods for assessing attainment and nonattainment with the ozone NAAQS.

Potential SO


Nonattainment

The EPA issued a final rule in June 2010 adopting an SO


1-hour national ambient air quality standard of 75 parts per billion.  In Entergy’s utility service territory, only St. Bernard Parish and Evangeline Parish in Louisiana are designated as nonattainment.  In August 2017 the EPA issued a letter indicating that East Baton Rouge and St. Charles parishes would be designated by December 31, 2020, as monitors were installed to determine compliance.

Entergy continues to monitor this situation.

Hazardous Air Pollutants

The EPA released the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) rule in December 2011, which had a compliance date, with a widely granted one-year extension, of April 2016.  The required controls have been installed and are operational at all affected Entergy units.  In February 2019 the EPA published its proposed rule that finds that it is not “appropriate and necessary” to regulate hazardous air pollutants from electric steam generating units under the provisions of section 112(n) of the Clean Air Act.  This is a reversal of the EPA’s previous finding requiring such regulation.  However, the proposal does not seek to revise the MATS rule at this time.  Entergy will continue to monitor this situation.

Regional Haze

In June 2005 the EPA issued its final Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) regulations that potentially could result in a requirement to install SO


and NO

x

pollution control technology as Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (BART) to continue operating certain of Entergy’s fossil generation units.  The rule leaves certain CAVR determinations to the states.

In Arkansas, the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality prepared a state implementation plan (SIP) for Arkansas facilities to implement its obligations under the CAVR.   In April 2012 the EPA finalized a decision addressing the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP, in which it disapproved a large portion of the Arkansas plan, including the emission limits for NO

x

and SO


at White Bluff.  In April 2015 the EPA published a proposed federal implementation plan (FIP) for Arkansas, taking comment on requiring installation of scrubbers and low NO

x

burners to continue operating both units at the White Bluff plant and both units at the Independence plant and NO

x

controls to continue operating the Lake Catherine plant.  Entergy filed comments by the deadline in August 2015.  Among other comments, including opposition to the EPA’s proposed controls on the Independence units, Entergy proposed to meet more stringent SO


and NO

x

limits at both White Bluff and Independence within three years of the effective date of the final FIP and to cease the use of coal at the White Bluff units at a later date.

In September 2016 the EPA published the final Arkansas Regional Haze FIP.  In most respects, the EPA finalized its original proposal but shortened the time for compliance for installation of the NO

x

controls.  The FIP required an emission limitation consistent with SO


scrubbers at both White Bluff and Independence by October 2021 and NO

x

controls by April 2018.  The EPA declined to adopt Entergy’s proposals related to ceasing coal use as an alternative to SO


scrubbers for White Bluff SO


BART.  In November 2016, Entergy and other interested parties, including the State of Arkansas, filed petitions for administrative reconsideration and stay at the EPA as well as petitions for judicial review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  The Eighth Circuit granted the stay pending settlement discussions and pending the State’s development of a SIP that, if approved by the EPA, would replace the FIP.  The state has proposed its replacement SIP in two parts: Part I considers NO

x

requirements, and Part II considers SO


requirements.  The EPA approved the Part I NO

x

SIP in January 2018.  The Part I SIP requires that Entergy address NO

x

impacts on visibility via compliance with the Cross State Air Pollution Rule ozone-season emission trading program.  Arkansas has finalized a Part II SIP which has been approved by the EPA but is currently pending a state court appeal.  That appeal has been stayed pending the outcome of a federal court case, which may resolve many of the issues on appeal.  The final Part II SIP requires that Entergy achieve SO


emission reductions via the use of low-sulfur coal at both White Bluff and Independence within three years.  The Part II SIP also requires that Entergy cease to use coal at White Bluff by December 31, 2028 and notes the current planning assumption that Entergy’s Independence units will cease to burn coal by December 31, 2030.

In January and February 2018, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Power, and other co-owners received 60-day notice of intent to sue letters from the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association concerning allegations of violations of new source review and permitting provisions of the Clean Air Act at the Independence and White Bluff coal-burning units, respectively.  In November 2018, following extensive negotiations, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Power entered a proposed settlement resolving those claims and reducing the risk that Entergy Arkansas, as operator of Independence and White Bluff, might be compelled under the Clean Air Act’s regional haze program to install costly emissions control technologies.  Consistent with the terms of the settlement and in many cases also the Part II SIP, Entergy Arkansas, along with co-owners, will begin using only low-sulfur coal at Independence and White Bluff by mid-2021; cease to use coal at White Bluff and Independence by the end of 2028 and 2030, respectively; cease operation of the remaining gas unit at Lake Catherine by the end of 2027; reserve the option to develop new generating sources at each plant site; and commit to install or propose to regulators at least 800 MWs of renewable generation by the end of 2027, with at least half installed or proposed by the end of 2022 (which includes two existing Entergy Arkansas projects) and with all qualifying co-owner projects counting toward satisfaction of the obligation.  Under the settlement, the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association also waive certain potential existing claims under federal and state environmental law with respect to specified generating plants. The settlement, which formally resolves a complaint filed by the Sierra Club and the



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

National Parks Conservation Association, is subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.  The EPA, which is allowed to comment on such a settlement agreement, has stated that it has no objections to the settlement.  Pending before the court are a motion by the plaintiffs to approve the settlement, in support of which Entergy made a filing, and motions by the Arkansas Attorney General and the Arkansas Affordable Energy Coalition to intervene and to stay the proceedings.  The Arkansas Attorney General also filed an application before the APSC in December 2018 seeking an investigation into the effects of the settlement.  The Arkansas Affordable Energy Coalition filed to support the application, and Entergy Arkansas filed a motion to dismiss.  The application remains pending before the APSC.  In October 2019 the District Court requested supplemental briefing on several issues to be resolved prior to addressing the motion to approve the settlement.

In Louisiana, Entergy has worked with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) and the EPA to revise the Louisiana SIP for regional haze, which had been disapproved in part in 2012.  The LDEQ submitted a revised SIP in February 2017.  In May 2017 the EPA proposed to approve a majority of the revisions.  In September 2017 the EPA issued a proposed SIP approval for the Nelson plant, requiring an emission limitation consistent with the use of low-sulfur coal, with a compliance date of January 22, 2021.  The EPA issued final approval in December 2017.  The EPA approval was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  In October 2019 the Fifth Circuit affirmed EPA’s SIP approval.

New and Existing Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions

In July 2019 the EPA released the Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE), which applies only to existing coal-fired electric generating units.  The ACE determines that heat rate improvements are the best system of emission reductions and lists six candidate technologies for consideration by states at each coal unit.  The rule and associated rulemakings by the EPA replace the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan rule.  The ACE rule provides states discretion in determining how the best system for emission reductions applies to individual units, including through the consideration of technical feasibility and the remaining useful life of the facility.  Entergy is evaluating the final Affordable Clean Energy Rule’s impacts on its coal units and will monitor litigation challenging the rule.  The EPA also has proposed a revision to the new source performance standard on greenhouse gas emissions that primarily impacts new coal units and, therefore, should not impact Entergy.

Potential Legislative, Regulatory, and Judicial Developments

In addition to the specific instances described above, there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning air emissions, as well as other media, that are under consideration at the federal, state, and local level.  Because of the nature of Entergy’s business, the imposition of any of these initiatives could affect Entergy’s operations.  Entergy continues to monitor these initiatives and activities in order to analyze their potential operational and cost implications.  These initiatives include:

•

designation by the EPA and state environmental agencies of areas that are not in attainment with national ambient air quality standards;

•

introduction of bills in Congress and development of regulations by the EPA proposing further limits on NO

x

, SO


, mercury, and carbon dioxide and other air emissions.  New legislation or regulations applicable to stationary sources could take the form of market-based cap-and-trade programs, direct requirements for the installation of air emission controls onto air emission sources, or other or combined regulatory programs;

•

efforts in Congress or at the EPA to establish a federal carbon dioxide emission tax, control structure or unit performance standards;

•

revisions to the estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon and its use for regulatory impact analysis of Federal laws and regulations;

•

implementation of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative by several states in the northeastern United States and similar actions in other regions of the United States;



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

•

efforts on the state and federal level to codify renewable portfolio standards, clean energy standards, or a similar mechanism requiring utilities to produce or purchase a certain percentage of their power from defined renewable energy sources or energy sources with lower emissions;

•

efforts to develop more stringent state water quality standards, effluent limitations for Entergy’s industry sector, stormwater runoff control regulations, and cooling water intake structure requirements;

•

efforts to restrict the previously-approved continued use of oil-filled equipment containing certain levels of PCBs;

•

efforts by certain external groups to encourage reporting and disclosure of carbon dioxide emissions and risk;

•

the listing of additional species as threatened or endangered, the protection of critical habitat for these species, and developments in the legal protection of eagles and migratory birds; and

•

the regulation of the management, disposal, and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals.

Entergy continues to support national legislation that would increase planning certainty for electric utilities while addressing carbon dioxide emissions in a responsible and flexible manner.  By virtue of its proportionally large investment in low-emitting gas-fired and nuclear generation technologies, Entergy has a low overall carbon dioxide emission “intensity,” or rate of carbon dioxide emitted per megawatt-hour of electricity generated.  In anticipation of the imposition of carbon dioxide emission limits on the electric industry, Entergy initiated actions designed to reduce its exposure to potential new governmental requirements related to carbon dioxide emissions.  These voluntary actions included a formal program to stabilize owned power plant carbon dioxide emissions at 2000 levels through 2005, and Entergy succeeded in reducing emissions below 2000 levels.  In 2006, Entergy started including emissions from controllable power purchases in addition to its ownership share of generation and established a second formal voluntary program to stabilize power plant carbon dioxide emissions and emissions from controllable power purchases, cumulatively over the period, at 20% below 2000 levels through 2010.  In 2011, Entergy extended this commitment through 2020.  Total carbon dioxide emissions representing Entergy’s ownership share of power plants and controllable power purchases in the United States were approximately 40.7 million tons in 2019 and 43.7 tons in 2018.

Entergy voluntarily conducted a climate scenario analysis and published a comprehensive report in March 2019.  The report follows the framework and recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures, describing climate-related governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.  Scenario analysis resulted in Entergy developing and publishing a new goal of reducing the Utility’s emission rate by 50 percent from 2000 levels by 2030.

Entergy participates in the M.J. Bradley & Associates’ Annual Benchmarking Air Emissions Report, an annual analysis of the 100 largest U.S. electric power producers.  The report is available on the M.J. Bradley website.  Entergy’s annual greenhouse gas emissions inventory is also third-party verified, and that certification is made available on the American Carbon Registry website.  Entergy participates annually in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and in 2019 was listed on the North American Index.  Entergy has been listed on the World or North American Index, or both, for eighteen consecutive years.

Clean Water Act

The 1972 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (known as the Clean Water Act) provide the statutory basis for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program, section 402, and the basic structure for regulating the discharge of pollutants from point sources to waters of the United States.  The Clean Water Act requires virtually all discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States to be permitted.  Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act regulates cooling water intake structures, section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires a water quality certification from the state in support of certain federal actions and approvals, and section 404 regulates the dredge and fill of waters of the United States, including jurisdictional wetlands.



Part I Item 1

Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines

The 2015 Steam Electric Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELG) rule requires, among other things, that there be no discharge of bottom ash transport water.  The no-discharge requirement contains no exceptions and could cause compliance problems for Entergy’s coal facilities during heavy storm events and under certain non-routine operational conditions.  The ELG rule’s compliance dates currently are delayed while the EPA reconsiders the rule.   Additionally, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently vacated and remanded the provisions of the rule related to legacy wastewater and leachate.  In November 2019 the EPA released a proposed rule revision on bottom ash transport water that will allow some flexibility for storm events and non-routine operations.  A separate rulemaking is expected to address the legacy wastewater and leachate issues.  Despite the impending rulemaking, Entergy is implementing projects at its White Bluff and Independence plants to convert to zero-discharge systems to comply with the ELG rule and the coal combustion residuals restrictions on impoundments.   Additionally, the Nelson Unit 6 facility is implementing operational and maintenance measures to ensure its original zero-discharge design is maintained for compliance with the ELG rule.

Federal Jurisdiction of Waters of the United States

In February 2019 the EPA published its proposed revised definition of Waters of the United States, which proposes to narrow the scope of Clean Water Act jurisdiction, as compared to a 2015 definition which had been stayed by several federal courts.  The final rule was released in January 2020.  In October 2019 the EPA repealed the 2015 rule and re-codified the pre-existing regulations.  That rule was effective late December 2019.  Numerous challenges are expected for both rules.

Groundwater at Certain Nuclear Sites

The NRC requires nuclear power plants to monitor and report regularly the presence of radioactive material in the environment.  Entergy joined other nuclear utilities and the Nuclear Energy Institute in 2006 to develop a voluntary groundwater monitoring and protection program.  This initiative began after detection of very low levels of radioactive material, primarily tritium, in groundwater at several plants in the United States.  Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen that occurs naturally and is also a byproduct of nuclear plant operations.  In addition to tritium, other radionuclides have been found in site groundwater at nuclear plants.

As part of the groundwater monitoring and protection program, Entergy has: (1) performed reviews of plant groundwater characteristics (hydrology) and historical records of past events on site that may have potentially impacted groundwater; (2) implemented fleet procedures on how to handle events that could impact groundwater; and (3) installed groundwater monitoring wells and began periodic sampling.  The program also includes protocols for notifying local officials if contamination is found.  To date, radionuclides such as tritium have been detected at Arkansas Nuclear One, Indian Point, Palisades, Grand Gulf, and River Bend.  Each of these sites has installed groundwater monitoring wells and implemented a program for testing groundwater at the sites for the presence of tritium and other radionuclides.  Based on current information, the concentrations and locations of radionuclides detected at these plants pose no threat to public health or safety, but each site continues to evaluate the results from its groundwater monitoring program.

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), authorizes the EPA to mandate clean-up by, or to collect reimbursement of clean-up costs from, owners or operators of sites at which hazardous substances may be or have been released.  Certain private parties also may use CERCLA to recover response costs.  Parties that transported hazardous substances to these sites or arranged for the disposal of the substances are also deemed liable by CERCLA.  CERCLA has been interpreted to impose strict, joint and several liability on responsible parties.  Many states have adopted programs similar to CERCLA.  Entergy subsidiaries in the Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses have sent waste materials to various disposal



Part I Item 1

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

sites over the years, and releases have occurred at Entergy facilities including nuclear facilities that have been or will be sold to decommissioning companies.  In addition, environmental laws now regulate certain of Entergy’s operating procedures and maintenance practices that historically were not subject to regulation.  Some disposal sites used by Entergy subsidiaries have been the subject of governmental action under CERCLA or similar state programs, resulting in site clean-up activities.  Entergy subsidiaries have participated to various degrees in accordance with their respective potential liabilities in such site clean-ups and have developed experience with clean-up costs.  The affected Entergy subsidiaries have established provisions for the liabilities for such environmental clean-up and restoration activities.  Details of potentially material CERCLA and similar state program liabilities are discussed in the “

Other Environmental Matters

” section below.

Coal Combustion Residuals

In June 2010 the EPA issued a proposed rule on coal combustion residuals (CCRs) that contained two primary regulatory options: (1) regulating CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or received (including stored) in surface impoundments as so-called “special wastes” under the hazardous waste program of RCRA Subtitle C; or (2) regulating CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or surface impoundments as non-hazardous wastes under Subtitle D of RCRA.  Under both options, CCRs that are beneficially reused in certain processes would remain excluded from hazardous waste regulation.  In April 2015 the EPA published the final CCR rule with the material being regulated under the second scenario presented above - as non-hazardous wastes regulated under RCRA Subtitle D.

The final regulations create new compliance requirements including modified storage, new notification and reporting practices, product disposal considerations, and CCR unit closure criteria.  Entergy believes that on-site disposal options will be available at its facilities, to the extent needed for CCR that cannot be transferred for beneficial reuse.  As of December 31, 2019, Entergy has recorded asset retirement obligations related to CCR management of $19.2 million.

In December 2016 the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act) was signed into law, which authorizes states to regulate coal ash rather than leaving primary enforcement to citizen suit actions.  States may submit to the EPA proposals for a permit program.  In September 2017 the EPA agreed to reconsider certain provisions of the CCR rule in light of the WIIN Act.  In July 2018 the EPA released its initial revisions extending certain deadlines and incorporating some risk-based standards.  In August 2018 the D.C. Circuit vacated several provisions of the CCR rule on the basis that they were inconsistent with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and remanded the matter to the EPA to conduct further rulemaking.  In August 2019 the EPA released its second set of proposed revisions to the CCR rule and plans at least three additional rulemakings.

Pursuant to the EPA Rule, Entergy operates groundwater monitoring systems surrounding its coal combustion residual landfills located at White Bluff, Independence, and Nelson.  Monitoring to date has detected concentrations of certain listed constituents in the area, but has not indicated that these constituents originated at the active landfill cells.  Reporting has occurred as required, and detection monitoring will continue as the rule requires.  In late-2017, Entergy determined that certain in-ground wastewater treatment system recycle ponds at its White Bluff and Independence facilities require management under the new EPA regulations.  In order to meet these regulations, one of two recycle ponds at White Bluff commenced closure in October 2018.  Additionally, the second recycle pond at White Bluff plans to initiate closure on or before October 31, 2020.  Any potential requirements for corrective action or operational changes under the new EPA rule continue to be assessed.  Notably, ongoing litigation has resulted in the EPA’s continuing review of the rule.  Consequently, the nature and cost of additional corrective action requirements may depend, in part, on the outcome of the EPA’s review.

Other Environmental Matters

Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas

Entergy Louisiana, as successor in interest to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, currently is involved in the second phase of the remedial investigation of the Lake Charles Service Center site, located in Lake Charles, Louisiana.  A manufactured gas plant (MGP) is believed to have operated at this site from approximately 1916 to 1931.  Coal tar, a by-product of the distillation process employed at MGPs, apparently was routed to a portion of the property for disposal.  The same area also has been used as a landfill.  In 1999, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. signed a second administrative consent order with the EPA to perform a removal action at the site.  Removal actions addressed contaminated source material, soil, and sediment and included capping certain soil on and off-site.  In 2002 approximately 7,400 tons of contaminated soil and debris were excavated and disposed of from an area within the service center.  In 2003 a cap was constructed over the remedial area to prevent the migration of contamination to the surface.  In August 2005 an administrative order was issued by the EPA requiring that a 10-year groundwater study be conducted at this site.  The groundwater monitoring study commenced in January 2006.  The EPA released the second Five Year Review in 2015.  In that review, the EPA indicated that the remediation technique was insufficient and that Entergy would need to utilize other remediation technologies on the site.  In July 2015, Entergy submitted a Focused Feasibility Study to the EPA outlining the potential remedies and suggesting installation of the new remedial method, a waterloo barrier.  The estimated cost for this remedy is approximately $2 million, to be allocated between Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas.  In early 2017 the EPA indicated that the waterloo barrier may not be necessary and requested revisions to the Focused Feasibility Study.  The EPA released the third Five Year Review in late-2019 confirming that a new remedial method is not necessary but requiring continuation of the current groundwater monitoring.  The site’s remedy includes monitored natural attenuation of groundwater, and institutional controls to restrict groundwater and land use.  The EPA has determined that no additional actions are needed for the remedy to be protective over the long-term, and the remedy is protective of human health and the environment.

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) notified Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas that the TCEQ believes those entities are potentially responsible parties (PRPs) concerning contamination existing at the San Angelo Electric Service Company (SESCO) facility in San Angelo, Texas.  The facility operated as a transformer repair and scrapping facility from the 1930s until 2003.  Both soil and groundwater contamination existed at the site.  Entergy subsidiaries sent transformers to this facility.  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Texas responded to an information request from the TCEQ.  Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas joined a group of PRPs responding to site conditions in cooperation with the State of Texas, creating cost allocation models based on review of SESCO documents and employee interviews, and investigating contribution actions against other PRPs.  Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas have agreed to contribute to the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at the site in a measure proportionate to those companies’ involvement at the site.  Current estimates, although variable depending on ultimate remediation design and performance, indicate that Entergy’s total share of remediation costs likely will be approximately $1.5 million to $2 million.  Groundwater monitoring wells at the site were plugged and abandoned in December 2019 following receipt of a certificate of completion issued by the TCEQ.  Site decommissioning activities will occur, and final disposition of the property will be determined at a later time.

Entergy Texas

In December 2016 a transformer inside the Hartburg, Texas Substation had an internal fault resulting in a release of approximately 15,000 gallons of non-PCB mineral oil.  Cleanup ensued immediately; however, rain caused much of the oil to spread across the substation yard and into a nearby wetland.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and the National Response Center were immediately notified, and the TCEQ responded to the site approximately two hours after the cleanup was initiated.  The remediation liability is estimated at $2.2 million; however, this number could fluctuate depending on the remediation extent and wetland mitigation requirements.  In July 2017, Entergy entered into the Voluntary Cleanup Program with the TCEQ.  In November 2017, additional soil sampling was completed in the wetland area and, in February 2018, a site summary report of findings was submitted to the TCEQ.  The TCEQ responded in June 2018 and requested an ecological exclusion criteria checklist/Tier II screening-level ecological risk assessment, and additional site assessment, additional soil samples, groundwater samples, and some additional diagrams and maps.   In October 2018, Entergy submitted the requested information to the TCEQ.  In January 2019 the TCEQ responded with another request for information.  In March 2019, Entergy submitted the requested information to the TCEQ.  In August 2019 the TCEQ responded with a request for additional information including an Affected Property Assessment Report (APAR) and water well survey.  The TCEQ has agreed that the necessity of the water well survey is dependent on the results of the groundwater resampling that will occur.  Groundwater sampling was completed in December 2019 and results were submitted to the TCEQ for review.  Based on the groundwater sampling results, the TCEQ has indicated that a water well survey is not necessary.  The deadline for submittal of the APAR will be 180 days following the receipt of the TCEQ’s letter confirming approval of the groundwater sampling results.

Litigation

Entergy uses legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against it, but certain states in which Entergy operates have proven to be unusually litigious environments.  Judges and juries in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases.  The litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk to Entergy.

RISK FACTORS

Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Form 10-K.  The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section.  There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy’s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.  See “

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

.”

Utility Regulatory Risks

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that can be lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results.

The Utility operating companies are regulated on a cost-of-service and rate of return basis and are subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures.  The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service.  These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy.  These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment, including adjustment upon the initiative of a regulator or affected stakeholders.

In addition, regulators may initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies’ base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies’ operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates.  The regulators may disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs.  Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates.  Traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. The length of these base rate proceedings can cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates, such that the Utility operating companies may not fully recover all costs during the rate effective period and the Utility operating companies may, therefore, earn less than their allowed returns.  Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings.

The Utility operating companies have large customer and stakeholder bases and, as a result, could be the subject of public criticism or adverse publicity focused on issues including the operation of their assets and infrastructure or the quality of their service.  Criticism or adverse publicity of this nature could render legislatures and other governing bodies, public service commissions and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view the applicable operating company in a favorable light and could potentially negatively affect legislative or regulatory processes or outcomes, as well as lead to increased regulatory oversight or more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements.

The base rates of Entergy Texas are established largely in traditional base rate case proceedings.  Between base rate proceedings, Entergy Texas has available rate riders to recover the revenue requirements associated with certain incremental costs.  For example, Entergy Texas has recovered distribution-related capital investments through the distribution cost recovery factor rider mechanism, transmission-related capital investments and certain non-fuel MISO charges through the transmission cost recovery factor rider mechanism, and MISO fuel and energy-related costs



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

through the fixed fuel factor mechanism.  Entergy Texas is also required to make a filing every three years, at a minimum, reconciling its fuel and purchased power costs and fuel factor revenues.  In the course of this reconciliation, the PUCT determines whether eligible fuel and fuel-related expenses and revenues are necessary and reasonable, and makes a prudence finding for each of the fuel-related contracts for the reconciliation period.

Between base rate cases, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi are able to adjust base rates annually through formula rate plans that utilize a forward test year (Entergy Arkansas) or forward-looking features (Entergy Mississippi).  In response to Entergy Arkansas’s application for a general change in rates in 2015, the APSC approved the formula rate plan tariff proposed by Entergy Arkansas including its use of a projected year test period and an initial five-year term.  The initial five-year term expires in 2021 unless Entergy Arkansas requests, and the APSC approves, the extension of the formula rate plan tariff for an additional five years through 2026.  If Entergy Arkansas’s formula rate plan were terminated or not extended beyond the initial term, Entergy Arkansas could file an application for a general change in rates that may include a request for continued regulation under a formula rate review mechanism.  If Entergy Mississippi’s formula rate plan is terminated, it would revert to the more traditional rate case environment or seek approval of a new formula rate plan.  Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi recover fuel and purchased energy and certain non-fuel costs through other APSC-approved and MPSC-approved tariffs, respectively.

Entergy Louisiana historically sets electric base rates annually through a formula rate plan using an historic test year.  The form of the formula rate plan, on a combined basis, was approved in connection with the business combination of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and largely followed the formula rate plans that were approved by the LPSC in connection with the full electric base rate cases filed by those companies in February 2013.  The formula rate plan was most recently extended through the test year 2019; certain modifications were made in that extension, including a decrease to the allowed return on equity and the addition of a transmission cost recovery mechanism.  The formula rate plan continues to include exceptions from the rate cap and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment projects, including acquisition or construction of generating facilities and purchase power agreements approved by the LPSC and as noted, for certain transmission investment, among other items.  MISO fuel and energy-related costs are recoverable in Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause.  In the event that the electric formula rate plan is not renewed or extended, Entergy Louisiana would revert to the more traditional rate case environment.

Entergy New Orleans previously operated under a formula rate plan that ended with the 2011 test year.  Based on a settlement agreement approved by the City Council, with limited exceptions, the base rates of Entergy New Orleans were frozen until rates were implemented in connection with the base rate case filed by Entergy New Orleans in 2018.  In November 2019 the City Council issued a resolution resolving the rate case, with rates to become effective retroactive to August 2019.  The resolution allows Entergy New Orleans to implement a three-year formula rate plan, beginning with the 2019 test year as adjusted for forward-looking known and measurable changes.  Entergy New Orleans has appealed the resolution.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion.

The rates of System Energy are established by the FERC, and the costs allowed to be charged pursuant to these rates are, in turn, passed through to the participating Utility operating companies through the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which allows monthly adjustments to reflect the current operating costs of, and investment in, Grand Gulf.  The Unit Power Sales Agreement is currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC, including a challenge with respect to System Energy’s authorized return on equity and capital structure and a request in a separate proceeding for FERC to initiate a broader investigation of rates under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the proceedings.  The Utility operating companies have agreed to implement certain protocols for providing retail regulators with information regarding rates billed under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.

The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms.  For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

Changes to state or federal legislation or regulation affecting electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and related activities could adversely affect Entergy and the Utility operating companies’ financial position, results of operations or cash flows and their utility businesses.

If legislative and regulatory structures evolve in a manner that erodes the Utility operating companies’ exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers, they could lose customers and sales and their results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be materially affected.  Additionally, technological advances in energy efficiency and distributed energy resources are reducing the costs of these technologies and together with ongoing state and federal subsidies, the increasing penetration of these technologies could result in reduced sales by the Utility operating companies.  Such loss of sales could put upward pressure on rates, resulting in adverse regulatory actions to mitigate such effects on rates.  Entergy and the Utility operating companies cannot predict if or when they may be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, or the extent and timing of reductions of the cost of distributed energy resources, nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The Utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings.

The Utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment.  Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred, including the cost of replacement power purchased when generators experience outages, with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs.  Regulators may also initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, there can be no assurance that existing recovery mechanisms will remain unchanged or in effect at all.

The Utility operating companies’ cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates.  On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period’s fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies.  For a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

There remains uncertainty regarding the effect of the termination of the System Agreement on the Utility operating companies.

The Utility operating companies historically engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that had been approved by the FERC.  The System Agreement terminated in its entirety on August 31, 2016.

There remains uncertainty regarding the long-term effect of the termination of the System Agreement on the Utility operating companies because of the significant effect of the agreement on the generation and transmission functions of the Utility operating companies and the significant period of time (over 30 years) that it had been in existence.  In the absence of the System Agreement, there remains uncertainty around the effectiveness of governance processes and the potential absence of federal authority to resolve certain issues among the Utility operating companies and their retail regulators.

In addition, although the System Agreement terminated in its entirety in August 2016, there are a number of outstanding System Agreement proceedings at the FERC that may require future adjustments, including challenges to



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

the level and timing of payments made by Entergy Arkansas under the System Agreement.  The outcome and timing of these FERC proceedings and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time.

For further information regarding the regulatory proceedings relating to the System Agreement, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. The operation of the Utility operating companies’ transmission system pursuant to the MISO RTO tariff and their participation in the MISO RTO’s wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.

On December 19, 2013, the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO.  MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies.  The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market rules.  The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets. MISO tariff rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the Utility operating companies’ ability to sell power in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, and MISO market rules may change in ways that cause additional risk.

The Utility operating companies participate in the MISO regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that MISO makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the Utility operating companies’ transmission assets that are under MISO’s functional control. The Utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect the cost of transmission projects that the Utility operating companies do not own, which could increase cash or financing needs.  MISO has made filings with FERC proposing changes in the transmission project criteria in MISO.  These changes, if adopted, could potentially result in a larger volume of competitively bid and regionally cost allocated transmission projects.  In addition to the cash and financing-related risks arising from the potential additional cost allocation to the Utility operating companies from these projects, there is a risk that the Utility operating companies’ business and financial position could be harmed as a result of lost investment opportunities and other effects that flow from an increased number of competitive projects being approved and constructed that are interconnected with their transmission systems.  Further, the terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets, the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, the MISO-wide allowed base rate of return on equity, and any required MISO-related charges and credits are subject to regulation by the FERC. The operation of the Utility operating companies’ transmission system pursuant to the MISO tariff and their participation in the MISO wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.  In addition, orders from each of the Utility operating companies’ respective retail regulators generally require that the Utility operating companies make periodic filings, or generally allow the retail regulator to direct the making of such filings, setting forth the results of analysis of the costs and benefits realized from MISO membership as well as the projected costs and benefits of continued membership in MISO and/or requesting approval of their continued membership in MISO.  These filings have been submitted periodically by each of the Utility operating companies as required by their respective retail regulators, and the outcome of the resulting proceedings may affect the Utility operating companies’ continued membership in MISO.

A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather.

Entergy’s and its Utility operating companies’ results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather.  Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages.  A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather.

Nuclear Operating, Shutdown and Regulatory Risks

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy)

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect Entergy’s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.  Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs.  Consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors, consistent with safety requirements.  For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their owned or contractually controlled facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs.  For the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ forward sales are comprised of various hedge products, many of which have some degree of operational-contingent price risk.  Certain unit-contingent contracts guarantee specified minimum capacity factors.  In the event plants with these contracts were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, Entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power.  Further, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm LD basis, which subjects Entergy to increasing price risk as capacity factors decrease. Many of these firm hedge products have damages risk.

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel.  Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages.  If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy’s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected.

Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be “turned off.”  Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months.  Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages, which typically extends the planned outage duration.  When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease, and maintenance costs may increase.  Lower than forecasted capacity factors may cause Entergy Wholesale Commodities to experience reduced revenues and may also create damages risk with certain hedge products as previously discussed.



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication).  These risks could materially affect Entergy’s and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy’s nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through 2020 and beyond.  The nuclear fuel supply portfolio for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment has been adjusted to reflect reduced overall requirements related to the planned permanent shutdown and sale of the Palisades, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 plants over the next three years and fuel procurement is limited to the final refueling of the Palisades plant in 2020

.

Entergy’s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners.  While there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time.  Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S.  Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past and may be subject to increased volatility due to the imposition of tariffs, domestic purchase requirements or shifting trade arrangements between countries.  Although Entergy’s nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price changes could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.

Entergy’s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers.  These service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers.  For conversion and enrichment services, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel.  For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant’s nuclear fuel; therefore, Entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel.  Certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon countries, such as Russia, in which international sanctions or tariffs could restrict the ability of such suppliers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services at acceptable prices or at all.  The inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations, suspend or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their nuclear plants, which could materially affect Entergy’s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants.  The NRC may modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities.  Interested parties may also intervene which could result in prolonged proceedings.  A change in the Atomic Energy Act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses, or the NRC’s interpretation thereof, may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of Entergy (through Entergy Wholesale Commodities), its Utility operating companies, or System Energy.  A change in the classification of a plant owned by one of these companies under the NRC’s Reactor Oversight Process, which is the NRC’s program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response, also could cause the owner of the plant to incur material additional costs as a result of the increased oversight activity and potential response costs associated with the change in classification.

For additional information concerning the current classification of the plants owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and

the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see “

Regulation of Entergy’s Business

-

Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry

-

NRC Reactor Oversight Process

” in Part I, Item 1 and Note 8 to the financial statements.

Events at nuclear plants owned by one of these companies, as well as those owned by others, may lead to a change in laws or regulations or the terms of the applicable licenses, or the NRC’s interpretation thereof, or may cause the NRC to increase oversight activity or initiate actions to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility, or impose civil penalties.  As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities.

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect Entergy’s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy,

and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s.  Older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating safely and efficiently.  This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement.  Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in increased costs, some of which costs may not be fully recoverable by the Utility operating companies and System Energy in regulatory proceedings should there be a determination of imprudence.  Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy’s subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity.  If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense.  A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity.  For the Utility operating companies and System Energy, this could result in certain costs being stranded and potentially not fully recoverable in regulatory proceedings.  For Entergy Wholesale Commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers.  In addition, the operation and maintenance of Entergy’s nuclear facilities require the commitment of substantial human resources that can result in increased costs.

The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to the effects of stress corrosion cracking and other corrosion mechanisms on certain materials within plant systems.  The issue is applicable at all nuclear units to varying degrees and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies.  Developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance.

Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy’s nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished, and in some cases, parts are no longer available and have to be reverse-engineered for replacement.  In addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed.  This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy.

The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements.

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants incur costs for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel.  The approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, or



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel.  For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the NRC licensing of the Yucca Mountain repository is effectively at a standstill.  These actions are prolonging the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy’s plant sites.  Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the DOE for such breach.  Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE will commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal.  As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies’ nuclear sites and maintenance costs on existing storage facilities, including aging management of fuel storage casks, may increase.  The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage.  In addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning.  For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the “

” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 8 to the financial statements.

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on Entergy’s and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere.  The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner’s public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool, which is referred to as Secondary Financial Protection, up to approximately $137.6 million per reactor.   With 98 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $14 billion per incident.  The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors.  As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers, which is $450 million for each operating site.  Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under Secondary Financial Protection.  As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy’s Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary insurance level, up to a maximum of approximately $137.6 million per reactor per incident (Entergy’s maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.101 billion).  The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to approximately $21 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $137.6 million cap.

NEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members, including the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants.  All member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the NEIL surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to

insured losses.  As of December 31, 2019, the maximum annual assessment amounts total $112 million for the Utility plants.  Retrospective premium insurance available through NEIL’s reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants currently maintain the retrospective premium insurance to cover those potential assessments.

As an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event.  Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition,



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries.

The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if market performance and other changes decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, if one or more of Entergy’s nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, if the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require significant additional funding.

Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants.  Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose.  Certain of the Utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies.  Those rate collections, as adjusted from time to time by rate regulators, are generally based upon operating license lives and trust fund balances as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs.  Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds.

Under NRC regulations, nuclear plant owners are permitted to project the NRC-required decommissioning amount, based on an NRC formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount that will be available in each nuclear power plant’s decommissioning trusts combined with any other decommissioning financial assurances in place.  The projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-specific estimate is used.  If the projected amount of each individual plant’s decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations.  If the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs required to decommission these nuclear power plants, or funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula, formula inputs, or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources or commitments would be required.  Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the NRC may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the NRC’s formula.  The NRC may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs.  In addition to NRC requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy.

Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants or may restrict the decommissioning-related costs that can be paid from the decommissioning trusts.  Such changes also could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms.  As a result, under any of these circumstances, Entergy’s results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected.

An early plant shutdown (either generally or relative to current expectations), poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs (including as a result of changing regulatory requirements) could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the Utility operating companies, System Energy or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide significant additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning, which, with respect to the Utility operating companies, may not be recoverable from customers in a timely fashion or at all.

New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation and decommissioning of Entergy’s nuclear power plants.

New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel.  These concerns have led to, and may continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy’s subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that might lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, additional requirements or restrictions related to spent nuclear fuel on-site storage and eventual disposal, or other adverse effects on owning, operating and decommissioning nuclear generating units.  Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals.  If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on Entergy’s results of operations and financial condition.

(Entergy Corporation)

Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk.

Entergy and its subsidiaries do not have a regulator-authorized rate of return on their capital investments in non-utility businesses.  As a result, the sale of capacity and energy from the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. In order to reduce future price risk to desired levels, Entergy Wholesale Commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and Firm LD and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars.  As of December 31, 2019, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 97% in 2020, 92% in 2021, and 66% in 2022 of its generation portfolio’s planned energy output, reflecting the planned shutdown and sale of the remaining Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants by mid-2022.

Market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity, and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix.  The obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages.  For some unit-contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold.  Firm LD sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk, a portion of which may be capped through the use of risk management products, to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices.

Market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases.  Demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply.  During periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed.  Also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets.

The effects of sustained low natural gas prices and power market structure challenges have resulted in lower market prices for electricity in the power regions where the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are located.  In addition, currently the market design under which the plants operate does not adequately compensate merchant nuclear plants for their environmental and fuel diversity benefits in the region.  These conditions were  primary



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

factors leading to Entergy’s decision to shut down (or sell) Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants before the end of their operating licenses (or requested operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3).

The price that different counterparties offer for various products including forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements, and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period.  Depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.  New hedges are generally layered into on a rolling forward basis, which tends to drive hedge over-performance to market in a falling price environment, and hedge underperformance to market in a rising price environment; however, hedge timing, product choice, and hedging costs will also affect these results. See the “

Market and Credit Risk Sensitive Instruments

” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries.  Since Entergy Wholesale Commodities has announced the closure (or sale) of its nuclear plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may enter into fewer forward sales contracts for output from such plants.

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and local laws.  Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability.

Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity.  Each of the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants that generates electricity, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC, is a “public utility” under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities.  The FERC has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates.  The FERC’s orders that grant the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions.  In addition, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation.  If the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the FERC’s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules.  This could have an adverse effect on the rates the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business charges for power from its facilities.

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operators.  The Independent System Operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets may impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets.  These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business’ generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets.  For further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the “

Regulation of Entergy’s Business

” section in Part I, Item 1.



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry is subject to changes as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels.  Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business.  In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism, have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, and have made proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share.  Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models.  If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business’ results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected.

The power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on Entergy’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Entergy reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain.  Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operations of such assets.  Projected net cash flows depend on the expected operating life of the assets, the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining life of the assets.  In particular, the remaining assets of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to further impairment in connection with the closure and sale of its nuclear power plants.  Moreover, prior to the closure and sale of these plants, the failure of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows, a reduction in the expected remaining useful life of a unit, or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential additional impairment charges for the affected assets.

If Entergy concludes that any of its nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate through its planned shutdown date, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in a further impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant.  Any impairment charge taken by Entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the remaining power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on Entergy’s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.  For further information regarding evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, see the “

General Business

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices.  Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital.

Entergy’s business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

other terms.  At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.  In addition, Entergy’s and the Utility operating companies’ liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy’s service territory with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008, and Hurricane Isaac in 2012.  The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, changes in regulation or governmental policy (including tax and trade policy), or other unknown events, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase.  In addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage.  Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy and the Utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets.

The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of high interest rates, and uncertainty or reduced liquidity in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries’ ability to maintain and to expand their businesses.  Access to capital markets could be restricted and/or borrowing costs could be increased due to certain sources of debt and equity capital being unwilling to invest in companies that experience extreme weather events, that rely on fossil fuels or offerings to fund fossil fuel projects, or due to risks related to climate change.  Events beyond Entergy’s control may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities.  Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal.  Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities.  If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit Entergy Corporation’s ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level.

ability to access capital and/or could require Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness.

There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including each Registrant’s regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity.  If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy Corporation’s, any of the Utility operating companies’, or System Energy’s ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements.

Most of Entergy Corporation’s and its subsidiaries’ suppliers and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions.  If Entergy Corporation’s or its subsidiaries’ ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2019, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had liquidity exposure of $78 million under the guarantees in place supporting Entergy Wholesale Commodities transactions and $19 million of posted cash collateral.  In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation’s credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

of December 31, 2019, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $30 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements.  As of December 31, 2019, the liquidity exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale Commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously posted collateral from counterparties, would increase by $90 million for a $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets.

Recent U.S. tax legislation may materially adversely affect Entergy’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 significantly changed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including taxation of U.S. corporations, by, among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures.  The legislation and interpretive guidance from the IRS are unclear in certain respects and will require further interpretations and implementing regulations by the IRS, as well as state tax authorities, and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation.

As further described in Note 3 to the financial statements, as a result of amortization of accumulated deferred income taxes and payment of such amounts to customers in 2019, Entergy’s net regulatory liability for income taxes balance is $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2019.  Depending on the outcome of IRS examinations or tax positions and elections that Entergy may make, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries may be required to record additional charges or credits to income tax expense.  Further, there may be other material effects resulting from the legislation that have not been identified.

For further information regarding the effects of the Act, see the “

Income Tax Legislation

” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy.  Also, Note 3 to the financial statements contains additional discussion of the effect of the Act on 2017, 2018 and 2019 results of operations and financial position, the provisions of the Act, and the uncertainties associated with accounting for the Act, and Note 2 to the financial statements discusses the regulatory proceedings that have considered the effects of the Act.

Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy’s, the Utility operating companies’, and System Energy’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities.  These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes.  These judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken.  Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements.  Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy’s, the Utility operating companies’, and System Energy’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  For further information regarding Entergy’s income taxes, see Note 3 to the financial statements.

Entergy and its subsidiaries’ ability to successfully execute on their business strategies, including their ability to complete strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, and, as a result, they may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated results of such strategies, which could materially affect their future prospects, results of operations and benefits that they anticipate from such transactions.

Entergy and its subsidiaries’ future prospects and results of operations significantly depend on their ability to successfully implement their business strategies, which are subject to business, regulatory, economic and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond their control.  As a result, Entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to fully achieve the anticipated results of such strategies.



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Additionally, Entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions.  For example, Entergy has entered into an agreement to sell its equity interests in the subsidiary that owns the Palisades Nuclear Plant and the decommissioned Big Rock Point Nuclear Power Plant and an agreement to sell the equity interests of Indian Point 1, Indian Point 2, and Indian Point 3, in each case after each of the plants has been shut down and defueled.  Also, a significant portion of Entergy’s utility business over the next several years includes the construction and /or purchase of a variety of generating units.  These transactions and plans are or may become subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies.  The failure to complete these transactions or plans or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on Entergy’s or its subsidiaries’ financial condition or results of operations and the market’s perception of Entergy’s ability to execute its strategy.  Further, these transactions, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following:

•

acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;

•

acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;

•

Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to them, that exceed their estimates, or for which their rights to indemnification from the seller are limited;

•

Entergy may experience issues integrating businesses into its internal controls over financial reporting;

•

the disposition of a business, including Entergy’s planned exit from the merchant power business, could divert management’s attention from other business concerns;

•

Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory or governmental approvals to close a transaction, such approvals may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable to them, or Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction or acquired business or assets; and

•

Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that they anticipate from the transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all.

Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that they may encounter in acquiring or divesting a business, or engaging in other strategic transactions, which could have a material effect on their business, financial condition or results of operations.

The completion of capital projects, including the construction of power generation facilities, and other capital improvements involve substantial risks.  Should such efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially affected.

Entergy’s and the Utility operating companies’ ability to complete capital projects, including the construction of power generation facilities, or make other capital improvements, in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks.  These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise, escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance, and reliance on suppliers for timely and satisfactory performance.  Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, levels of public support or opposition, suppliers and contractors not performing as expected or required under their contracts and/or experiencing financial problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations under contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs,  downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects.  If these projects or other capital improvements are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project.  In addition, the Utility operating companies could be exposed to higher costs and market volatility, which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should their respective regulators decline to approve the construction of the project or new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost.

For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with capital projects, including the potential construction and/or purchase of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies’ service territory, and as to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the “

Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital

” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries.

Failure to attract, retain and manage an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively affect Entergy or its subsidiaries’ results of operations.

We rely on a large and changing workforce of team members, including employees, contractors and temporary staffing.  Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatching of skill sets, failing to appropriately anticipate future workforce needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may increase.  Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to operate a modernized, technology-enabled power grid. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to successfully attract, retain and manage an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected.

The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters.

The businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities.  These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures.  These laws and regulations also affect how the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, certain migratory birds and eagles, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters.  Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies.  Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures.  Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties’ claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards.  In addition, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business potentially are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate.  The Utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future.  The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance.

Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated air emissions from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses.  In addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, or are revised or withdrawn by the EPA, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes.  Risks relating to



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

global climate change, initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water availability issues are discussed below.

Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs.  For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the “

Regulation of Entergy

’

s Business

– Environmental Regulation

” section of Part I, Item 1.

The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards.

Entergy’s business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards.  Such standards, which are established by the NERC, the SERC, and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the FERC and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented.  Failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards.  The standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies.  In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the Utility operating companies’ transmission system and generation assets.  In addition, the retail regulators of the Utility operating companies possess the jurisdiction, and in some cases have exercised such jurisdiction, to impose standards governing the reliable operation of the Utility operating companies’ distribution systems, including penalties if these standards are not met.  The changes to the reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses.

Weather, economic conditions, technological developments, and other factors may have a material impact on electricity and gas usage and otherwise materially affect the Utility operating companies

results of operations.

Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase electric cooling demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase electric and gas heating demand and revenues.  As a corollary, mild temperatures in either season tend to decrease energy usage and resulting revenues.  Higher consumption levels coupled with seasonal pricing differentials typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters.  Extreme weather conditions including hurricanes or tropical storms, flooding events, or ice storms may stress the Utility operating companies’ generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and reduced customer satisfaction.  These extreme conditions could have a material effect on the Utility operating companies’ financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

Entergy’s electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors including weather and economic conditions, trends in energy efficiency, new technologies and self-generation alternatives, including the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their grid demand.  Some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting effect on Entergy’s operating results.  Others, such as the organic turnover of appliances and their replacement with more efficient ones, adoption of newer technologies including smart thermostats, new building codes, distributed energy resources, energy storage, demand side management, and rooftop solar are having a more permanent effect by reducing sales growth rates from historical norms.  As a result of these emerging efficiencies and technologies, the Utility operating companies may lose customers or experience lower average use per customer in the residential and commercial classes, and continuing advances have the potential to further limit sales growth in the future.  The



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Utility operating companies also may face competition from other companies offering products and services to Entergy’s customers.  Electricity sales to industrial customers, in particular, benefit from steady economic growth and favorable commodity markets; however, industrial sales are sensitive to changes in conditions in the markets in which its customers operate.  Negative changes in any of these or other factors, particularly sustained economic downturns or sluggishness, have the potential to result in slower sales growth or sales declines and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect Entergy’s and the Utility operating companies’ results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

The effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or increase clean or renewable energy requirements or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business.

In an effort to address climate change concerns, some federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change.  For example, in response to the United States Supreme Court’s 2007 decision holding that the EPA has authority to regulate emissions of CO


and other “greenhouse gases” under the Clean Air Act, the EPA, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations focused considerable attention on CO


emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change.  In 2010, the EPA promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units.  During 2012 and 2014, the EPA proposed CO


emission standards for new and existing sources.  The EPA finalized these standards in 2015; however, in June 2019, the EPA repealed and replaced certain aspects of those regulations.  As examples of state action, in the Northeast, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative establishes a cap on CO


emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their CO


emissions, and a similar program has been developed in California.  The impact that continued changes in the governmental response to climate change risk will have on existing and pending environmental laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions is currently unclear.

Developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction or clean/renewable energy requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects.  The operations of low or non-emitting generating units (such as nuclear units) at lower than expected capacity factors could require increased generation from higher emitting units, thus increasing the company’s greenhouse gas emission rate.  Moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation.  These requirements could, in turn, lead to changes in the planning or operations of balancing authorities or organized markets in areas where the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities do business.  Violations of such requirements may subject Entergy Wholesale Commodities and the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties’ claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards.  To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergy’s regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy’s regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs.  Future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of CO


and other greenhouse gases or mix of generation sources could (i) result in significant additional costs to Entergy’s utility operating companies, their suppliers or customers, (ii) make some of Entergy’s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, (iii) result in the early retirement of generation facilities and stranded costs if Entergy’s utility operating companies are unable to fully recover the costs and investment in generation and (iv) could increase the difficulty that Entergy and its utility operating companies have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, each of which could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries.  In addition, lawsuits have occurred or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change.  These lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages.



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

In addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, potential physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wildfires, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, (such as increases in precipitation, drought, or changes in average temperatures), and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms.  Entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands.  A significant portion of the nation’s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by the physical impacts of climate change, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. Entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supply necessary for operations.

These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy System’s ability to meet peak customer demand, more frequent and longer lasting outages, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction.  Also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues.  Such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on Entergy’s, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’, System Energy’s, and the Utility operating companies’ financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

Continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business.

Water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to the Utility operating companies’, System Energy’s, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ business operations.  Entergy’s facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses.  Entergy’s Utility operating companies also own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities.  Accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to Entergy’s business operations.  Impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues.

Entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities.  Entergy also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under various provisions of the Clean Water Act and/or state water pollution control provisions.  Regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater aquifer volumes, and similar conditions.  The increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect Entergy and its subsidiaries.

Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect Entergy’s and its subsidiaries’ results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

To manage near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines.  As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges.  However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time.  In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged.  To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions,



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Entergy’s and its subsidiaries’ results of operations and financial position.

Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities.  As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position.

Entergy’s over-the-counter financial derivatives are subject to rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that are designed to promote transparency, mitigate systemic risk and protect against market abuse.  Entergy cannot predict the impact any proposed or not fully-implemented final rules will have on its ability to hedge its commodity price risk or on over-the-counter derivatives markets as a whole, but such rules and regulations could have a material effect on Entergy's risk exposure, as well as reduce market liquidity and further increase the cost of hedging activities.

Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities.  Reductions in Entergy’s or its subsidiaries’ credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy’s or its subsidiaries’ liquidity and financial position.

The Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.

The hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations.  Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries.  If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations.  In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties.  In addition, the credit commitments of Entergy’s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources.

Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased benefit plan costs.

The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy’s pension and postretirement benefit plans.  A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy’s benefit plan liabilities and also result in higher benefit costs. As the value of the assets decreases, the “expected return on assets” component of benefit costs decreases, resulting in higher benefits costs.  Additionally, asset losses are incorporated into benefit costs over time, thus increasing benefits costs.  Volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy’s planned levels of contributions in the future.  Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy’s pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding and recognition of higher liability carrying costs.  The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal regulations.  For further information regarding Entergy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the “

Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses.

Entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters.  The states in which the Utility operating companies operate, in particular Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments.  Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases.  Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk.

Terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, system failures or data breaches of Entergy’s and its subsidiaries’ or our suppliers’ technology systems may adversely affect Entergy’s results of operations.

Entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a business that requires evolving information technology systems that include sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software, network infrastructure and other technologies that are becoming more complex and may be subject to mandatory and prescriptive reliability and security standards. The functionality of Entergy’s technology systems depends on its own and its suppliers’ and their contractors’ technology.   Suppliers’ and their contractors’ technology systems to which Entergy is connected directly or indirectly support a variety of business processes and activities to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally identifiable information of customers and employees, and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems could result in loss of data or disruptions of operations.

There have been attacks and threats of attacks on energy infrastructure by cyber actors, including those associated with foreign governments.  As an operator of critical infrastructure, Entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, cyber attacks, and data breaches, whether as a direct or indirect act against one of Entergy’s generation, transmission or distribution facilities, operations centers, infrastructure, or information technology systems used to manage, monitor, and transport power to customers and perform day-to-day business functions.  An actual act could affect Entergy’s ability to operate, including its ability to operate the information technology systems and network infrastructure on which it relies to conduct business.

Given the rapid technological advancements of existing and emerging threats, Entergy’s technology systems remain inherently vulnerable despite implementations and enhancements of the multiple layers of security and controls.  If Entergy’s or its subsidiaries’ technology systems were compromised and unable to detect or recover in a timely fashion to a normal state of operations, Entergy or its subsidiaries could be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company’s well-being and could result in a loss of its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, suppliers, and others in Entergy’s care.  Although malware was discovered on Entergy’s business network in 2018, it was remediated on a timely basis and did not affect Entergy’s operational systems, generation plants (including nuclear), or transmission and distribution networks, nor did it have a material effect on Entergy’s business operations.

Any such attacks, failures or data breaches could have a material effect on Entergy’s and the Utility operating companies’ business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.  Insurance may not be adequate to cover losses that might arise in connection with these events.  Such events may also expose Entergy to an increased risk of litigation (and associated damages and fines).



Part I Item 1A & 1B

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

(Entergy New Orleans)

The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers taking gas service may adversely affect Entergy New Orleans’s results of operations and liquidity.

Gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility.  Distribution charges recover fixed costs on a volumetric basis and, thus, are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers.  When purchased gas cost charges increase due to higher gas procurement costs, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy New Orleans, which could adversely affect results of operations.  Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer’s bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers.  Entergy New Orleans’s cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs.

(System Energy)

System Energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues.

System Energy’s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf.  Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy.  The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which expires in November 2044.  System Energy’s financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf.  The Unit Power Sales Agreement is currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC, including a challenge with respect to System Energy’s authorized return on equity and capital structure and a request in separate proceeding for FERC to initiate a broader investigation of rates under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the proceedings.  The Utility operating companies have agreed to implement certain protocols for providing retail regulators with information regarding rates billed under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.

(Entergy Corporation)

As a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock.

Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries.  Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries.  Entergy Corporation’s ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries.  The subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any dividends or make distributions to Entergy Corporation.  The ability of such subsidiaries to make payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation depends on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries’ ability to pay such dividends or distributions.  Prior to providing funds to Entergy Corporation, such subsidiaries have financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and, in the case of Entergy Utility Holding Company and Entergy Texas, dividends and distributions on preferred securities.  Any distributions from the Registrant Subsidiaries other than Entergy Texas and System Energy

are paid directly to Entergy Utility Holding Company and are therefore subject to prior payment of distributions on its preferred securities.



ENTERGY ARKANSAS, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Results of Operations

2019 Compared to 2018

Net Income

Net income increased

$10.3 million

primarily due to higher retail electric price and lower nuclear refueling outage expenses, partially offset by lower volume/weather, higher interest expense, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses.

Operating Revenues

Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2019 to 2018:

Entergy Arkansas’s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income.  “Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income” includes the revenue variance associated with these items.

The return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers resulted from the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes through a tax adjustment rider beginning in April 2018.  In 2019, $126.3 million was returned to customers as compared to $367.7 million in 2018.  There was no effect on net income as the reduction in operating revenues in each period was offset by a reduction in income tax expense.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in formula rate plan rates effective with the first billing cycle of January 2019, as approved by the APSC.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan filing.

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease of 707 GWh, or 3%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales and a decrease in industrial usage.  The decrease in industrial usage is primarily due to a decrease in small industrial sales.

Other Income Statement Variances

Nuclear refueling outage expenses decreased primarily due to the amortization of lower costs associated with the most recent outages as compared to previous outages.



Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:

•

a decrease of $20.2 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to a lower scope of work performed in 2019 as compared to 2018;

•

the effects of recording in 2019 a final judgment to resolve claims in the ANO damages case against the DOE related to spent nuclear fuel storage costs.  The damages awarded include the reimbursement of approximately $11.9 million of spent nuclear fuel storage costs previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expense.  See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation; and

•

a decrease of $5.5 million

in vegetation maintenance costs.

The decrease was partially offset by:

•

an $11.2 million write-off in 2019 of specific costs related to the potential construction of scrubbers at the White Bluff plant;

•

an increase of $8.5 million in information technology expenses primarily due to higher costs related to applications and infrastructure support, enhanced cyber security, and upgrades and maintenance;

•

an increase of $7.4 million due to spending on initiatives to explore new customer products and services; and

•

an increase of $5.5 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to higher incentive-based compensation accruals in 2019 as compared to prior year.

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to increases in local franchise taxes and ad valorem taxes.  The increase in local franchise taxes is primarily due to higher electric retail revenues.  The increase in ad valorem taxes is primarily due to higher assessments and millage rates.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service and an increase in the ANO 1 and ANO 2 asset retirement cost assets.  See Note 9 to the financial statements for discussion of the increase in the asset retirement cost assets.

Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $350 million of 4.20% Series mortgage bonds in March 2019 and the issuance of $250 million of 4.00% Series mortgage bonds in May 2018.

The effective income tax rates were (21.6%) for 2019 and 669.7% for 2018.  The differences in the effective income tax rates versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates.

Cash Flow

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows:

2019 Compared to 2018

Operating Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $465.9 million in 2019 primarily due to:

•

a decrease in the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers in 2019 as compared to 2018.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act;

•

payments in 2018 of $135 million to the other Utility operating companies as a result of a compliance filing made in response to the FERC’s October 2018 order in the opportunity sales proceeding.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the opportunity sales proceeding;

•

income tax refunds of $34 million in 2019 compared to income tax payments of $44.4 million in 2018.  Entergy Arkansas had income tax refunds in 2019 and income tax payments in 2018 in accordance with an intercompany income tax allocation agreement.  The income tax refunds in 2019 resulted from the utilization of Entergy Arkansas’s net operating losses.  The income tax payments in 2018 primarily resulted from the settlement of the 2012-2013 audit;

•

a decrease of $44.1 million in spending on nuclear refueling outages in 2019; and

•

the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs.

The increase was partially offset by the timing of collection of receivables from customers and an increase of $11.8 million in pension contributions in 2019.  See “

Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Investing Activities

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $12.4 million in 2019 primarily due to:

•

a decrease of $32.1 million in nuclear construction expenditures primarily due to a lower scope of work performed on various nuclear projects in 2019 as compared to 2018;

•

a decrease of $25.8 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to a lower scope of work performed on various projects in 2019 as compared to 2018; and

•

a decrease of $13 million as a result of fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements in the Utility business, material and service deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle.

The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $35.6 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to investment in the reliability and infrastructure of Entergy Arkansas’s distribution system, including increased spending on advanced metering infrastructure, and an increase of $15.6 million in storm spending.

Financing Activities

Entergy Arkansas’s cash provided by financing activities decreased $468.9 million in 2019 primarily due to:

•

a $350 million capital contribution from Entergy Corporation in May 2018 in anticipation of the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers and upcoming planned capital investments;

•

the issuance of $250 million of 4.0% Series first mortgage bonds in May 2018;

•

money pool activity;

•

net repayments of long-term borrowings of $44.5 million in 2019 compared to net long-term borrowings of $34.7 million in 2018 on the Entergy Arkansas nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facility; and

•

an increase of $23.2 million in common equity distributions paid in 2019 primarily to maintain Entergy Arkansas’s capital structure.

The decrease was partially offset by:

•

the issuance of $350 million of 4.20% Series mortgage bonds in March 2019;

•

net repayments of short-term borrowings of $50 million on the Entergy Arkansas nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facility in 2018; and

•

the redemption of $31.4 million of preferred stock in 2018 in connection with the internal restructuring.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the internal restructuring and Note 6 to the financial statements for details of preferred stock activity.

Decreases in Entergy Arkansas’s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Arkansas’s payable to the money pool decreased by $161.1 million in 2019 compared to increasing by $16.6 million in 2018.  The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

See Note 5 to the financial statements for further details of long-term debt.

” in Entergy Arkansas’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow activities for 2018 compared to 2017.

Capital Structure

Entergy Arkansas’s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table.  The increase in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2019.

(a)

Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Arkansas.

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Arkansas uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas’s financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy Arkansas, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial statements. Entergy Arkansas also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Arkansas’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

Entergy Arkansas seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings.  To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a distribution, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure.  To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, Entergy Arkansas may issue incremental debt or reduce distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure.  In addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing distributions, Entergy Arkansas may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure.

Uses of Capital

Entergy Arkansas requires capital resources for:

•

construction and other capital investments;

•

debt maturities or retirements;

•

working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and

•

distribution and interest payments.



Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Following are the amounts of Entergy Arkansas’s planned construction and other capital investments.

Following are the amounts of Entergy Arkansas’s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments) and other purchase obligations.

(a)

Includes estimated interest payments.  Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.

(b)

Lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements.

(c)

Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services.  For Entergy Arkansas, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which are discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Arkansas currently expects to contribute approximately $32.5 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $509 thousand to its other postretirement health care and life insurance plans in 2020, although the 2020 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2020 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2020.  See “

Critical Accounting Estimates

– Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Arkansas has

$207.1 million

of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Arkansas includes specific investments, such as transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable economic growth; distribution spending to enhance reliability and improve service to customers, including advanced meters and related investments; resource planning, including potential generation projects; system improvements; investments in ANO 1 and 2; software and security; and other investments.  Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital.  Management provides more information on long-term debt maturities in Note 5 to the financial statements.



Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, Entergy Arkansas pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly.

Searcy Solar Facility

In March 2019, Entergy Arkansas announced that it signed an agreement for the purchase of an approximately 100 MW to-be-constructed solar energy facility that will be sited on approximately 800 acres in White County near Searcy, Arkansas.  The purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals from applicable federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies.  The project will be constructed by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources.  Entergy Arkansas will purchase the facility upon mechanical completion and after the other purchase contingencies have been met.  Closing is expected to occur by the end of 2021.  In May 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed a petition with the APSC seeking a finding that the transaction is in the public interest and requesting all necessary approvals.  In September 2019 other parties filed testimony largely supporting the resource acquisition but disputing Entergy Arkansas’s proposed method of cost recovery.  Entergy Arkansas filed its rebuttal testimony in October 2019.  In February 2020, Entergy Arkansas, the Attorney General, and the APSC general staff filed a partial settlement agreement asking the APSC to approve, based on the record in the proceeding, all issues except certain issues that are submitted to the APSC for determination.

Sources of Capital

Entergy Arkansas’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:

•

internally generated funds;

•

cash on hand;

•

debt or preferred membership interest issuances;

•

capital contributions; and

•

bank financing under new or existing facilities.

Entergy Arkansas may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest rates are favorable.

All debt and common and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy Arkansas require prior regulatory approval.  Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in Entergy Arkansas’s bond indentures and other agreements.  Entergy Arkansas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

Entergy Arkansas’s payables to the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years.

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

Entergy Arkansas has a credit facility in the amount of

$150 million

scheduled to expire in September 2024.  Entergy Arkansas also has a

$20 million

credit facility scheduled to expire in April 2020.  The

$150 million

credit facility includes fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against

$5 million

of the borrowing capacity of the facility.  As of December 31, 2019, there were no cash borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facilities.  In addition, Entergy Arkansas is a party to an uncommitted letter of credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to MISO.  As of December 31, 2019, a

$1 million

letter of credit was outstanding under Entergy Arkansas’s uncommitted letter of credit facility.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of the credit facilities.

2017 Formula Rate Plan Filing

In July 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2017 formula rate plan filing showing Entergy Arkansas’s projected earned return on common equity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 test period to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth.  The filing projected a $129.7 million revenue requirement increase to achieve Entergy Arkansas’s target earned return on common equity of 9.75%.  Entergy Arkansas’s formula rate plan is subject to a four percent annual revenue constraint and the projected annual revenue requirement increase exceeded the four percent, resulting in a proposed increase for the 2017 formula rate plan of $70.9 million.  In October 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC revised formula rate plan attachments that projected a $126.2 million revenue requirement increase based on acceptance of certain adjustments and recommendations made by the APSC staff and other intervenors.  The revised formula rate plan filing included a proposed $71.1 million revenue requirement increase based on a revision to the four percent constraint calculation.  In October 2017, Entergy Arkansas and the parties to the proceeding filed a joint motion to approve a unanimous settlement agreement resolving all issues in the proceeding and providing for recovery of certain 2017 and 2018 nuclear costs.  In December 2017 the APSC approved the settlement agreement and the $71.1 million revenue requirement increase, as well as Entergy Arkansas’s formula rate plan compliance tariff, and the rates became effective with the first billing cycle of January 2018.

2018 Formula Rate Plan Filing

In July 2018, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2018 formula rate plan filing to set its formula rate for the 2019 calendar year.  The filing showed Entergy Arkansas’s projected earned return on common equity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 test period to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth.  Additionally, the filing includes the first netting adjustment under the current formula rate plan for the historical test year 2017, reflecting the change in formula rate plan revenues associated with actual 2017 results when compared to the allowed rate of return on equity.  The filing includes a projected $73.4 million

revenue deficiency for 2019 and a $95.6 million revenue deficiency for the 2017 historical test year, for a total revenue requirement of $169 million for this filing.  By operation of the formula rate plan, Entergy Arkansas’s recovery of the revenue requirement is subject to a four percent annual revenue constraint.  Because Entergy Arkansas’s revenue requirement in this filing exceeds the constraint, the resulting increase is limited to four percent of total revenue, which originally was $65.4 million but was increased to $66.7 million based upon the APSC staff’s updated calculation of 2018 revenue.  In October 2018, Entergy Arkansas and the parties to the proceeding filed joint motions to approve a partial settlement agreement as to certain factual issues and agreed to brief contested legal issues.  In November 2018 the APSC held a hearing and was briefed on a certain contested legal issue.  In December 2018 the APSC issued a decision related to the initial legal brief, approved the



Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

partial settlement agreement and $66.7 million revenue requirement increase, as well as Entergy Arkansas’s formula rate plan, with updated rates going into effect for the first billing cycle of January 2019.

2019 Formula Rate Plan Filing

In July 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2019 formula rate plan filing to set its formula rate for the 2020 calendar year.  The filing contained an evaluation of Entergy Arkansas’s earnings for the projected year 2020 and a netting adjustment for the historical year 2018.  The total proposed formula rate plan rider revenue change designed to produce a target rate of return on common equity of 9.75% is $15.3 million, which is based upon a deficiency of approximately $61.9 million for the 2020 projected year, netted with a credit of approximately $46.6 million in the 2018 historical year netting adjustment.  During 2018 Entergy Arkansas experienced higher-than expected sales volume, and actual costs were lower than forecasted.  These changes, coupled with a reduced income tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, resulted in the credit for the historical year netting adjustment.  In the fourth quarter 2018 Entergy Arkansas recorded a provision of $35.1 million that reflected the estimate of the historical year netting adjustment that was expected to be included in the 2019 filing.  In 2019, Entergy Arkansas recorded additional provisions totaling $11.5 million to reflect the updated estimate of the historical year netting adjustment included in the 2019 filing.  In October 2019 other parties in the proceeding filed their errors and objections requesting certain adjustments to Entergy Arkansas’s filing that would reduce or eliminate Entergy Arkansas’s proposed revenue change. Entergy Arkansas filed its response addressing the requested adjustments in October 2019.  In its response, Entergy Arkansas accepted certain of the adjustments recommended by the General Staff of the APSC that would reduce the proposed formula rate plan rider revenue change to $14 million.  Entergy Arkansas disputed the remaining adjustments proposed by the parties.  In October 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed a unanimous settlement agreement with the other parties in the proceeding seeking APSC approval of a revised total formula rate plan rider revenue change of $10.1 million.  In its July 2019 formula rate plan filing, Entergy Arkansas proposed to recover an $11.2 million regulatory asset, amortized over five years, associated with specific costs related to the potential construction of scrubbers at the White Bluff plant.  Although Entergy Arkansas does not concede that the regulatory asset lacks merit, for purposes of reaching a settlement on the total formula rate plan rider amount, Entergy Arkansas agreed not to include the White Bluff scrubber regulatory asset cost in the 2019 formula rate plan filing or future filings.  Entergy Arkansas recorded a write-off in 2019 of the $11.2 million White Bluff scrubber regulatory asset.  In December 2019, the APSC approved the settlement as being in the public interest and approved Entergy Arkansas’s compliance tariff effective with the first billing cycle of January 2020.

Internal Restructuring

In November 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed an application with the APSC seeking authorization to undertake a restructuring that would result in the transfer of substantially all of the assets and operations of Entergy Arkansas to a new entity, which would ultimately be owned by an existing Entergy subsidiary holding company.  In July 2018, Entergy Arkansas filed a settlement, reached by all parties in the APSC proceeding, resolving all issues.  The APSC approved the settlement agreement and restructuring in August 2018.  Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Entergy Arkansas will credit retail customers

$39.6 million

over six years, beginning in 2019.  Entergy Arkansas also received the required FERC and NRC approvals.

In November 2018, Entergy Arkansas undertook a multi-step restructuring, including the following:

•

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. redeemed its outstanding preferred stock at the aggregate redemption price of approximately

$32.7 million

.

•

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. converted from an Arkansas corporation to a Texas corporation.

•

Under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Entergy Arkansas, Inc. allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy Arkansas Power, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Entergy Arkansas Power), and Entergy Arkansas Power assumed substantially all of the liabilities of Entergy Arkansas, Inc., in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC.  Entergy Arkansas, Inc. remained in existence and held the membership interests in Entergy Arkansas Power.



Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

•

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. contributed the membership interests in Entergy Arkansas Power to an affiliate (Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and subsidiary of Entergy Corporation).  As a result of the contribution, Entergy Arkansas Power is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC.

In December 2018, Entergy Arkansas, Inc. changed its name to Entergy Utility Property, Inc., and Entergy Arkansas Power then changed its name to Entergy Arkansas, LLC.  Entergy Arkansas, LLC holds substantially all of the assets, and assumed substantially all of the liabilities, of Entergy Arkansas, Inc.  The transaction was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)

In September 2016, Entergy Arkansas filed an application seeking a finding from the APSC that Entergy Arkansas’s deployment of AMI is in the public interest.  Entergy Arkansas proposed to replace existing meters with advanced meters that enable two-way data communication; design and build a secure and reliable network to support such communications; and implement support systems.  AMI is intended to serve as the foundation of Entergy Arkansas’s modernized power grid.  The filing included an estimate of implementation costs for AMI of

$208 million

and identified a number of quantified and unquantified benefits.  Entergy Arkansas proposed a 15-year depreciable life for the new advanced meters, the three-year deployment of which began in January 2019.  Deployment of the communications network began in 2018.  In October 2017 the APSC issued an order finding that Entergy Arkansas’s AMI deployment is in the public interest and approving the settlement agreement subject to a minor modification.  Entergy Arkansas is recovering the AMI deployment costs and the quantified benefits through its formula rate plan.  Entergy Arkansas will recover the undepreciated balance of its existing meters through a regulatory asset to be amortized over 15 years, as approved by the APSC.

Production Cost Allocation Rider

The APSC approved a production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to Entergy Arkansas as a result of the System Agreement proceedings, which are discussed in the “

System Agreement Cost Equalization Proceedings

” section in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Energy Cost Recovery Rider

Entergy Arkansas’s retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly customer bills.  The rider utilizes the prior calendar-year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over- or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy costs for the prior calendar year.  The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs.

In January 2014, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion with the APSC relating to its upcoming energy cost rate redetermination filing that was made in March 2014.  In that motion, Entergy Arkansas requested that the APSC authorize Entergy Arkansas to exclude from the redetermination of its 2014 energy cost rate $65.9 million of incremental fuel and replacement energy costs incurred in 2013 as a result of the ANO stator incident.  Entergy Arkansas requested that the APSC authorize Entergy Arkansas to retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance, with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information was available regarding various claims associated with the ANO stator incident.  In February 2014 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas’s request to retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance.  In July 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed for a change in rates pursuant to its formula rate plan rider.  In that proceeding, the APSC approved a settlement agreement agreed upon by the parties, including a provision that requires Entergy Arkansas to initiate a regulatory proceeding for the purpose of recovering funds currently withheld from rates and related to the stator incident, including the $65.9 million of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs previously noted, subject to



Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

certain timelines and conditions set forth in the settlement agreement.  See the “

ANO Damage, Outage, and NRC Reviews

” section in Note 8 to the financial statements for further discussion of the ANO stator incident.

In March 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an increase in the rate from $0.01164 per kWh to $0.01547 per kWh.  The APSC staff filed testimony in March 2017 recommending that the redetermined rate be implemented with the first billing cycle of April 2017 under the normal operation of the tariff.  Accordingly, the redetermined rate went into effect on March 31, 2017 pursuant to the tariff.  In July 2017 the Arkansas Attorney General requested additional information to support certain of the costs included in Entergy Arkansas’s 2017 energy cost rate redetermination.

In March 2018, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an increase in the rate from $0.01547 per kWh to $0.01882 per kWh.  The Arkansas Attorney General filed a response to Entergy Arkansas’s annual redetermination filing requesting that the APSC suspend the proposed tariff to investigate the amount of the redetermination or, alternatively, to allow recovery subject to refund. Among the reasons the Attorney General cited for suspension were questions pertaining to how Entergy Arkansas forecasted sales and potential implications of the Tax Act.  Entergy Arkansas replied to the Attorney General’s filing and stated that, to the extent there are questions pertaining to its load forecasting or the operation of the energy cost recovery rider, those issues exceed the scope of the instant rate redetermination. Entergy Arkansas also stated that potential effects of the Tax Act are appropriately considered in the APSC’s separate proceeding regarding potential implications of the tax law.  The APSC general staff filed a reply to the Attorney General’s filing and agreed that Entergy Arkansas’s filing complied with the terms of the energy cost recovery rider.  The redetermined rate became effective with the first billing cycle of April 2018.  Subsequently in April 2018 the APSC issued an order declining to suspend Entergy Arkansas’s energy cost recovery rider rate and declining to require further investigation at that time of the issues suggested by the Attorney General in the proceeding.  Following a period of discovery, the Attorney General filed a supplemental response in October 2018 raising new issues with Entergy Arkansas’s March 2018 rate redetermination and asserting that $45.7 million of the increase should be collected subject to refund pending further investigation.  Entergy Arkansas filed to dismiss the Attorney General’s supplemental response, the APSC general staff filed a motion to strike the Attorney General’s filing, and the Attorney General filed a supplemental response disputing Entergy Arkansas and the APSC staff’s filing.  Applicable APSC rules and processes authorize its general staff to initiate periodic audits of Entergy Arkansas’s energy cost recovery rider.  In late-2018, the APSC general staff notified Entergy Arkansas it has initiated an audit of the 2017 fuel costs.  The time in which the audit will be complete is uncertain at this time.

In March 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected a decrease from $0.01882 per kWh to $0.01462 per kWh and became effective with the first billing cycle in April 2019.  In March 2019 the Arkansas Attorney General filed a response to Entergy Arkansas’s annual adjustment and included with its filing a motion for investigation of alleged overcharges to customers in connection with the FERC’s October 2018 order in the opportunity sales proceeding.  Entergy Arkansas filed its response to the Attorney General’s motion in April 2019 in which Entergy Arkansas stated its intent to initiate a proceeding to address recovery issues related to the October 2018 FERC order.  In May 2019, Entergy Arkansas initiated the opportunity sales recovery proceeding, discussed below, and requested that the APSC establish that proceeding as the single designated proceeding in which interested parties may assert claims related to the appropriate retail rate treatment of the FERC October 2018 order and related FERC orders in the opportunity sales proceeding.  In June 2019 the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas’s request and also denied the Attorney General’s motion in the energy cost recovery proceeding seeking an investigation into Entergy Arkansas’s annual energy cost recovery rider adjustment and referred the evaluation of such matters to the opportunity sales recovery proceeding.

Opportunity Sales Proceeding

In June 2009 the LPSC filed a complaint requesting that the FERC determine that certain of Entergy Arkansas’s sales of electric energy to third parties: (a) violated the provisions of the System Agreement that allocated the energy generated by Entergy System resources; (b) imprudently denied the Entergy System and its ultimate consumers the benefits of low-cost Entergy System generating capacity; and (c) violated the provision of the System Agreement that prohibited sales to third parties by individual companies absent an offer of a right-of-first-refusal to other Utility operating companies.   The LPSC’s complaint challenged sales made beginning in 2002 and requested refunds.  In July 2009 the Utility operating companies filed a response to the complaint arguing among other things that the System Agreement contemplates that the Utility operating companies may make sales to third parties for their own account, subject to the requirement that those sales be included in the load (or load shape) for the applicable Utility operating company.  The FERC subsequently ordered a hearing in the proceeding.

After a hearing, the ALJ issued an initial decision in December 2010.  The ALJ found that the System Agreement allowed for Entergy Arkansas to make the sales to third parties but concluded that the sales should be accounted for in the same manner as joint account sales.  The ALJ concluded that “shareholders” should make refunds of the damages to the Utility operating companies, along with interest.  Entergy disagreed with several aspects of the ALJ’s initial decision and in January 2011 filed with the FERC exceptions to the decision.

The FERC issued a decision in June 2012 and held that, while the System Agreement is ambiguous, it does provide authority for individual Utility operating companies to make opportunity sales for their own account and Entergy Arkansas made and priced these sales in good faith.  The FERC found, however, that the System Agreement does not provide authority for an individual Utility operating company to allocate the energy associated with such opportunity sales as part of its load but provides a different allocation authority.  The FERC further found that the after-the-fact accounting methodology used to allocate the energy used to supply the sales was inconsistent with the System Agreement.  The FERC in its decision established further hearing procedures to quantify the effect of repricing the opportunity sales in accordance with the FERC’s June 2012 decision.  The hearing was held in May 2013 and the ALJ issued an initial decision in August 2013.  The LPSC, the APSC, the City Council, and FERC staff filed briefs on exceptions and/or briefs opposing exceptions.  Entergy filed a brief on exceptions requesting that the FERC reverse the initial decision and a brief opposing certain exceptions taken by the LPSC and FERC staff.

In April 2016 the FERC issued orders addressing requests for rehearing filed in July 2012 and the ALJ’s August 2013 initial decision.  The first order denied Entergy’s request for rehearing and affirmed the FERC’s earlier rulings that Entergy’s original methodology for allocating energy costs to the opportunity sales was incorrect and, as a result, Entergy Arkansas must make payments to the other Utility operating companies to put them in the same position that they would have been in absent the incorrect allocation.  The FERC clarified that interest should be included with the payments.  The second order affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the rulings in the ALJ’s August 2013 initial decision regarding the methodology that should be used to calculate the payments Entergy Arkansas is to make to the other Utility operating companies.  The FERC affirmed the ALJ’s ruling that a full re-run of intra-system bills should be performed but required that methodology be modified so that the sales have the same priority for purposes of energy allocation as joint account sales.  The FERC reversed the ALJ’s decision that any payments by Entergy Arkansas should be reduced by

20%

.  The FERC also reversed the ALJ’s decision that adjustments to other System Agreement service schedules and excess bandwidth payments should not be taken into account when calculating the payments to be made by Entergy Arkansas.  The FERC held that such adjustments and excess bandwidth payments should be taken into account but ordered further proceedings before an ALJ to address whether a cap on any reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and to implement the other adjustments to the calculation methodology.

In May 2016, Entergy Services filed a request for rehearing of the FERC’s April 2016 order arguing that payments made by Entergy Arkansas should be reduced as a result of the timing of the LPSC’s approval of certain contracts.  Entergy Services also filed a request for clarification and/or rehearing of the FERC’s April 2016 order addressing the ALJ’s August 2013 initial decision.  The APSC and the LPSC also filed requests for rehearing of the FERC’s April 2016 order.

In September 2017 the FERC issued an order denying the request for rehearing on the issue



Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

of whether any payments by Entergy Arkansas to the other Utility operating companies should be reduced due to the timing of the LPSC’s approval of Entergy Arkansas’s wholesale baseload contract with Entergy Louisiana.  In November 2017 the FERC issued an order denying all of the remaining requests for rehearing of the April 2016 order.  In November 2017, Entergy Services filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit of the FERC’s orders in the first two phases of the opportunity sales case.  In December 2017 the D.C. Circuit granted Entergy Services’ request to hold the appeal in abeyance pending final resolution of the related proceeding before the FERC.  In January 2018 the APSC and the LPSC filed separate petitions for review in the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit consolidated the appeals with Entergy Services’ appeal and held all of the appeals in abeyance pending final resolution of the related proceeding before the FERC.

The hearing required by the FERC’s April 2016 order was held in May 2017.  In July 2017 the ALJ issued an initial decision addressing whether a cap on any reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and whether to implement the other adjustments to the calculation methodology.  In August 2017 the Utility operating companies, the LPSC, the APSC, and FERC staff filed individual briefs on exceptions challenging various aspects of the initial decision.  In September 2017 the Utility operating companies, the LPSC, the APSC, the MPSC, the City Council, and FERC staff filed separate briefs opposing exceptions taken by various parties.

Based on testimony previously submitted in the case and its assessment of the April 2016 FERC orders, in the first quarter 2016, Entergy Arkansas recorded a liability of $87 million, which included interest, for its estimated increased costs and payment to the other Utility operating companies, and a deferred fuel regulatory asset of $75 million.  Following its assessment of the course of the proceedings, including the FERC’s denial of rehearing in November 2017 described above, in the fourth quarter 2017, Entergy Arkansas recorded an additional liability of $35 million and a regulatory asset of $31 million.

In October 2018 the FERC issued an order addressing the ALJ’s July 2017 initial decision.  The FERC reversed the ALJ’s decision to cap the reduction in Entergy Arkansas’s payment to account for the increased bandwidth payments that Entergy Arkansas made to the other operating companies.  The FERC also reversed the ALJ’s decision that Grand Gulf sales from January through September 2000 should be included in the calculation of Entergy Arkansas’s payment.  The FERC affirmed on other grounds the ALJ’s rejection of the LPSC’s claim that certain joint account sales should be accounted for as part of the calculation of Entergy Arkansas’s payment.  In November 2018 the LPSC requested rehearing of the FERC’s October 2018 decision.  In December 2019 the FERC denied the LPSC’s request for rehearing.

In December 2018, Entergy made a compliance filing in response to the FERC’s October 2018 order.  The compliance filing provided a final calculation of Entergy Arkansas’s payments to the other Utility operating companies, including interest.   No protests were filed in response to the December 2018 compliance filing.  The December 2018 compliance filing is pending FERC action.  Refunds and interest in the following amounts were paid by Entergy Arkansas to the other operating companies in December 2018:

Entergy Arkansas previously recognized a regulatory asset with a balance of

$116 million

as of December 31, 2018 for a portion of the payments due as a result of this proceeding.



Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

In February 2019 the LPSC filed a new complaint relating to two issues that were raised in the opportunity sales proceeding, but that, in its October 2018 order, the FERC held were outside the scope of the proceeding.  In March 2019, Entergy Services filed an answer and motion to dismiss the new complaint.  In November 2019 the FERC issued an order denying the LPSC’s complaint.  The order concluded that the settlement agreement approved by FERC in December 2015 terminating the System Agreement barred the LPSC’s new complaint.

In May 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed an application and supporting testimony with the APSC requesting approval of a special rider tariff to recover the costs of these payments from its retail customers over a 24-month period.  The application requested that the APSC approve the rider to take effect within 30 days or, if suspended by the APSC as allowed by commission rule, approve the rider to take effect in the first billing cycle of the first month occurring 30 days after issuance of the APSC’s order approving the rider.  In June 2019 the APSC suspended Entergy Arkansas’s tariff and granted Entergy Arkansas’s motion asking the APSC to establish the proceeding as the single designated proceeding in which interested parties may assert claims related to the appropriate retail rate treatment of the FERC’s October 2018 order and related FERC orders in the opportunity sales proceeding.  In January 2020 the APSC adopted a procedural schedule with a hearing in April 2020.  In January 2020 the Attorney General and Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. filed a joint motion seeking to dismiss Entergy Arkansas’s application alleging that the APSC, in a prior proceeding, ruled on the issues addressed in the application and determined that Entergy Arkansas’s requested relief violates the filed rate doctrine and the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking.  Entergy Arkansas responded to the joint motion in February 2020 rebutting these arguments, including demonstrating that the claims in this proceeding differ substantially from those the APSC addressed previously and that the payment resulting from a FERC tariff violation for which Entergy Arkansas seeks retail cost recovery in this proceeding differs materially from the refunds resulting from a FERC tariff amendment that the APSC previously rejected on filed rate doctrine and the retroactive ratemaking grounds.  In addition, in January 2020 the Attorney General and Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. filed testimony opposing the recovery by Entergy Arkansas of the opportunity sales payment but also claiming that certain components of the payment should be segregated and refunded to customers.

Net Metering Legislation

An Arkansas law was enacted effective July 2019 that, among other things, expands the definition of a “net metering customer” to include two additional types of customers: (1) customers that lease net metering facilities, subject to certain leasing arrangements, and (2) government entities or other entities exempt from state and federal income taxes that enter into a service contract for a net metering facility.  The latter provision would allow eligible entities, many of whom are small and large general service customers, to purchase renewable energy directly from third party providers and receive bill credits for these purchases.  The APSC was given authority under this law to address certain matters, such as cost shifting and the appropriate compensation for net metered energy, and has initiated proceedings for this purpose.  Because of the size and number of customers eligible under this new law, there is a risk of loss of load and the shifting of costs to customers.  A hearing was held in December 2019, with utilities, cooperatives, the Arkansas Attorney General, industrial customers, and Entergy Arkansas advocating the need for establishment of a reasonable rate structure that takes into account impacts to non-net metering customers.  Separately, as directed by the APSC general staff, the APSC opened a proceeding to compel utilities to amend their net metering tariffs to incorporate the provisions of the legislation that the APSC general staff considered “black letter law.”  Entergy Arkansas, the Arkansas Attorney General, and other intervenors opposed this directive pending the development of the rules for implementation that are being considered in the separate net metering rulemaking docket.  Nevertheless, reserving its rights, Entergy Arkansas has complied with the directive to amend its tariffs.  Asserting procedural and due process violations, in January 2020, Entergy Arkansas and the Arkansas Attorney General separately appealed certain APSC orders in this proceeding.

Nuclear Matters

Entergy Arkansas owns and, through an affiliate, operates the ANO 1 and ANO 2 nuclear power plants.  Entergy Arkansas is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating nuclear plants.  These include risks related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements, both for capital investments and operational needs, to position Entergy’s nuclear fleet to meet its operational goals, including the financial requirements to address emerging issues like stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the plant systems and the Fukushima event; regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license renewal and amendments, and decommissioning; the performance and capacity factors of these nuclear plants; the availability of interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets and earnings to complete decommissioning of each site when required; and limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events such as a nuclear accident.  In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of either ANO 1 or ANO 2, Entergy Arkansas may be required to file with the APSC a rate mechanism to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.  ANO 1’s operating license expires in 2034 and ANO 2’s operating license expires in 2038.

Environmental Risks

Entergy Arkansas’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes that Entergy Arkansas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in “

Regulation of Entergy’s Business

-

Environmental Regulation

” in Part I, Item 1.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of Entergy Arkansas’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Arkansas’s financial position or results of operations.

In the first quarter 2019, Entergy Arkansas recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liabilities for ANO 1 and ANO 2 as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study.  The revised estimates resulted in a $126.2 million increase in its decommissioning cost liabilities, along with corresponding increases in the related asset retirement cost assets that will be depreciated over the remaining lives of the units.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy Arkansas’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.   See the “

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

ENTERGY LOUISIANA, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Results of Operations

2019 Compared to 2018

Net Income

Net income increased $15.9 million primarily due to higher retail electric price.  The increase was partially offset by an income tax benefit recognized in 2018 as a result of the settlement of the 2012-2013 IRS audit, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher other operation and maintenance expenses, lower volume/weather, and higher interest expense.

Operating Revenues

Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2019 to 2018:

Entergy Louisiana’s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income.  “Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income” includes the revenue variance associated with these items.

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in formula rate plan revenues effective September 2018 and an interim increase in formula rate plan revenues effective June 2019 due to the inclusion of the first-year revenue requirement for the St. Charles Power Station, each as approved by the LPSC.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan proceedings.

The return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers resulted from the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes through changes in the formula rate plan effective May 2018.  In 2019, $38.6 million was returned to customers as compared to $141.1 million in 2018.  There was no effect on net income as the reduction in operating revenues was offset by a reduction in income tax expense.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease of 673 GWh, or 3%, in billed electricity usage for residential and commercial customers, including the effect of less favorable weather.  The decrease was partially offset by an increase in industrial usage primarily due to an increase in demand from expansion projects, primarily in the chemicals and transportation industries.



Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Other Income Statement Variances

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:

•

a $14.8 million gain in 2018 from the sale of Willow Glen Power Station;

•

an increase of $12.7 million in information technology costs primarily due to higher costs related to applications and infrastructure support, enhanced cyber security, and upgrades and maintenance;

•

an increase of $12.4 million in spending on initiatives to explore new customer products and services; and

•

an increase of $9.6 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to higher incentive-based compensation accruals in 2019 as compared to prior year.

The increase was partially offset by:

•

a decrease of $8.5 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to a lower scope of work performed during plant outages in 2019 as compared to 2018; and

•

the effects of recording in 2019 the final judgment to resolve claims in the River Bend damages case against the DOE related to spent nuclear fuel storage costs.  The damages awarded include the reimbursement of $5.2 million of spent nuclear fuel storage costs previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expense.  See Note 8 to the financial statements for a discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation.

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to increases in ad valorem taxes.  Ad valorem taxes increased primarily due to higher assessments.

Depreciation and

amortization

expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service, including the St. Charles Power Station, which was placed into service in May 2019.

Other regulatory charges (credits) include regulatory charges of $73.1 million recorded in 2018 to reflect the effects of a provision in the settlement reached in the formula rate plan extension proceeding to return the benefits of the lower federal income tax rate in 2018 to customers.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the formula rate plan extension proceeding.

Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $525 million of 4.20% Series mortgage bonds in March 2019.

The effective income tax rates were 15% for 2019 and (8.8%) for 2018.  The difference in the effective income tax rate of 15% versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2019 was primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes and book and tax differences related to the non-taxable income distributions earned on preferred membership interests.  The difference in the effective income tax rate of (8.8%) versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2018 was primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes and an IRS audit settlement for the 2012-2013 tax returns.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rates of 21% to the effective income tax rates.

Income Tax Legislation

See the “

Income Tax Legislation

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows:

2019 Compared to 2018

Operating Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $159.2 million in 2019 primarily due to:

•

income tax payments of $15.3 million in 2019 compared to $105.2 million in income tax refunds in 2018.  Entergy Louisiana had income tax payments in 2019 and income tax refunds in 2018 in accordance with an intercompany tax allocation agreement.  The income tax refunds in 2018 resulted from the utilization of Entergy Louisiana’s net operating losses;

•

an increase of $65.2 million in spending on nuclear refueling outages;

•

the receipt of $58.6 million in 2018 from Entergy Arkansas as a result of a compliance filing made in response to the FERC’s October 2018 order in the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales proceeding.  The $58.6 million was credited to Entergy Louisiana customers in 2019.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the opportunity sales proceeding;

•

the timing of payments to vendors;

•

an increase of $25.7 million in storm expenses in 2019;

•

an increase of $24.5 million in interest paid; and

•

the timing of collection of receivables from customers.

The decrease was partially offset by a decrease in return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers and the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the effects and the regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.



Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Investing Activities

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $224.6 million in 2019 primarily due to a decrease of $320 million in fossil-fueled generation expenditures, primarily due to lower spending on the St. Charles Power Station and Lake Charles Power Station projects in 2019 and money pool activity.  The decrease was partially offset by:

•

an increase of $63.6 million in transmission expenditures primarily due to a higher scope of work performed in 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018;

•

an increase of $63.1 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to investment in the reliability and infrastructure of Entergy Louisiana’s distribution system, including increased spending on advanced metering infrastructure; and

•

an increase of $46.5 million in storm spending in 2019.

Decreases in Entergy Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $46.8 million in 2019 compared to increasing by $35.7 million in 2018.  The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

Financing Activities

Net cash flow provided by financing activities decreased $114.2 million in 2019 primarily due to:

•

the issuance of $750 million of 4.00% Series mortgage bonds in March 2018.  A portion of the proceeds was used to repay $375 million of 6.0% Series mortgage bonds in May 2018;

•

the issuance of $600 million of 4.20% Series mortgage bonds in August 2018.  A portion of the proceeds was used to repay $300 million of 6.5% Series mortgage bonds in September 2018; and

•

an increase of $80 million in common equity distributions in 2019 primarily to maintain Entergy Louisiana’s capital structure.

The decrease was partially offset by:

•

the issuance of $525 million of 4.20% Series mortgage bonds in March 2019;

•

money pool activity; and

•

net repayments of short-term borrowings of $43.5 million in 2018 on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entities’ credit facilities.

Increases in Entergy Louisiana’s payable to the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana’s payable to the money pool increased by $82.8 million in 2019.

Capital Structure

Entergy Louisiana’s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table.



Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

(a)

Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Louisiana.

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents.  Debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion.  Capital consists of debt and common equity.  Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents.  Entergy Louisiana uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Louisiana’s financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy Louisiana, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial statements.  Entergy Louisiana also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Louisiana’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Louisiana’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

Entergy Louisiana seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings.  To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a distribution, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure.  To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, Entergy Louisiana may issue incremental debt or reduce distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure.  In addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing distributions, Entergy Louisiana may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure.

Uses of Capital

Entergy Louisiana requires capital resources for:

•

construction and other capital investments;

•

debt maturities or retirements;

•

working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and

•

distribution and interest payments.

Following are the amounts of Entergy Louisiana’s planned construction and other capital investments.



Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Following are the amounts of Entergy Louisiana’s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments) and other purchase obligations.

(a)

Includes estimated interest payments.  Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.

(b)

Lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements.

(c)

Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services.  For Entergy Louisiana, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Vidalia purchased power agreement and the Unit Power Sales Agreement, both of which are discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Louisiana currently expects to contribute approximately $38.8 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $18.5 million to its other postretirement health care and life insurance plans in 2020, although the 2020 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2020 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2020.  See “

Critical Accounting Estimates

-

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

Also, in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Louisiana has $808.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Louisiana includes specific investments, such as the Washington Parish Energy Center and Lake Charles Power Station, each discussed below; transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable economic growth; distribution spending to enhance reliability and improve service to customers, including investment to support advanced metering; resource planning, including potential generation projects; system improvements; investments in River Bend and Waterford 3; software and security; and other investments.  Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources.  Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above.  The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital.

As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, Entergy Louisiana pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly.



Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Lake Charles Power Station

In November 2016, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking certification that the public convenience and necessity would be served by the construction of the Lake Charles Power Station, a nominal 994 megawatt combined-cycle generating unit in Westlake, Louisiana, on land adjacent to the existing Nelson plant in Calcasieu Parish.  The current estimated cost of the Lake Charles Power Station is $872 million, including estimated costs of transmission interconnection and other related costs.  In May 2017 the parties to the proceeding agreed to an uncontested stipulation finding that construction of the Lake Charles Power Station is in the public interest and authorizing an in-service rate recovery plan.  In July 2017 the LPSC issued an order unanimously approving the stipulation and approved certification of the unit.  Construction is in progress and commercial operation is expected to occur by mid-2020.

Washington Parish Energy Center

In April 2017, Entergy Louisiana signed an agreement with a subsidiary of Calpine Corporation for the construction and purchase of a peaking plant.  Calpine will construct the plant, which will consist of two natural gas-fired combustion turbine units with a total nominal capacity of approximately 361 MW.  The plant, named the Washington Parish Energy Center, will be located in Bogalusa, Louisiana.  Subject to regulatory approvals, Entergy Louisiana will purchase the plant once it is complete for an estimated total investment of approximately $261 million, including transmission and other related costs.  In May 2017, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking certification of the plant.  In April 2018 the parties reached a settlement recommending certification and cost recovery through the additional capacity mechanism of the formula rate plan, consistent with prior LPSC precedent with respect to the certification and recovery of plants previously acquired by Entergy Louisiana.  The LPSC issued an order approving the settlement in May 2018.  Construction is in progress and commercial operation is expected to occur by the end of 2020.

Sources of Capital

Entergy Louisiana’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:

•

internally generated funds;

•

cash on hand;

•

debt or preferred membership interest issuances;

•

capital contributions; and

•

bank financing under new or existing facilities.

Entergy Louisiana may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest rates are favorable.

All debt and common and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy Louisiana require prior regulatory approval.  Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements.  Entergy Louisiana has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

Entergy Louisiana’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years.

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.



Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Entergy Louisiana has a credit facility in the amount of $350 million scheduled to expire in September 2024.  The credit facility includes fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against $15 million of the borrowing capacity of the facility.  As of December 31, 2019, there were no cash borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility.   In addition, Entergy Louisiana is a party to an uncommitted letter of credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to MISO.  As of December 31, 2019, a $12.3 million letter of credit was outstanding under Entergy Louisiana’s uncommitted letter of credit facility.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facilities.

The Entergy Louisiana nuclear fuel company variable interest entities have two separate credit facilities, each in the amount of $105 million and scheduled to expire in September 2021.  As of December 31, 2019, $70.3 million of loans were outstanding under the credit facility for the Entergy Louisiana River Bend nuclear fuel company variable interest entity.  As of December 31, 2019, $49.9 million in loans were outstanding under the Entergy Louisiana Waterford nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facility.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facilities.

Entergy Louisiana obtained authorizations from the FERC through November 2020 for the following:

•

short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $450 million at any time outstanding;

•

long-term borrowings and security issuances; and

•

borrowings by its nuclear fuel company variable interest entities.

See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Louisiana’s short-term borrowing limits.

Hurricane Isaac

In June 2014 the LPSC voted to approve a series of orders which (i) quantified $290.8 million of Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs as prudently incurred; (ii) determined $290 million as the level of storm reserves to be re-established; (iii) authorized Entergy Louisiana to utilize Louisiana Act 55 financing for Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs; and (iv) granted other requested relief associated with storm reserves and Act 55 financing of Hurricane Isaac system restoration costs.  Entergy Louisiana committed to pass on to customers a minimum of $30.8 million of customer benefits through annual customer credits of approximately $6.2 million for five years.  Approvals for the Act 55 financings were obtained from the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation and the Louisiana State Bond Commission.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the August 2014 issuance of bonds under Act 55 of the Louisiana Legislature.

Little Gypsy Repowering Project

In April 2007, Entergy Louisiana announced that it intended to pursue the solid fuel repowering of a 538 MW unit at its Little Gypsy plant.  In March 2009 the LPSC voted in favor of a motion directing Entergy Louisiana to temporarily suspend the repowering project and, based upon an analysis of the project’s economic viability, to make a recommendation regarding whether to proceed with the project.  This action was based upon a number of factors including the recent decline in natural gas prices, as well as environmental concerns, the unknown costs of carbon legislation and changes in the capital/financial markets.  In April 2009, Entergy Louisiana complied with the LPSC’s directive and recommended that the project be suspended for an extended period of time of three years or more.  In May 2009 the LPSC issued an order declaring that Entergy Louisiana’s decision to place the Little Gypsy project into a longer-term suspension of three years or more is in the public interest and prudent.

In October 2009, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking permission to cancel the Little Gypsy repowering project and seeking project cost recovery over a five-year period.  In June 2010 and August 2010, the LPSC staff and intervenors filed testimony.  The LPSC staff (1) agreed that it was prudent to move the project from long-term suspension to cancellation and that the timing of the decision to suspend on a longer-term basis was not imprudent; (2) indicated that, except for $0.8 million in compensation-related costs, the costs incurred should be deemed prudent;



Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

(3) recommended recovery from customers over ten years but stated that the LPSC may want to consider 15 years; (4) allowed for recovery of carrying costs and earning a return on project costs, but at a reduced rate approximating the cost of debt, while also acknowledging that the LPSC may consider ordering no return; and (5) indicated that Entergy Louisiana should be directed to securitize project costs, if legally feasible and in the public interest.  In the third quarter 2010, in accordance with accounting standards, Entergy Louisiana determined that it was probable that the Little Gypsy repowering project would be abandoned and accordingly reclassified $199.8 million of project costs from construction work in progress to a regulatory asset.  A hearing on the issues, except for cost allocation among customer classes, was held before the ALJ in November 2010.  In January 2011 all parties participated in a mediation on the disputed issues, resulting in a settlement of all disputed issues, including cost recovery and cost allocation.  The settlement provides for Entergy Louisiana to recover $200 million as of March 31, 2011, and carrying costs on that amount on specified terms thereafter.  The settlement also provides for Entergy Louisiana to recover the approved project costs by securitization.  In April 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC to authorize the securitization of the investment recovery costs associated with the project and to issue a financing order by which Entergy Louisiana could accomplish such securitization.  In August 2011 the LPSC issued an order approving the settlement and also issued a financing order for the securitization.  See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the September 2011 issuance of the securitization bonds.

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery

The rates that Entergy Louisiana charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.  Entergy Louisiana is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings.  A governmental agency, the LPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Filings with the LPSC

2016 Formula Rate Plan Filing

In May 2017, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2016 calendar year operations.  The evaluation report reflected an earned return on common equity of

9.84%

.  As such, no adjustment to base formula rate plan revenue was required.  Adjustments, however, were required under the formula rate plan; the 2016 formula rate plan evaluation report showed a decrease in formula rate plan revenue of approximately

$16.9 million

, comprised of a decrease in legacy Entergy Louisiana formula rate plan revenue of

$3.5 million

, a decrease in legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana formula rate plan revenue of

$9.7 million

, and a decrease in incremental formula rate plan revenue of

$3.7 million

.  Additionally, the formula rate plan evaluation report called for a decrease of

$40.5 million

in the MISO cost recovery revenue requirement from

$46.8 million

to

$6.3 million

.  Rates reflecting these adjustments were implemented with the first billing cycle of September 2017, subject to refund.  In September 2017 the LPSC staff issued its report indicating that no changes to Entergy Louisiana’s original formula rate plan evaluation report were required but reserved for several issues, including Entergy Louisiana’s September 2017 update to its formula rate plan evaluation report.   In July 2018, Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff filed an unopposed joint report setting forth a correction to the annualization calculation, the effect of which was a net $3.5 million revenue requirement reduction and indicating that there are no outstanding issues with the 2016 formula rate plan report, the supplemental report, or the interim updates. In September 2018 the LPSC approved the unopposed joint report.

Formula Rate Plan Extension Through 2019 Test Year

In August 2017, Entergy Louisiana filed a request with the LPSC seeking to extend its formula rate plan for three years (2017-2019) with limited modifications to its terms.  In April 2018, the LPSC approved an unopposed joint motion filed by Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff that settles the matter and extends the formula rate plan for three years, providing for rates through at least August 2021.  In addition to retaining the major features of the traditional formula rate plan, some of the more substantive features of the extended formula rate plan include:

•

a mid-point reset of formula rate plan revenues to a 9.95% earned return on common equity for the 2017 test year and for the St. Charles Power Station when it enters commercial operation;

•

a 9.8% target earned return on common equity for the 2018 and 2019 test years;

•

narrowing of the common equity bandwidth to plus or minus 60 basis points around the earned return on common equity;

•

a cap on potential revenue increase of $35 million for the 2018 evaluation period, and $70 million for the cumulative 2018 and 2019 evaluation periods, on formula rate plan cost of service rate increases (the cap excludes rate changes associated with the transmission recovery mechanism described below and rate changes associated with additional capacity);

•

a framework for the flow back of certain tax benefits created by the Tax Act to customers; and

•

a transmission recovery mechanism providing for the opportunity to recover certain transmission related expenditures in excess of $100 million for projects placed in service up to one month prior to rate change outside of sharing that is designed to operate in a fashion similar to the additional capacity mechanism.

Entergy Louisiana has indicated its intent to seek an extension of its formula rate plan on terms similar to the existing terms.

2017 Formula Rate Plan Filing

In June 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2017 calendar year operations.  The 2017 test year evaluation report produced an earned return on equity of 8.16%, due in large part to revenue-neutral realignments to other recovery mechanisms.  Without these realignments, the evaluation report produces an earned return on equity of 9.88% and a resulting base rider formula rate plan revenue increase of $4.8 million.  Excluding the Tax Act credits provided for by the tax reform adjustment mechanisms, total formula rate plan revenues were further increased by a total of $98 million as a result of the evaluation report due to adjustments to the additional capacity and MISO cost recovery mechanisms of the formula rate plan, and implementation of the transmission recovery mechanism.  In August 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed a supplemental formula rate plan evaluation report to reflect changes from the 2016 test year formula rate plan proceedings, a decrease to the transmission recovery mechanism to reflect lower actual capital additions, and a decrease to evaluation period expenses to reflect the terms of a new power sales agreement.  Based on the August 2018 update, Entergy Louisiana recognized a total decrease in formula rate plan revenue of approximately $17.6 million. Results of the updated 2017 evaluation report filing were implemented with the September 2018 billing month subject to refund and review by the LPSC staff and intervenors.  In accordance with the terms of the formula rate plan, in September 2018 the LPSC staff and intervenors submitted their responses to Entergy Louisiana’s original formula rate plan evaluation report and supplemental compliance updates.  The LPSC staff asserted objections/reservations regarding 1) Entergy Louisiana’s proposed rate adjustments associated with the return of excess accumulated deferred income taxes pursuant to the Tax Act and the treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes related to reductions of rate base; 2) Entergy Louisiana’s reservation regarding treatment of a regulatory asset related to certain special orders by the LPSC; and 3) test year expenses billed from Entergy Services to Entergy Louisiana.  Intervenors also objected to Entergy Louisiana’s treatment of the regulatory asset related to certain special orders by the LPSC.  A procedural schedule has not yet been established to resolve these issues.



Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Entergy Louisiana also included in its filing a presentation of an initial proposal to combine the legacy Entergy Louisiana and legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana residential rates, which combination, if approved, would be accomplished on a revenue-neutral basis intended not to affect the rates of other customer classes.

Commercial operation at St. Charles Power Station commenced in May 2019.  In May 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed an update to its 2017 formula rate plan evaluation report to include the estimated first-year revenue requirement of $109.5 million associated with the St. Charles Power Station.  The resulting interim adjustment to rates became effective with the first billing cycle of June 2019.

2018 Formula Rate Plan Filing

In May 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2018 calendar year operations.  The 2018 test year evaluation report produced an earned return on common equity of 10.61% leading to a base rider formula rate plan revenue decrease of $8.9 million.  While base rider formula rate plan revenue will decrease as a result of this filing, overall formula rate plan revenues will increase by approximately $118.7 million.  This outcome is primarily driven by a reduction to the credits previously flowed through the tax reform adjustment mechanism and an increase in the transmission recovery mechanism, partially offset by reductions in the additional capacity mechanism revenue requirements and extraordinary cost items.  The filing is subject to review by the LPSC.  Resulting rates were implemented in September 2019, subject to refund.

Entergy Louisiana also included in its filing a presentation of an initial proposal to combine the legacy Entergy Louisiana and legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana residential rates, which combination, if approved, would be accomplished on a revenue-neutral basis intended not to affect the rates of other customer classes.  Entergy Louisiana contemplates that any combination of residential rates resulting from this request would be implemented with the results of the 2019 test year formula rate plan filing.

Several parties intervened in the proceeding and the LPSC staff filed its report of objections/reservations in accordance with the applicable provisions of the formula rate plan.  In its report the LPSC staff re-urged reservations with respect to the outstanding issues from the 2017 test year formula rate plan filing and disputed the inclusion of certain affiliate costs for test years 2017 and 2018.  The LPSC staff objected to Entergy Louisiana’s proposal to combine residential rates but proposed the setting of a status conference to establish a procedural schedule to more fully address the issue.  The LPSC staff also reserved its right to object to the treatment of the sale of Willow Glen reflected in the evaluation report and to the August 2019 compliance update, which was made primarily to update the capital additions reflected in the formula rate plan’s transmission recovery mechanism, based on limited time to review it.  Additionally, since the completion of certain transmission projects, the LPSC staff has issued supplemental data requests addressing the prudence of Entergy Louisiana’s expenditures in connection with those projects.  Entergy Louisiana is in the process of responding to those requests.

Investigation of Costs Billed by Entergy Services

In November 2018 the LPSC issued a notice of proceeding initiating an investigation into costs incurred by Entergy Services that are included in the retail rates of Entergy Louisiana.  As stated in the notice of proceeding, the LPSC observed an increase in capital construction-related costs incurred by Entergy Services.  Discovery was issued and included efforts to seek highly detailed information on a broad range of matters unrelated to the scope of the audit.  There has been no further activity in the investigation since May 2019.

Waterford 3 Replacement Steam Generator Project

Following the completion of the Waterford 3 replacement steam generator project, the LPSC undertook a prudence review in connection with a filing made by Entergy Louisiana in April 2013 with regard to the following aspects of the replacement project: 1) project management; 2) cost controls; 3) success in achieving stated objectives; 4) the costs of the replacement project; and 5) the outage length and replacement power costs.  In July 2014 the LPSC



Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

staff filed testimony recommending potential project and replacement power cost disallowances of up to

$71 million

, citing a need for further explanation or documentation from Entergy Louisiana.  An intervenor filed testimony recommending disallowance of

$141 million

of incremental project costs, claiming the steam generator fabricator was imprudent.   Entergy Louisiana provided further documentation and explanation requested by the LPSC staff.  An evidentiary hearing was held in December 2014.  Entergy Louisiana believed that the replacement steam generator costs were prudently incurred and applicable legal principles supported their recovery in rates.  Nevertheless, Entergy Louisiana recorded a write-off of

$16 million

of Waterford 3’s plant balance in December 2014 because of the uncertainty at the time associated with the resolution of the prudence review.  In December 2015 the ALJ issued a proposed recommendation, which was subsequently finalized, concluding that Entergy Louisiana prudently managed the Waterford 3 replacement steam generator project, including the selection, use, and oversight of contractors, and could not reasonably have anticipated the damage to the steam generators.  Nevertheless, the ALJ concluded that Entergy Louisiana was liable for the conduct of its contractor and subcontractor and, therefore, recommended a disallowance of

$67 million

in capital costs.  Additionally, the ALJ concluded that Entergy Louisiana did not sufficiently justify the incurrence of

$2 million

in replacement power costs during the replacement outage.  Although the ALJ’s recommendation had not yet been considered by the LPSC, after considering the progress of the proceeding in light of the ALJ recommendation, Entergy Louisiana recorded in the fourth quarter 2015 approximately

$77 million

in charges, including a

$45 million

asset write-off and a

$32 million

regulatory charge, to reflect that a portion of the assets associated with the Waterford 3 replacement steam generator project was no longer probable of recovery.  Entergy Louisiana maintained that the ALJ’s recommendation contained significant factual and legal errors.

In October 2016 the parties reached a settlement in this matter.  The settlement was approved by the LPSC in December 2016.  The settlement effectively provided for an agreed-upon disallowance of $67 million of plant, which had been previously written off by Entergy Louisiana, as discussed above.  The refund to customers of approximately

$71 million

as a result of the settlement approved by the LPSC was made to customers in January 2017.  Of the $71 million of refunds,

$68 million

was credited to customers through Entergy Louisiana’s formula rate plan, outside of sharing, and

$3 million

through its fuel adjustment clause.  Entergy Louisiana had previously recorded a provision of

$48 million

for this refund.  The previously-recorded provision included the cumulative revenues recorded through December 2016 related to the $67 million of disallowed plant.  An additional regulatory charge of

$23 million

was recorded in fourth quarter 2016 to reflect the effects of the settlement.  The settlement also provided that Entergy Louisiana could retain the value associated with potential service credits agreed to by the project contractor, to the extent they are realized in the future.  Following a review by the parties, an unopposed joint report of proceedings was filed by the LPSC staff and Entergy Louisiana in May 2017 and the LPSC accepted the joint report of proceedings resolving the matter.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)

In November 2016, Entergy Louisiana filed an application seeking a finding from the LPSC that Entergy Louisiana’s deployment of advanced electric and gas metering infrastructure is in the public interest.  Entergy Louisiana proposed to deploy advanced meters that enable two-way data communication; design and build a secure and reliable network to support such communications; and implement support systems.  AMI is intended to serve as the foundation of Entergy Louisiana’s modernized power grid.  The filing included an estimate of implementation costs for AMI of

$330 million

and identified a number of quantified and unquantified benefits. Entergy Louisiana proposed a 15-year useful life for the new advanced meters, the three-year deployment of which began in 2019.  Deployment of the communications network began in 2018.  Entergy Louisiana proposed to recover the cost of AMI through the implementation of a customer charge, net of certain benefits, phased in over the period 2019 through 2022.  The parties reached an uncontested stipulation permitting implementation of Entergy Louisiana’s proposed AMI system, with modifications to the proposed customer charge.  In July 2017 the LPSC approved the stipulation.  Entergy Louisiana will recover the undepreciated balance of its existing meters through a regulatory asset to be amortized at current depreciation rates, as approved by the LPSC.

2016 Rate Stabilization Plan Filing

In January 2017, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2016.  The filing of the evaluation report for test year 2016 reflected an earned return on common equity of

6.37%

.  In April 2017 the LPSC approved a joint report of proceedings and Entergy Louisiana submitted a revised evaluation report reflecting a

$1.2 million

annual increase in revenue with rates implemented with the first billing cycle of May 2017.

2017 Rate Stabilization Plan Filing

In January 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2017.  The filing of the evaluation report for the test year 2017 reflected an earned return on common equity of 9.06%.  This earned return is below the earnings sharing band of the rate stabilization plan and results in a rate increase of $0.1 million.  Due to the enactment in late-December 2017 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Entergy Louisiana did not have adequate time to reflect the effects of this tax legislation in the rate stabilization plan. In April 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed a supplemental evaluation report for the test year ended September 2017, reflecting the effects of the Tax Act, including a proposal to use the unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to offset approximately $1.4 million of storm restoration deferred operation and maintenance costs incurred by Entergy Louisiana in connection with the August 2016 flooding disaster in its gas service area.  The supplemental filing reflects an earned return on common equity of 10.79%.  As-filed rates from the supplemental filing were implemented, subject to refund, with customers receiving a cost reduction of approximately $0.7 million effective with bills rendered on and after the first billing cycle of May 2018, as well as a $0.2 million reduction in the gas infrastructure rider effective with bills rendered on and after the first billing cycle of July 2018.  In October 2019 the LPSC staff issued its report finding that Entergy Louisiana’s filing complied with the terms of the rate stabilization plan but recommending an additional refund of $0.7 million related to the Tax Act.  A procedural schedule has not been established.

2018 Rate Stabilization Plan Filing

In January 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2018. The filing of the evaluation report for the test year 2018 reflected an earned return on common equity of

2.69%

.  This earned return is below the earning sharing band of the gas rate stabilization plan and results in a rate increase of

$2.8 million

.  Entergy Louisiana made a compliance filing in April 2019 and rates were implemented during the first billing cycle of May 2019, subject to refund and final LPSC review.  The proceeding is currently in its discovery phase.

Gas Rate Stabilization Plan Extension Request

In August 2019, Entergy Louisiana submitted an application to the LPSC seeking extension of the gas rate stabilization plan for the 2019-2021 test years on the same terms as those approved for the 2018 test year.  The LPSC established a procedural schedule to address this request with a hearing scheduled in May 2020.  Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff recently submitted a joint stipulation that recommends approval of the requested extension with certain modifications to the current terms, including a

9.8%

evaluation period cost rate for common equity and provisions for the return of the excess accumulated deferred income tax to customers on a dollar for dollar basis in a manner consistent with IRS normalization rules.  The LPSC approved the joint stipulation in January 2020.

2019 Rate Stabilization Plan Filing

In January 2020, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2019.  The filing of the evaluation report for the test year 2019 reflected an earned return on common equity of 10.78%.  This earned return exceeds the earning sharing band of the gas rate stabilization plan leading to a rate reduction of approximately $256 thousand.

Fuel and purchased power recovery

Entergy Louisiana recovers electric fuel and purchased power costs for the billing month based upon the level of such costs incurred

two months

prior to the billing month.  Entergy Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustments include estimates for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

In July 2014 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of the fuel adjustment clause filings by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, whose business was combined with Entergy Louisiana in 2015.  The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause for the period from 2010 through 2013.  In January 2019, the LPSC staff consultant issued its audit report. In its report, the LPSC staff consultant recommended that Entergy Louisiana refund approximately $900,000, plus interest, to customers based upon the imputation of a claim of vendor fault in servicing its nuclear plant.  Entergy Louisiana recorded a provision in first quarter 2019 for the potential outcome of the audit.  In August 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed direct testimony challenging the basis for the LPSC staff’s recommended disallowance and providing an alternative calculation of replacement power costs should it be determined that a disallowance is appropriate.  Entergy Louisiana’s calculation would require no refund to customers.

The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed by Entergy Louisiana through its fuel adjustment clause for the period from 2010 through 2013.  In January 2019, the LPSC staff consultant issued its audit report. In its report, the LPSC staff consultant recommended that Entergy Louisiana refund approximately $7.3 million, plus interest, to customers based upon the imputation of a claim of vendor fault in servicing its nuclear plant.  Entergy Louisiana recorded a provision in the first quarter 2019 for the potential outcome of the audit.  In August 2019, Entergy Louisiana filed direct testimony challenging the basis for the LPSC staff’s recommended disallowance and providing an alternative calculation of replacement power costs should it be determined that a disallowance is appropriate.  Entergy Louisiana’s calculation would require a refund to customers of approximately $4.3 million, plus interest, as compared to the LPSC staff’s recommendation of $7.3 million, plus interest.  Responsive testimony was filed by the LPSC staff and intervenors in September 2019; all parties either agreed with or did not oppose Entergy Louisiana’s alternative calculation of replacement power costs.

In November 2019 the pending LPSC proceedings for the 2010-2013 Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana audits were consolidated to facilitate a settlement of both fuel audits.  In December 2019 an unopposed settlement was reached that requires a refund to legacy Entergy Louisiana customers of approximately $2.3 million, including interest, and no refund to legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana customers.  The LPSC approved the settlement in January 2020.

In June 2016 the LPSC issued notice of audits of Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause filings and purchased gas adjustment clause filings for the period 2014 through 2015.  In recognition of the business combination that occurred in 2015, the audit notice was issued to Entergy Louisiana and will also include a review of charges to legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana customers prior to the business combination.  The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause for the period from 2014 through 2015 and charges flowed through Entergy Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustment clause for the period from 2012 through 2015.  Discovery commenced in March 2017.  No report of audit has been issued.

Discovery commenced in September 2018.  No report of audit has been issued.

Net Metering Rulemaking

In September 2019 the LPSC issued an order modifying its rules regarding net metering installations.   Among other things, the rule provides for 2-channel billing for net metering with excess energy put to the grid being compensated at the utility’s avoided cost.  However, the rule does provide that net meter installations in place as of December 31, 2019 will be subject to 1:1 net metering with excess energy put to the grid being compensated at the full retail rate for a period of 15 years (through December 31, 2034), after which those installations will be subject to 2-channel billing.  The rule also eliminates the existing limit on the cumulative number of net meter installations.

Industrial and Commercial Customers

Entergy Louisiana’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs.  In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Louisiana’s industrial customer base.  Entergy Louisiana responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles.  Entergy Louisiana actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers.

” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of federal regulation.

Nuclear Matters

Entergy Louisiana owns and, through an affiliate, operates the River Bend and Waterford 3 nuclear power plants.  Entergy Louisiana is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating nuclear plants.  These include risks related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements, both for capital investments and operational needs, to position Entergy’s nuclear fleet to meet its operational goals, including the financial requirements to address emerging issues like stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the plant systems and the Fukushima event; regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license renewal and amendments, and decommissioning; the performance and capacity factors of these nuclear plants; the availability of interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets and earnings to complete decommissioning of each site when required; and limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events such as a nuclear accident.  In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of River Bend or Waterford 3, Entergy Louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.  Waterford 3’s operating license expires in 2044 and River Bend’s operating license expires in 2045.

Environmental Risks

Entergy Louisiana’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes that Entergy Louisiana is in substantial compliance with environmental



Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in “

Regulation of Entergy’s Business

-

Environmental Regulation

” in Part I, Item 1.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of Entergy Louisiana’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Louisiana’s financial position or results of operations.

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

See “

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

” in the “

Critical Accounting Estimates

” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.

In the first quarter 2018, Entergy Louisiana recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for River Bend as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study.  The revised estimate resulted in an $85.4 million increase in its decommissioning cost liability, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost asset that will be depreciated over the remaining life of the unit.

In the second quarter 2019, Entergy Louisiana recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for Waterford 3 as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study.  The revised estimate resulted in a $147.5 million increase in its decommissioning cost liability, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost asset that will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of the unit.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy Louisiana’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.   See the “

Critical Accounting Estimates

” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Cost Sensitivity

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.

Costs and Employer Contributions

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Louisiana in 2019 was $48.6 million.  Entergy Louisiana anticipates 2020 qualified pension cost to be $63.4 million.  Entergy Louisiana contributed $65 million to its qualified pension plans in 2019 and estimates pension contributions will be approximately $38.8 million in 2020, although the 2020 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2020 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2020.

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Louisiana in 2019 were $7.3 million.  Entergy Louisiana expects 2020 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs of approximately $8.7 million.  Entergy Louisiana contributed $14.3 million to its other postretirement plans in 2019 and estimates that 2020 contributions will be approximately $18.5 million.

ENTERGY MISSISSIPPI, LLC

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Results of Operations

2019 Compared to 2018

Net Income

Net income decreased $6.2 million primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expenses, lower volume/weather, and a higher effective income tax rate, partially offset by higher retail electric price.

Operating Revenues

Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2019 to 2018.

Entergy Mississippi’s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income.  “Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income” includes the revenue variance associated with these items.

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease of 455 GWh, or 3%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales and a decrease in industrial usage.  The decrease in industrial usage is primarily due to decreased small industrial sales.

The return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers is due to the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes through customer bill credits over a three-month period from July 2018 through September 2018 per an agreement approved by the MPSC in June 2018 resulting from the stipulation related to the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  There was no effect on net income as the reduction in operating revenues was offset by a reduction in income tax expense.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in formula rate plan rates effective with the first billing cycle of July 2019 and an accrual in the fourth quarter 2019 for the interim capacity rate adjustment to the formula rate plan to recover non-fuel related costs associated with the acquisition of the Choctaw Generating Station, each as approved by the MPSC.  Entergy Mississippi began billing the interim capacity rate adjustment in January 2020.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan filing and the interim capacity rate adjustment.

an increase of $4.7 million

in spending on initiatives to explore new customer products and services; and

•

an increase of $4.6 million in information technology costs primarily due to higher costs related to applications and infrastructure support, enhanced cyber security, and upgrades and maintenance.

The increase was partially offset by a $5.8 million loss in 2018 on the sale of fuel oil inventory per an agreement approved by the MPSC in June 2018 resulting from the stipulation related to the effects of the Tax Act.  There is no effect on net income as the loss on the sale of fuel oil inventory is offset by a reduction in income tax expense.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily as a result of higher depreciation rates, as approved by the MPSC, and additions to plant in service.

Other regulatory charges include a regulatory charge recorded in second quarter 2018 to reflect the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes per an agreement approved by the MPSC in June 2018 that resulted in a reduction in net utility plant of $127.2 million.  There was no effect on net income as the regulatory charge was offset by a reduction in income tax expense.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Interest expense increased primarily due to issuances of $300 million in June 2019 and $135 million in November 2019, of 3.85% Series mortgage bonds and the issuance of $55 million of 4.52% Series mortgage bonds in December 2018, partially offset by the repayment, at maturity, of $150 million of 6.64% Series mortgage bonds in July 2019.  See Note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt.

The effective income tax rates were

20.5%

for 2019 and (41,237%) for 2018.   The difference in the effective income tax rate of (41,237%) versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2018 was primarily due to the flow through of excess accumulated deferred income taxes.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates.

Cash Flow

Cash flows for the years ended December 31,


,


, and


were as follows:

2019 Compared to 2018

Operating Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $78.4 million in 2019 primarily due to:

•

the timing of collection of receivables from customers;

•

the receipt of $36.2 million from Entergy Arkansas as a result of a compliance filing made in response to the FERC’s October 2018 order in the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales proceeding.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the opportunity sales proceeding; and

•

$26.2 million in proceeds from the sale of fuel oil inventory in 2018.

The decrease was partially offset by the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs and the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers in 2018.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Investing Activities

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $314.2 million in 2019 primarily due to:

•

the purchase of the Choctaw Generating Station in October 2019 for approximately $305 million.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of the Choctaw Generating Station purchase;

•

an increase of $34.9 million primarily due to investment in the infrastructure of Entergy Mississippi’s distribution system, including increased spending on advanced metering infrastructure; and

•

an increase of $15.6 million in storm spending in 2019.

The increase was partially offset by money pool activity.

Increases in Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool increased by $3.3 million in 2019 compared to increasing by $39.7 million in 2018.  The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

Financing Activities

Net cash flow provided by financing activities increased $376.5 million in 2019 primarily due to:

•

the issuance of $435 million of 3.85% Series mortgage bonds in 2019 compared to the issuance of $55 million of 4.52% Series mortgage bonds 2018;

•

a capital contribution of $130 million in October 2019 in anticipation of  the purchase of the Choctaw Generating Station in October 2019; and

•

the redemption of $20 million of preferred stock in 2018 in connection with the internal restructuring.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the internal restructuring and Note 6 to the financial statements for details of preferred stock activity.

The increase was partially offset by the repayment, at maturity, of $150 million of 6.64% Series mortgage bonds in July 2019.

Capital Structure

Entergy Mississippi’s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table.

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents.  Debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion.  Capital consists of debt and equity.  Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents.  Entergy Mississippi uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Mississippi’s financial condition.  Entergy Mississippi uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Mississippi’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Mississippi’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

Entergy Mississippi seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings.  To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a distribution, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure.  To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, Entergy Mississippi may issue incremental debt or reduce distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure.  In addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing distributions, Entergy Mississippi may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure.

Uses of Capital

Entergy Mississippi requires capital resources for:

•

construction and other capital investments;

•

debt maturities or retirements;

•

working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and

•

distributions and interest payments.

Following are the amounts of Entergy Mississippi’s planned construction and other capital investments.

Following are the amounts of Entergy Mississippi’s existing debt obligations and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments) and other purchase obligations.

(a)

Includes estimated interest payments.  Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.

(b)

Lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements.

(c)

Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services.  For Entergy Mississippi, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Mississippi currently expects to contribute approximately $7.8 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $130 thousand to other postretirement health care and life insurance plans in 2020, although the 2020 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2020 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2020.  See “

Critical Accounting Estimates

– Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

Also, in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Mississippi has $59.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Mississippi includes amounts associated with specific investments such as the Sunflower Solar Facility;



Entergy Mississippi, LLC

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable economic growth; distribution spending to enhance reliability and improve service to customers, including advanced meters and related investments; resource planning, including potential generation projects; system improvements; software and security; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital.

As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, Entergy Mississippi pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly.

Sunflower Solar Facility

In November 2018, Entergy Mississippi announced that it signed an agreement for the purchase of an approximately 100 MW to-be-constructed solar photovoltaic facility that will be sited on approximately 1,000 acres in Sunflower County, Mississippi.  The estimated base purchase price is approximately $138.4 million.  The estimated total investment, including the base purchase price and other related costs, for Entergy Mississippi to acquire the Sunflower Solar Facility is approximately $153.2 million.  The purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including full cost recovery, from applicable federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies.  The project will be built by Sunflower County Solar Project, LLC, a sub-subsidiary of Recurrent Energy, LLC.  Entergy Mississippi will purchase the facility upon mechanical completion and after the other purchase contingencies have been met.  In December 2018, Entergy Mississippi filed a joint petition with Sunflower Solar Project at the MPSC for Sunflower Solar Project to construct and for Entergy Mississippi to acquire and thereafter own, operate, improve, and maintain the solar facility.  Entergy Mississippi proposed revisions to its formula rate plan that would provide for a mechanism, the interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism, in the formula rate plan to recover the non-fuel related costs of additional owned capacity acquired by Entergy Mississippi, including the annual ownership costs of the Sunflower Solar Facility.  In December 2019 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi’s proposed revisions to its formula rate plan to provide for an interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism.  The MPSC must approve recovery through the interim capacity rate adjustment for each new resource.  In August 2019 consultants retained by the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed a report expressing concerns regarding the project economics and recommended that, should the MPSC wish to approve the project, Entergy Mississippi should be required to guarantee the energy output of the unit.  Entergy Mississippi and the Staff are engaged in settlement discussions to address these concerns.  A hearing before the MPSC is targeted to occur by the second quarter of 2020.  Closing is expected to occur by the end of 2021.

Sources of Capital

Entergy Mississippi’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:

•

internally generated funds;

•

cash on hand;

•

debt or preferred membership interest issuances;

•

capital contributions; and

•

bank financing under new or existing facilities.

Entergy Mississippi may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest rates are favorable.

All debt and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy Mississippi require prior regulatory approval.  Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indenture and other agreements.  Entergy Mississippi has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.



Entergy Mississippi, LLC

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Entergy Mississippi’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years.

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

Entergy Mississippi has three separate credit facilities in the aggregate amount of $82.5 million scheduled to expire in May 2020.  No borrowings were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2019.  In addition, Entergy Mississippi is a party to an uncommitted letter of credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to MISO.  As of December 31, 2019, $1.8 million of letters of credit were outstanding under Entergy Mississippi’s uncommitted letter of credit facility.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facilities.

Entergy Mississippi obtained authorization from the FERC through November 2020 for short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $175 million at any time outstanding and long-term borrowings and security issuances.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Mississippi’s short-term borrowing limits.

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery

The rates that Entergy Mississippi charges for electricity significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.  Entergy Mississippi is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings.  A governmental agency, the MPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Formula Rate Plan Filings

In March 2017, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2017 test year filing and 2016 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi’s earned return for the historical 2016 calendar year and projected earned return for the 2017 calendar year to be within the formula rate plan bandwidth, resulting in no change in rates.  In June 2017, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a stipulation that confirmed that Entergy Mississippi’s earned returns for both the 2016 look-back filing and 2017 test year were within the respective formula rate plan bandwidths.  In June 2017 the MPSC approved the stipulation, which resulted in no change in rates.

In March 2018, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2018 test year filing and 2017 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi’s earned return for the historical 2017 calendar year and projected earned return for the 2018 calendar year, in large part as a result of the lower federal corporate income tax rate effective in 2018, to be within the formula rate plan bandwidth, resulting in no change in rates.  In June 2018, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a stipulation that confirmed that Entergy Mississippi’s earned returns for both the 2017 look-back filing and 2018 test year were within the respective formula rate plan bandwidths.  In June 2018 the MPSC approved the stipulation, which resulted in no change in rates.

In October 2018, Entergy Mississippi proposed revisions to its formula rate plan that would provide for a mechanism in the formula rate plan, the interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism, to recover the non-fuel related costs of additional owned capacity acquired by Entergy Mississippi, including the non-fuel annual ownership costs of the Choctaw Generating Station, as well as to allow similar cost recovery treatment for other future capacity acquisitions, such as the Sunflower Solar Facility, that are approved by the MPSC.  In December 2019 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi’s proposed revisions to its formula rate plan to provide for an interim capacity rate adjustment mechanism, which Entergy Mississippi began billing in January 2020.  The MPSC must approve recovery through the interim

capacity rate adjustment for each new resource.  In addition, the MPSC approved revisions to the formula rate plan which allows Entergy Mississippi to begin billing rate adjustments effective April 1 of the filing year on a temporary basis subject to refund or credit to customers, subject to final MPSC order.  The MPSC also authorized Entergy Mississippi to remove vegetation management costs from the formula rate plan and recover these costs through the establishment of a vegetation management rider.

In March 2019, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2019 test year filing and 2018 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi’s earned return for the historical 2018 calendar year to be above the formula rate plan bandwidth and projected earned return for the 2019 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth.  The 2019 test year filing shows a

$36.8 million

rate increase is necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi’s earned return on common equity to the specified point of adjustment of

6.94%

return on rate base, within the formula rate plan bandwidth.  The 2018 look-back filing compares actual 2018 results to the approved benchmark return on rate base and shows a

$10.1 million

interim decrease in formula rate plan revenues is necessary.  In the fourth quarter 2018, Entergy Mississippi recorded a provision of

$9.3 million

that reflected the estimate of the difference between the 2018 expected earned rate of return on rate base and an established performance-adjusted benchmark rate of return under the formula rate plan performance-adjusted bandwidth mechanism.  In the first quarter 2019, Entergy Mississippi recorded a

$0.8 million

increase in the provision to reflect the amount shown in the look-back filing.  In June 2019, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a joint stipulation that confirmed that the 2019 test year filing showed that a

$32.8 million

rate increase is necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi’s earned return on common equity to the specified point of adjustment of

6.93%

return on rate base, within the formula rate plan bandwidth.  Additionally, pursuant to the joint stipulation, Entergy Mississippi’s 2018 look-back filing reflected an earned return on rate base of

7.81%

in calendar year 2018 which is above the look-back benchmark return on rate base of

7.13%

, resulting in an $11 million decrease in formula rate plan revenues on an interim basis through May 2020.  In the second quarter 2019, Entergy Mississippi recorded an additional

$0.9 million

increase in the provision to reflect the

$11 million

shown in the look-back filing.  In June 2019 the MPSC approved the joint stipulation with rates effective for the first billing cycle of July 2019.

Internal Restructuring

In March 2018, Entergy Mississippi filed an application with the MPSC seeking authorization to undertake a restructuring that would result in the transfer of substantially all of the assets and operations of Entergy Mississippi to a new entity, which would ultimately be held by an existing Entergy subsidiary holding company.  In September 2018, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into and filed a joint stipulation regarding the restructuring filing.  In September 2018 the MPSC issued an order accepting the stipulation in its entirety and approving the restructuring and credits of

$27 million

to retail customers over six years, consisting of annual payments of

$4.5 million

for the years 2019-2024.  Entergy Mississippi also received the required FERC approval.

In November 2018, Entergy Mississippi undertook a multi-step restructuring, including the following:

•

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. redeemed its outstanding preferred stock, at the aggregate redemption price of approximately

$21.2 million

.

•

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. converted from a Mississippi corporation to a Texas corporation.

•

Under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Entergy Mississippi, Inc. allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy Mississippi Power and Light, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Entergy Mississippi Power and Light), and Entergy Mississippi Power and Light assumed substantially all of the liabilities of Entergy Mississippi, Inc., in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC.  Entergy Mississippi, Inc. remained in existence and held the membership interests in Entergy Mississippi Power and Light.

•

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. contributed the membership interests in Entergy Mississippi Power and Light to an affiliate (Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and subsidiary of Entergy Corporation).  As a result of the contribution, Entergy Mississippi Power and Light is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC.



Entergy Mississippi, LLC

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

In December 2018, Entergy Mississippi, Inc. changed its name to Entergy Utility Enterprises, Inc., and Entergy Mississippi Power and Light then changed its name to Entergy Mississippi, LLC.  Entergy Mississippi, LLC holds substantially all of the assets, and assumed substantially all of the liabilities, of Entergy Mississippi, Inc.  The restructuring was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control.

In December 2018, Entergy Mississippi filed its notice of intent to implement the restructuring credit rider to allow Entergy Mississippi to return credits of

$27 million

to retail customers over six years.  In January 2019 the MPSC approved the proposed restructuring credit adjustment factor, which is effective for bills rendered beginning February 2019.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)

In November 2016, Entergy Mississippi filed an application seeking an order from the MPSC granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity and finding that Entergy Mississippi’s deployment of AMI is in the public interest.  Entergy Mississippi proposed to replace existing meters with advanced meters that enable two-way data communication; to design and build a secure and reliable network to support such communications; and to implement support systems.  AMI is intended to serve as the foundation of Entergy Mississippi’s modernized power grid.  The filing included an estimate of implementation costs for AMI of

$132 million

and identified a number of quantified and unquantified benefits.  Entergy Mississippi proposed a 15-year depreciable life for the new advanced meters, the three-year deployment of which began in 2019.  Deployment of the communications network began in 2018.  Entergy Mississippi proposed to include the AMI deployment costs and the quantified benefits in existing rate mechanisms, primarily through future formula rate plan filings and/or future energy cost recovery rider schedule re-determinations, as applicable.  In May 2017 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi entered into and filed a joint stipulation supporting Entergy Mississippi’s filing, and the MPSC issued an order approving the filing without material changes, finding that Entergy Mississippi’s deployment of AMI is in the public interest and granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity.  The MPSC order also confirmed that Entergy Mississippi shall continue to include in rate base the remaining book value of existing meters that will be retired as part of the AMI deployment and also to depreciate those assets using current depreciation rates.  In June 2018, as part of the order approving the joint stipulation between the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi addressing Entergy Mississippi’s 2018 formula rate plan evaluation report and the ratemaking effects of the Tax Act, the MPSC approved the acceleration of the recovery of substantially all of Entergy Mississippi’s existing customer meters in anticipation of AMI deployment.

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery

Entergy Mississippi’s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider that is adjusted annually to reflect accumulated over- or under-recoveries.  Entergy Mississippi’s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC.

In January 2017 the MPSC certified to the Mississippi Legislature the audit reports of its independent auditors for the fuel year ending September 30, 2016.  In November 2017 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff separately engaged a consultant to review the September 2016 outage at the Grand Gulf Nuclear Station and to review ongoing operations at Grand Gulf.  This engagement continues, and subsequently, was expanded to include all outages at Grand Gulf that occurred through 2019.

In November 2017, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider.  The calculation of the annual factor included an under-recovery of approximately

$61.5 million

as of September 30, 2017.  In January 2018 the MPSC approved the proposed energy cost factors effective for February 2018 bills.



Entergy Mississippi, LLC

In November 2018, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider.  The calculation of the annual factor included an under-recovery of approximately

$57 million

as of September 30, 2018.  In January 2019 the MPSC approved the proposed energy cost factor effective for February 2019 bills.

In November 2019, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider.  The calculation of the annual factor included an over-recovery of approximately

$39.6 million

as of September 30, 2019.  In January 2020 the MPSC approved the proposed energy cost factor effective for February 2020 bills.

Mississippi Attorney General Complaint

The Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in state court in December 2008 against Entergy Corporation, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Services, and Entergy Power alleging, among other things, violations of Mississippi statutes, fraud, and breach of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting an accounting and restitution.  The complaint is wide ranging and relates to tariffs and procedures under which Entergy Mississippi purchases power not generated in Mississippi to meet electricity demand.  Entergy believes the complaint is unfounded.  In December 2008 the defendant Entergy companies removed the Attorney General’s lawsuit to U.S. District Court in Jackson, Mississippi.

In June 2010 the MPSC authorized the deferral of certain legal expenses associated with this litigation until it is resolved.  As of December 31, 2019, Entergy Mississippi has a regulatory asset of

$29.5 million

for these deferred legal expenses.  In April 2019 the District Court remanded the Attorney General’s lawsuit to the Hinds County Chancery Court.  A hearing on procedural and dispositive motions was held in August 2019.  In December 2019 the Hinds County Chancery Court issued its ruling granting the motion for summary judgment filed by the Entergy defendants.  The Chancery Court found it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that the claims fall under the purview of the FERC.  In February 2020 the Chancery Court entered a final order dismissing all claims.  The order was approved by counsel for the Attorney General, and dismisses with prejudice all claims and matters in dispute and states that the plaintiff will not seek an appeal or further relief and that all matters in dispute have been resolved.

Storm Cost Recovery Filings with Retail Regulators

Entergy Mississippi has approval from the MPSC to collect a storm damage provision of

$1.75 million

per month.  If Entergy Mississippi’s accumulated storm damage provision balance exceeds

$15 million

, the collection of the storm damage provision ceases until such time that the accumulated storm damage provision becomes less than

$10 million

.  As of July 31, 2017, the balance in Entergy Mississippi’s accumulated storm damage provision was less than

$10 million

, therefore Entergy Mississippi resumed billing the monthly storm damage provision effective with September 2017 bills.  As of June 30, 2018, Entergy Mississippi’s storm damage provision balance exceeded

$15 million

.  Accordingly, the storm damage provision was reset to

zero

beginning with August 2018 bills.  As of May 31, 2019, Entergy Mississippi’s storm damage provision balance was less than $10 million.  Accordingly, Entergy Mississippi resumed billing the monthly storm damage provision effective with July 2019 bills.

Environmental Risks

Entergy Mississippi’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes that Entergy Mississippi is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in “

Regulation of Entergy’s Business

” in Part I, Item 1.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of Entergy Mississippi’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of Entergy Mississippi’s financial position or results of operations.

S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Results of Operations

2019 Compared to 2018

Net Income

Net income decreased $0.5 million primarily due to lower retail electric price and a higher effective income tax rate, substantially offset by higher other income and lower other operation and maintenance expenses.

Operating Revenues

Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2019 to 2018.

Entergy New Orleans’s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income.  “Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income” includes the revenue variance associated with these items.

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a provision for rate refund recorded in fourth quarter 2019 as a result of the 2018 combined rate case resolution approved by the City Council.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case resolution.

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in usage during the unbilled sales period.

The return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers variance is due to a decrease in the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes through the fuel adjustment clause.  In 2019, $2.1 million was returned to customers as compared to $12 million in 2018.  There is no effect on net income as the reduction in operating revenues in each period is offset by a reduction in income tax expense.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Other Income Statement Variances

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:

•

a decrease of $9.2 million as a result of the deferral in 2019 of 2018 costs related to the rate case and a system conversion for Algiers customers as a result of the 2018 combined rate case resolution approved by the City



Entergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Council.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case resolution; and

•

a decrease of $2.9 million in distribution expenses primarily due to lower contract labor costs.

The decrease was partially offset by:

•

an increase of $2.9 million in spending on initiatives to explore new customer products and services;

•

an increase of $2.8 million in information technology costs primarily due to higher software maintenance costs and higher contract costs;

•

an increase of $2 million in customer service costs primarily due to higher labor costs, including contract labor; and

•

an increase of $1.8 million in energy efficiency costs.

Other income increased primarily due to:

•

an increase in allowance for equity funds used during construction resulting from higher construction work in progress in 2019, including the New Orleans Power Station project; and

•

the accrual in fourth quarter 2018 of a $5 million settlement offer in the New Orleans Power Station show cause proceeding.  See “

” below for discussion of the New Orleans Power Station proceedings.

The effective income tax rates were 0.4% for 2019 and (4.8%) for 2018.  The differences in the effective income tax rates versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates.

Cash Flow

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows:

2019 Compared to 2018

Operating Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $56.2 million in 2019 primarily due to a decrease of $34.5 million in 2019 of income tax refunds and the timing of collection of receivables from customers.  Entergy New Orleans had income tax refunds in 2019 and 2018 in accordance with an intercompany income tax allocation agreement.  The income tax refunds resulted from the utilization of Entergy New Orleans’s net operating loss.

Investing Activities

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $3.3 million in 2019 primarily due to money pool activity.  The decrease was substantially offset by:

•

an increase of $15.6 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to a higher scope of work performed in 2019 as compared to 2018, including investment in Entergy New Orleans’s system reliability and infrastructure; and

•

an increase of $10.7 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to investment in the reliability and infrastructure of Entergy New Orleans’s distribution system, including increased spending on advanced metering infrastructure.

Decreases in Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $16.8 million in 2019 compared to increasing by $9.3 million in 2018.  The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

Financing Activities

Net cash flow provided by financing activities increased $52.3 million primarily due to:

•

proceeds from a $70 million 3.0% unsecured term loan due May 2022 in December 2019;

•

$23.8 million in common equity distributions in 2018.  There were no common equity distributions made in 2019 in anticipation of planned capital investments; and



Entergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

•

net borrowings of $20 million in 2019 on Entergy New Orleans’s credit facility.

The increase was partially offset by the issuance of $60 million of 4.51% Series mortgage bonds in September 2018.

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt.

Capital Structure

Entergy New Orleans’s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table.  The increase in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2019.

(a) Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy New Orleans.

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents.  Debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion, and the long-term payable due to an associated company. Capital consists of debt and equity.  Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy New Orleans uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy New Orleans’s financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy New Orleans, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial statements.  Entergy New Orleans also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy New Orleans’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy New Orleans’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

Entergy New Orleans seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings.  To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a distribution, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure.  To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, Entergy New Orleans may issue incremental debt or reduce distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure.  In addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing distributions, Entergy New Orleans may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Uses of Capital

Entergy New Orleans requires capital resources for:

•

construction and other capital investments;

•

working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs;

•

debt maturities or retirements; and

•

distribution and interest payments.

Following are the amounts of Entergy New Orleans’s planned construction and other capital investments.

Following are the amounts of Entergy New Orleans’s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments) and other purchase obligations.

(a)

Includes estimated interest payments.  Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.

(b)

Lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements.

(c)

Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services.  For Entergy New Orleans, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy New Orleans currently expects to contribute approximately $3.2 million to its qualified pension plan and approximately $162 thousand to other postretirement health care and life insurance plans in 2020, although the 2020 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2020 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2020.  See “

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy New Orleans has $271.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy New Orleans includes specific investments such as the New Orleans Power Station and New Orleans Solar

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Station; transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable economic growth; distribution spending to enhance reliability and improve service to customers, including advanced meters and related investments; system improvements; software and security; and other investments.  Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital.  Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements.

As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, Entergy New Orleans pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly.

New Orleans Power Station

In March 2018 the City Council adopted a resolution approving construction of the New Orleans Power Station, a 128 MW unit composed of natural gas-fired reciprocating engines, and a related cost recovery plan.  The cost estimate for the plant, which will be located at the site of the Michoud generating facility that was retired in May 2016, is $210 million.  Entergy New Orleans had previously filed an application with the City Council seeking a public interest determination and authorization to construct a 226 MW advanced combustion turbine power station.  In January 2017 several intervenors filed testimony opposing the construction of the New Orleans Power Station on various grounds.  In July 2017, Entergy New Orleans submitted a supplemental and amending application to the City Council seeking approval to construct either the originally proposed 226 MW advanced combustion turbine power station, or alternatively, the 128 MW power station.  In addition, the application renewed the commitment to pursue up to 100 MW of renewable resources to serve New Orleans.

In April 2018 intervenors opposing the construction of the New Orleans Power Station filed with the City Council a request for rehearing, which was subsequently denied, and a petition for judicial review of the City Council’s decision, and also filed a lawsuit challenging the City Council’s approval based on Louisiana’s open meeting law.  In May 2018 the City Council announced that it would initiate an investigation into allegations that Entergy New Orleans, Entergy, or some other entity paid or participated in paying certain attendees and speakers in support of the New Orleans Power Station to attend or speak at certain meetings organized by the City Council.  In October 2018 investigators for the City Council released their report, concluding that individuals were paid to attend or speak in support of the New Orleans Power Station and that Entergy New Orleans “knew or should have known that such conduct occurred or reasonably might occur.”  The City Council issued a resolution requiring Entergy New Orleans to show cause why it should not be fined $5 million as a result of the findings in the report.  In November 2018, Entergy New Orleans submitted its response to the show cause resolution, disagreeing with certain characterizations and omissions of fact in the report and asserting that the City Council could not legally impose the proposed fine.  Simultaneous with the filing of its response to the show cause resolution, Entergy New Orleans sent a letter to the City Council re-asserting that the City Council’s imposition of the proposed fine would be unlawful, but acknowledging that the actions of a subcontractor, which was retained by an Entergy New Orleans contractor without the knowledge or contractually-required consent of Entergy New Orleans, were contrary to Entergy’s values.  In that letter, Entergy New Orleans offered to donate $5 million to the City Council to resolve the show cause proceeding.  In January 2019, Entergy New Orleans submitted a new settlement proposal to the City Council.  The proposal retains the components of the first offer but adds to it a commitment to make reasonable efforts to limit the costs of the project to the $210 million cost estimate with advanced notification of anticipated cost overruns, additional reporting requirements for cost and environmental items, and a commitment regarding reliability investment and to work with the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board to provide a reliable source of power.  In February 2019 the City Council approved a resolution approving the settlement proposal and allowing the construction of the New Orleans Power Station to commence.

Also in February 2019 certain intervenors in the City Council proceeding on the New Orleans Power Station filed suit in Louisiana state court challenging the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality’s issuance of the New Orleans Power Station’s air permit.  Entergy New Orleans intervened in that lawsuit and, along with the Louisiana



Entergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Department of Environmental Quality, filed exceptions seeking dismissal of the lawsuit.  In June 2019 the state court judge sustained the exceptions and dismissed the plaintiffs’ petition with prejudice.

Also in June 2019, a state court judge in New Orleans affirmed the City Council’s approval of the New Orleans Power Station and dismissed the petition for judicial review that had been filed in April 2018.  The petitioners have filed an appeal of that ruling.  Also in June 2019, with regard to the lawsuit challenging the City Council’s decision on the basis of a violation of the open meetings law, the same state court judge in New Orleans ruled that there was a violation of the open meetings law at the February 2018 meeting of the City Council’s Utility Committee at which that Committee considered the New Orleans Power Station approval, and further ruled that, although there was no violation of the open meetings law at the March 2018 full City Council meeting at which the New Orleans Power Station was approved, both the approval of the Utility Committee and the approval of the full City Council were void.  The City Council and Entergy New Orleans each filed a suspensive appeal of the open meetings law ruling.  A suspensive appeal suspends the effect of the judgment in the open meetings law proceeding while the appeal is being taken.  The petitioners sought in the state appellate court, and then at the Louisiana Supreme Court, to terminate the suspension of the effect of the judgment, but both courts declined to do so.  Appellate briefing on the merits both in the open meetings law appeal and in the judicial review appeal occurred in November and December 2019 and oral argument in both cases was heard in January 2020.  In February 2020 the state appellate court reversed the lower court’s ruling that the City Council’s approval of the New Orleans Power Station was void due to a violation of the open meetings law at the City Council’s Utility Committee meeting in February 2018.  The state appellate court ruled that there was no violation of the open meetings law at the full City Council meeting in March 2018 and that the lower court erred in voiding the City Council resolution approving the New Orleans Power Station.  The appellate court’s decision on the appeal of the judicial review decision that affirmed the City Council’s approval of the New Orleans Power Station as in the public interest is still pending.  Construction of the plant is on schedule, with commercial operation expected in mid-2020.

Gas Infrastructure Rebuild Plan

In September 2016, Entergy New Orleans submitted to the City Council a request for authorization for Entergy New Orleans to proceed with annual incremental capital funding of $12.5 million for its gas infrastructure rebuild plan, which would replace all of Entergy New Orleans’s low pressure cast iron, steel, and vintage plastic pipe over a ten-year period commencing in 2017.  Entergy New Orleans also proposed that recovery of the investment to fund its gas infrastructure replacement plan be determined in connection with its next base rate case.  The City Council authorized Entergy New Orleans to proceed with its replacement plans and established a schedule for proceedings in advance of the rate case intended to provide an opportunity for evaluation of the gas infrastructure plan that would best serve the public interest and the effect on customers of the approval of any such plan.   In the course of that proceeding, the City Council’s advisors submitted pre-filed testimony recommending that Entergy New Orleans be allowed to continue with its condition-based approach to gas pipeline replacement to replace approximately 238 miles of low pressure pipe at a rate of approximately 25 miles per year.  The City Council’s advisors also recommended that Entergy New Orleans be required to adhere to certain reporting requirements and recognized the need to address the sustained level of investment in gas infrastructure on customer bills.  In September 2017, Entergy New Orleans filed rebuttal testimony suggesting that its recovery of future investment and customer effects would be addressed in the rate case that Entergy New Orleans was required to file in July 2018.  The procedural schedule was suspended in order to allow for resolution in the rate case proceeding.  As a result of the rate case, the City Council approved the planned gas rebuild expenditures through 2019, but rejected Entergy New Orleans’s proposed gas infrastructure rider.  Entergy New Orleans is required to submit a gas infrastructure rebuild plan to the City Council in March 2020 and to convene a working group to explore appropriate cost mitigation measures.

Renewables

In July 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the City Council requesting approval of three utility-scale solar projects totaling 90 MW.  If approved, the resource additions will allow Entergy New Orleans to make significant progress towards meeting its voluntary commitment to the City Council to add up to 100 MW of renewable energy resources.  The three projects include constructing a self-build solar plant in Orleans Parish with an



Entergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

output of 20 MW, acquiring a 50 MW solar facility in Washington Parish through a build-own-transfer acquisition, and procuring 20 MW of solar power from a project to be built in St. James Parish through a power purchase agreement.  In December 2018 the City Council advisors requested that Entergy New Orleans pursue alternative deal structures for the Washington Parish project and attempt to reduce costs for the 20 MW New Orleans Solar Station.  As a result of settlement discussions, in March 2019, Entergy New Orleans revised its application to convert the build-own transfer acquisition of the 50 MW facility in Washington Parish to a power purchase agreement.  In June 2019 the parties to the proceeding executed a stipulated settlement term sheet, which recommends that the City Council approve Entergy New Orleans’s revised application as to all three projects.  In July 2019 the City Council approved the stipulated settlement.

Sources of Capital

Entergy New Orleans’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:

•

internally generated funds;

•

cash on hand;

•

debt and preferred membership interest issuances;

•

capital contributions; and

•

bank financing under new or existing facilities.

Entergy New Orleans may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest rates are favorable.

All debt and common and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy New Orleans require prior regulatory approval.  Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements.  Entergy New Orleans has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

Entergy New Orleans’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years.

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

Entergy New Orleans has a credit facility in the amount of $25 million scheduled to expire in November 2021.  The credit facility includes fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against $10 million of the borrowing capacity of the facility.  As of December 31, 2019, there were $20 million of cash borrowings and a $0.8 million letter of credit outstanding under the facility.  In addition, Entergy New Orleans is a party to an uncommitted letter of credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to MISO.  As of December 31, 2019, a $5.6 million letter of credit was outstanding under Entergy New Orleans’s letter of credit facility.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facilities.

Entergy New Orleans obtained authorization from the FERC through October 2021 for short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $150 million at any time outstanding and long-term borrowings and securities issuances.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy New Orleans’s short-term borrowing limits.  The long-term securities issuances of Entergy New Orleans are limited to amounts authorized not only by the FERC, but also by the City Council, and the current City Council authorization extends through October 2021.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

State and Local Rate Regulation

The rates that Entergy New Orleans charges for electricity and natural gas significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.  Entergy New Orleans is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings.  A governmental agency, the City Council, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Retail Rates

As a provision of the settlement agreement approved by the City Council in May 2015 providing for the transfer from Entergy Louisiana to Entergy New Orleans of certain assets that supported the provision of service to Entergy Louisiana’s customers in Algiers, it was agreed that, with limited exceptions, no action may be taken with respect to Entergy New Orleans’s base rates until rates are implemented from a base rate case that must be filed for its electric and gas operations in 2018.  This provision eliminated the formula rate plan applicable to Algiers operations.  The limited exceptions included continued implementation of the then-remaining two years of the four-year phased-in rate increase for the Algiers area and certain exceptional cost increases or decreases in the base revenue requirement.  An additional provision of the settlement agreement allowed for continued recovery of the revenue requirement associated with the capacity and energy from Ninemile 6 received by Entergy New Orleans under a power purchase agreement with Entergy Louisiana (Algiers PPA).  The settlement authorized Entergy New Orleans to recover the remaining revenue requirement related to the Algiers PPA through base rates charged to Algiers customers.  The settlement also provided for continued implementation of the Algiers MISO recovery rider.

A 2008 rate case settlement included $3.1 million per year in electric rates to fund the Energy Smart energy efficiency programs.  The rate settlement provided an incentive for Entergy New Orleans to meet or exceed energy savings targets set by the City Council and provided a mechanism for Entergy New Orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the energy savings generated from the energy efficiency programs.  In January 2015 the City Council approved funding for the Energy Smart program from April 2015 through March 2017 using the remainder of the approximately $12.8 million of 2014 rough production cost equalization funds, with any remaining costs being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause.  This funding methodology was modified in November 2015 when the City Council directed Entergy New Orleans to use a combination of guaranteed customer savings related to a prior agreement with the City Council and rough production cost equalization funds to cover program costs prior to recovering any costs through the fuel adjustment clause.  In April 2017 the City Council approved an implementation plan for the Energy Smart program from April 2017 through December 2019.  The City Council directed that the $11.8 million balance reported for Energy Smart funds be used to continue funding the program for Entergy New Orleans’s legacy customers and that the Energy Smart Algiers program continue to be funded through the Algiers fuel adjustment clause, until additional customer funding is required for the legacy customers.  In September 2017, Entergy New Orleans filed a supplemental plan and proposed several options for an interim cost recovery mechanism necessary to recover program costs during the period between when existing funds directed to Energy Smart programs are depleted and when new rates from the 2018 combined rate case, which includes a cost recovery mechanism for Energy Smart funding, take effect.  In December 2017 the City Council approved an energy efficiency cost recovery rider as an interim funding mechanism for Energy Smart, subject to verification that no additional funding sources exist.  In June 2018 the City Council also approved a resolution recommending that Entergy New Orleans allocate approximately $13.5 million of benefits resulting from the Tax Act to Energy Smart.  In December 2019, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the City Council seeking approval of an implementation plan for the Energy Smart program from April 2020 through December 2022.  Entergy New Orleans proposed to recover the costs of the program through mechanisms previously approved by the City Council or through the energy efficiency cost recovery rider, which was approved in the 2018 combined rate case resolution.  In January 2020 the City Council’s advisors recommended that the City Council allow Entergy New Orleans to earn a utility performance incentive of 7% of Energy Smart costs for each year in which Entergy New Orleans achieves 100% of the City Council’s savings targets for Energy Smart.  The City Council is expected to decide on the matter in February 2020.



Entergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

In September 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed an electric and gas base rate case with the City Council. The filing requested a 10.5% return on equity for electric operations with opportunity to earn a 10.75% return on equity through a performance adder provision of the electric formula rate plan in subsequent years under a formula rate plan and requested a 10.75% return on equity for gas operations.  The proposed electric rates in the revised filing reflect a net reduction of $20.3 million.  The reduction in electric rates includes a base rate increase of $135.2 million, of which $131.5 million is associated with moving costs currently collected through fuel and other riders into base rates, plus a request for an advanced metering surcharge to recover $7.1 million associated with advanced metering infrastructure, offset by a net decrease of $31.1 million related to fuel and other riders.  The filing also included a proposed gas rate decrease of $142 thousand.  Entergy New Orleans’s rates reflected the inclusion of federal income tax reductions due to the Tax Act and the provisions of a previously-approved agreement in principle determining how the benefits of the Tax Act would flow.  Entergy New Orleans included cost of service studies for electric and gas operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and the projected twelve months ending December 31, 2018.  In addition, Entergy New Orleans included capital additions expected to be placed into service for the period through December 31, 2019.  Entergy New Orleans based its request for a change in rates on the projected twelve months ending December 31, 2018.

The filing’s major provisions included: (1) a new electric rate structure, which realigns the revenue requirement associated with capacity and long-term service agreement expense from certain existing riders to base revenue, provides for the recovery of the cost of advanced metering infrastructure, and partially blends rates for Entergy New Orleans’s customers residing in Algiers with customers residing in the remainder of Orleans Parish through a three-year phase-in; (2) contemporaneous cost recovery riders for investments in energy efficiency/demand response, incremental changes in capacity/long-term service agreement costs, grid modernization investment, and gas infrastructure replacement investment; and (3) formula rate plans for both electric and gas operations.  In February 2019 the City Council’s advisors and several intervenors filed testimony in response to Entergy New Orleans’s application.  The City Council’s advisors recommended, among other things, overall rate reductions of approximately $33 million in electric rates and $3.8 million in gas rates.  Certain intervenors recommended overall rate reductions of up to approximately $49 million in electric rates and $5 million in gas rates.  An evidentiary hearing was held in June 2019, and the record and post-hearing briefs were submitted in July 2019.

In October 2019 the City Council’s Utility Committee approved a resolution for a change in electric and gas rates for consideration by the full City Council that included a 9.35% return on common equity, an equity ratio of the lesser of 50% or Entergy New Orleans’s actual equity ratio, and a total reduction in revenues that Entergy New Orleans initially estimated to be approximately $39 million ($36 million electric; $3 million gas).  At its November 7, 2019 meeting, the full City Council approved the resolution that had previously been approved by the City Council’s Utility Committee.  Based on the approved resolution, in the fourth quarter 2019 Entergy New Orleans recorded an accrual of $10 million that reflects the estimate of the revenue billed in 2019 to be refunded to customers in 2020 based on an August 2019 effective date for the rate decrease.  Entergy New Orleans also recorded a total of $12 million in regulatory assets for rate case costs and information technology costs associated with integrating Algiers customers with Entergy New Orleans’s legacy system and records.  Entergy New Orleans also transferred $10 million of retired general plant costs to a regulatory asset to be recovered over a 20-year period.

The resolution directed Entergy New Orleans to submit a compliance filing within 30 days of the date of the resolution to facilitate the eventual implementation of rates, including all necessary calculations and conforming rate schedules and riders.  The electric formula rate plan rider includes, among other things, 1) a provision for forward-looking adjustments to include known and measurable changes realized up to 12 months after the evaluation period; 2) a decoupling mechanism; and 3) recognition that Entergy New Orleans is authorized to make an in-service adjustment to the formula rate plan to include the non-fuel cost of the New Orleans Power Station in rates, unless the two pending appeals in the New Orleans Power Station proceeding have not concluded.  Under this circumstance, Entergy New Orleans shall be permitted to defer the New Orleans Power Station non-fuel costs, including the cost of capital, until Entergy New Orleans commences non-fuel cost recovery.  After taking into account the requirements for submission of the compliance filing, the total annual revenue requirement reduction required by the resolution was refined to approximately $45 million ($42 million electric, including $29 million in rider reductions; $3 million gas).  In January



Entergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

2020 the City Council’s advisors found that the rates calculated by Entergy New Orleans and reflected in the December 2019 compliance filing should be implemented, except with respect to the City Council-approved energy efficiency cost recovery rider, which rider calculation should take into account events to be determined by the City Council in the future.  Also in response to the resolution, Entergy New Orleans filed timely a petition for appeal and judicial review and for stay of or injunctive relief alleging that the resolution is unlawful in failing to produce just and reasonable rates.  Based on the general acceptance of Entergy New Orleans’s compliance filing, however, during the pendency of its appeal Entergy New Orleans expects to implement the compliance filing rates in April 2020.  A hearing on the requested injunction was scheduled in Civil District Court for February 2020, but by joint motion of the City Council and Entergy New Orleans, the Civil District Court issued an order for a limited remand to the City Council to consider a potential agreement in principle/stipulation at its February 20, 2020 meeting.  On February 17, 2020, Entergy New Orleans filed with the City Council an agreement in principle between Entergy New Orleans and the City Council’s advisors.  On February 20, 2020, the full City Council voted to approve the proposed agreement in principle and issued a resolution modifying the required treatment of certain accumulated deferred income taxes.  As a result of the agreement in principle, the total annual revenue requirement reduction will be approximately

$45 million

(

$42 million

electric, including

$29 million

in rider reductions; and

$3 million

gas).   As a result, Entergy New Orleans will fully implement new rates by April 2020.  The merits of the appeal will be subject to a separate procedural schedule issued by the Civil District Court.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)

In October 2016, Entergy New Orleans filed an application seeking a finding from the City Council that Entergy New Orleans’s deployment of advanced electric and gas metering infrastructure is in the public interest.  Entergy New Orleans proposed to deploy advanced meters that enable two-way data communication; design and build a secure and reliable network to support such communications; and implement support systems.  AMI is intended to serve as the foundation of Entergy New Orleans’s modernized power grid.  The filing included an estimate of implementation costs for AMI of

$75 million

and identified a number of quantified and unquantified benefits.  Entergy New Orleans proposed a 15-year depreciable life for the new advanced meters.  Deployment of the information technology infrastructure began in 2017 and deployment of the communications network began in 2018.  Entergy New Orleans proposed to recover the cost of AMI through the implementation of a customer charge, net of certain benefits, phased in over the period 2019 through 2022.  The City Council’s advisors filed testimony in May 2017 recommending the adoption of AMI subject to certain modifications, including the denial of Entergy New Orleans’s proposed customer charge as a cost recovery mechanism. In January 2018 a settlement was reached between the City Council’s advisors and Entergy New Orleans.  In February 2018 the City Council approved the settlement, which deferred cost recovery to the 2018 Entergy New Orleans rate case, but also stated that an adjustment for 2018-2019 AMI costs can be filed in the rate case and that, for all subsequent AMI costs, the mechanism to be approved in the 2018 rate case will allow for the timely recovery of such costs.  In April 2018 the City Council adopted a resolution directing Entergy New Orleans to explore the options for accelerating the deployment of AMI.  In June 2018 the City Council approved a one-year acceleration of AMI in its service area for an incremental

$4.4 million

.  Entergy New Orleans began deployment of AMI during the first quarter of 2019 and expects to complete deployment by the end of 2020.  Entergy New Orleans will recover the undepreciated balance of its existing meters through a regulatory asset to be amortized on a straight-line basis over 12 years, as approved by the City Council.

Internal Restructuring

In July 2016, Entergy New Orleans filed an application with the City Council seeking authorization to undertake a restructuring that would result in the transfer of substantially all of the assets and operations of Entergy New Orleans, Inc. to a new entity, which would ultimately be owned by an existing Entergy subsidiary holding company.  In May 2017 the City Council adopted a resolution approving the proposed internal restructuring pursuant to an agreement in principle with the City Council advisors and certain intervenors.  Pursuant to the agreement in principle, Entergy New Orleans would credit retail customers

$10 million

in 2017,

$1.4 million

in the first quarter of the year after the transaction closes, and

$117,500

each month in the second year after the transaction closes until such time as new base rates go into effect as a result of the then-anticipated 2018 base rate case.  Entergy New Orleans began crediting retail customers



Entergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

in June 2017.  In June 2017 the FERC approved the transaction and, pursuant to the agreement in principle, Entergy New Orleans will provide additional credits to retail customers of

$5 million

in each of the years 2018, 2019, and 2020.

In November 2017, Entergy New Orleans undertook a multi-step restructuring, including the following:

•

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. redeemed its outstanding preferred stock at a price of approximately

$21 million

, which included a call premium of approximately

$819,000

, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends.

•

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. converted from a Louisiana corporation to a Texas corporation.

•

Under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Entergy New Orleans, Inc. allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy New Orleans Power, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Entergy New Orleans Power), and Entergy New Orleans Power assumed substantially all of the liabilities of Entergy New Orleans, Inc. in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC.  Entergy New Orleans, Inc. remained in existence and held the membership interests in Entergy New Orleans Power.

•

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. contributed the membership interests in Entergy New Orleans Power to an affiliate (Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and subsidiary of Entergy Corporation).  As a result of the contribution, Entergy New Orleans Power is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC.

In December 2017, Entergy New Orleans, Inc. changed its name to Entergy Utility Group, Inc., and Entergy New Orleans Power then changed its name to Entergy New Orleans, LLC.  Entergy New Orleans, LLC holds substantially all of the assets, and has assumed substantially all of the liabilities, of Entergy New Orleans, Inc.  The restructuring was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control.

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery

Entergy New Orleans’s electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

Entergy New Orleans’s gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges.

Show Cause Order

In July 2016 the City Council approved the issuance of a show cause order, which directed Entergy New Orleans to make a filing on or before September 29, 2016 to demonstrate the reasonableness of its actions or positions with regard to certain issues in four existing dockets that relate to Entergy New Orleans’s: (i) storm hardening proposal; (ii) 2015 integrated resource plan; (iii) gas infrastructure rebuild proposal; and (iv) proposed sizing of the New Orleans Power Station and its community outreach prior to the filing.  In September 2016, Entergy New Orleans filed its response to the City Council’s show cause order.  The City Council has not established any further procedural schedule with regard to this proceeding.

Reliability Investigation

In August 2017 the City Council established a docket to investigate the reliability of the Entergy New Orleans distribution system and to consider implementing certain reliability standards and possible financial penalties for not meeting any such standards.  In April 2018 the City Council adopted a resolution directing Entergy New Orleans to demonstrate that it has been prudent in the management and maintenance of the reliability of its distribution system.  The resolution also called for Entergy New Orleans to file a revised reliability plan addressing the current state of its distribution system and proposing remedial measures for increasing reliability.  In June 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed its response to the City Council’s resolution regarding the prudence of its management and maintenance of the reliability of its distribution system.  In July 2018, Entergy New Orleans filed its revised reliability plan discussing the various reliability programs that it uses to improve distribution system reliability and discussing generally the positive effect that advanced meter deployment and grid modernization can have on future reliability.  Entergy New Orleans has retained a national consulting firm with expertise in distribution system reliability to conduct a review of Entergy New Orleans’s distribution system reliability-related practices and procedures and to provide recommendations for improving distribution system reliability.  The report was filed with the City Council in October 2018.  The City Council also approved a resolution that opens a prudence investigation into whether Entergy New Orleans was imprudent for not acting sooner to address outages in New Orleans and whether fines should be imposed.  In January 2019, Entergy New Orleans filed testimony in response to the prudence investigation and asserting that it had been prudent in managing system reliability.  In April 2019 the City Council advisors filed comments and testimony asserting that Entergy New Orleans did not act prudently in maintaining and improving its distribution system reliability in recent years and recommending that a financial penalty in the range of $1.5 million to $2 million should be assessed.  Entergy New Orleans disagrees with the recommendation and submitted rebuttal testimony and rebuttal comments in June 2019.  In November 2019 the City Council passed a resolution that penalized Entergy New Orleans $1 million for alleged imprudence in the maintenance of its distribution system.  In December 2019, Entergy New Orleans filed suit in Louisiana state court seeking judicial review of the City Council’s resolution.

Renewable Portfolio Standard Rulemaking

In March 2019 the City Council initiated a rulemaking proceeding to consider whether to establish a renewable portfolio standard.  The rulemaking will consider, among other issues, whether to adopt a renewable portfolio standard, whether such standard should be voluntary or mandatory, what kinds of technologies should qualify for inclusion in the rules, what level, if any, of renewable generation should be required, and whether penalties are an appropriate component of the proposed rules. Parties to the proceeding submitted initial comments in June 2019 and reply comments in July 2019.  Entergy New Orleans recommends that the City Council adopt a voluntary clean energy standard of 70% of generation being clean energy by 2030, as so defined, which, in addition to renewable generation, would include nuclear, beneficial electrification, and demand-side management as compliant technologies.  Several other industry leaders, academic researchers, and environmental advocates filed comments also supporting a clean energy standard.  Other parties, including many representatives of the solar and wind industry, are recommending mandatory, renewables-only requirements of up to 100% renewable resources by 2040.  In September 2019 the City Council advisors issued a report and recommendations, which also put forth three alternative rules for comment from the parties.  Comments were submitted in October 2019 and replies were filed in November 2019.  Further City Council action, including the establishment of additional procedural steps for the rulemaking, is expected in the first quarter of 2020.

Environmental Risks

Entergy New Orleans’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes that Entergy New Orleans is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in “

Regulation of Entergy’s Business

-

” in Part I, Item 1.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of Entergy New Orleans’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of Entergy New Orleans’s financial position or results of operations.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy New Orleans’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.  See the “

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

ENTERGY TEXAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Results of Operations

2019 Compared to 2018

Net Income

Net income decreased $2.8 million primarily due to a higher effective income tax rate, after excluding the effect of the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes which is offset in operating revenues, higher depreciation and amortization expenses and higher other operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher retail electric price and higher other income.

Operating Revenues

Following is an analysis of the change in operating revenue comparing 2019 to 2018.

Entergy Texas’s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. “Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income” includes the revenue variance associated with these items.

The return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers resulted from the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes through a rider effective October 2018.  In 2019, $87.4 million was returned to customers as compared to $14.6 million in 2018.  There is no effect on net income as the reduction in operating revenues is offset by a reduction in income tax expense. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a base rate increase effective October 2018 as approved

by the PUCT.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case.

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in usage during the unbilled sales period.

Other Income Statement Variances

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:

•

an increase of $5.1 million in information technology costs primarily due to higher costs related to applications



Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

and infrastructure support, enhanced cyber security, and upgrades and maintenance;

•

an increase of $4.7 million in spending on initiatives to explore new customer products and services;

•

an increase of $3.9 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to a higher scope of work performed during plant outages in 2019 as compared to 2018; and

•

an increase of $3.4 million in distribution operations and asset management costs primarily due to higher contract costs for meter reading services and higher advanced metering customer education costs.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily as a result of new depreciation rates established in the settlement of the 2018 base rate case and additions to plant in service.

Other regulatory charges (credits) include regulatory charges of $25.4 million recorded in 2018 to reflect the effects of a provision in the settlement reached in the 2018 rate case proceeding to return the benefits of the lower federal income tax rate in 2018 to customers.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the rate case proceeding.

Other income increased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2019, including the Montgomery County Power Station project.

Interest expense decreased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2019, including the Montgomery County Power Station project.

The effective income tax rates were (51.1%) for 2019 and (19.3%) for 2018.  The difference in the effective income tax rate of (51.1%) versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2019 was primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes and book and tax differences related to the allowance for equity funds used during construction.  The difference in the effective income tax rate of (19.3%) versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2018 was primarily due to the flow through and amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes, along with the effect on income tax expense of the resolution of Entergy Texas’s 2018 base rate proceeding.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows:

2019 Compared to 2018

Operating Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $45 million in 2019 primarily due to the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers and the receipt of $33.2 million in 2018 from Entergy Arkansas as a result of a compliance filing made in response to the FERC’s October 2018 order in the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales proceeding.  The decrease was partially offset by the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs and the timing of collection of receivables from customers.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the opportunity sales proceeding and regulatory activity regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Investing Activities

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $482.3 million in 2019 primarily due to:

•

an increase of $243.3 million in fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures primarily due to increased spending on the Montgomery County Power Station;

•

an increase of $153.4 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to a higher scope of work performed in 2019 as compared to 2018;

•

an increase of $47.1 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to investment in the reliability and infrastructure of Entergy Texas’s distribution system, including increased spending on advanced metering infrastructure, and increased storm spending; and

•

money pool activity.

Increases in Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool increased by $11.2 million in 2019 compared to decreasing $44.9 million in 2018.  The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

Financing Activities

Entergy Texas’s financing activities provided $604.4 million of cash in 2019 compared to using $51.2 million of cash in 2018 primarily due to:



Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

•

the issuance of $300 million of 4.0% Series mortgage bonds and $400 million of 4.5% Series mortgage bonds in January 2019;

•

the issuance of $300 million of 3.55% Series mortgage bonds in September 2019;

•

capital contributions of $185 million in 2019 received from Entergy Corporation in anticipation of upcoming construction expenditures, including Montgomery County Power Station; and

•

the issuance of $35 million aggregate liquidation value 5.375% Series A preferred stock in September 2019.

The increase was partially offset by the repayment, at maturity, of $500 million of 7.125% Series mortgage bonds in

February 2019 and money pool activity. See Note 5 to the financial statements for more details on long-term debt. See Note 6 to the financial statements for more details on the issuance of preferred stock.

Decreases in Entergy Texas’s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s payable

to the money pool decreased by $22.4 million in 2019 compared to increasing by $22.4 million in 2018.

Cash Flow

” in Entergy Texas’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow activities for 2018 compared to 2017.

Capital Structure

Entergy Texas’s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table.  The increase in the debt to capital ratio

for Entergy Texas is primarily due to the net issuance of $500 million of mortgage bonds in 2019, partially offset by

an increase in equity.

(a)

Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Texas.

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents.  Debt consists of long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion.  Capital consists of debt and equity.  Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents.  Entergy Texas uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Texas’s financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy Texas, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial statements.  Entergy Texas also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Texas’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Texas’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

Entergy Texas seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure. To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, Entergy Texas may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its  capital structure.  In addition, Entergy Texas may receive equity



Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

contributions to maintain its capital structure for certain circumstances such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reduced dividends.

Uses of Capital

Entergy Texas requires capital resources for:

•

construction and other capital investments;

•

debt maturities or retirements;

•

working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and

•

dividend and interest payments.

Following are the amounts of Entergy Texas’s planned construction and other capital investments.

Following are the amounts of Entergy Texas’s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments) and other purchase obligations.

(a)

Includes estimated interest payments.  Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.

(b)

Lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements.

(c)

Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services.  For Entergy Texas, it primarily includes unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations.

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Texas expects to contribute approximately $3.5 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $61 thousand to other postretirement health care and life insurance plans in 2020, although the 2020 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2020 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2020.  See “

Critical Accounting Estimates

- Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Texas has $17.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

In addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Texas includes specific investments such as the Montgomery County Power Station; transmission projects to enhance reliability, reduce congestion, and enable economic growth; distribution spending to enhance reliability and improve service to customers, including advanced meters and related investments; system improvements; software and security; and other investments. Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital.  Management provides more information on long-term debt in Note 5 to the financial statements.

As a subsidiary, Entergy Texas dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly.

Montgomery County Power Station

In October 2016, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT seeking certification that the public convenience and necessity would be served by the construction of the Montgomery County Power Station, a nominal 993 MW combined-cycle generating unit in Willis, Texas, on land adjacent to the existing Lewis Creek plant.  The current estimated cost of the Montgomery County Power Station is $937 million, including approximately $111 million of transmission interconnection and network upgrades and other related costs.  The independent monitor, who oversaw the request for proposal process, filed testimony and a report affirming that the Montgomery County Power Station was selected through an objective and fair request for proposal process that showed no undue preference to any proposal.  In June 2017 parties to the proceeding filed an unopposed stipulation and settlement agreement.  The stipulation contemplates that Entergy Texas’s level of cost-recovery for generation construction costs for Montgomery County Power Station is capped at $831 million, subject to certain exclusions such as force majeure events.  Transmission interconnection and network upgrades and other related costs are not subject to the $831 million cap.  In July 2017 the PUCT approved the stipulation.  Subject to the timely receipt of other permits and approvals, commercial operation is estimated to occur by mid-2021.

Sources of Capital

Entergy Texas’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:

•

internally generated funds;

•

cash on hand;

•

debt or preferred stock issuances;

•

capital contributions; and

•

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.



Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Entergy Texas has a credit facility in the amount of $150 million scheduled to expire in September 2024.  The credit facility includes fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against $30 million of the borrowing capacity of the facility.  As of December 31, 2019, there were no cash borrowings and $1.3 million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility.  In addition, Entergy Texas is a party to an uncommitted letter of credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to MISO.  As of December 31, 2019, a $12.1 million letter of credit was outstanding under Entergy Texas’s letter of credit facility.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facilities.

Entergy Texas obtained authorizations from the FERC through November 2020 for short-term borrowings, not to exceed an aggregate amount of $200 million at any time outstanding, and long-term borrowings and security issuances.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Texas’s short-term borrowing limits.

State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery

The rates that Entergy Texas charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.  Entergy Texas is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings.  The PUCT, a governmental agency, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Filings with the PUCT

2018 Rate Case

I

n May 2018, Entergy Texas filed a base rate case with the PUCT seeking an increase in base rates and rider rates of approximately $166 million, of which $48 million is associated with moving costs currently being collected through riders into base rates such that the total incremental revenue requirement increase is approximately $118 million.  The base rate case was based on a 12-month test year ending December 31, 2017.  In addition, Entergy Texas included capital additions placed into service for the period of April 1, 2013 through December 31, 2017, as well as a post-test year adjustment to include capital additions placed in service by June 30, 2018.

In October 2018 the parties filed an unopposed settlement resolving all issues in the proceeding and a motion for interim rates effective for usage on and after October 17, 2018.  The unopposed settlement reflects the following terms: a base rate increase of $53.2 million (net of costs realigned from riders and including updated depreciation rates), a $25 million refund to reflect the lower federal income tax rate applicable to Entergy Texas from January 25, 2018 through the date new rates are implemented, $6 million of capitalized skylining tree hazard costs will not be recovered from customers, $242.5 million of protected excess accumulated deferred income taxes, which includes a tax gross-up, will be returned to customers through base rates under the average rate assumption method over the lives of the associated assets, and $185.2 million of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes, which includes a tax gross-up, will be returned to customers through a rider.  The unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes rider will include carrying charges and will be in effect over a period of 12 months for large customers and over a period of four years for other customers.  The settlement also provides for the deferral of

$24.5 million

of costs associated with the remaining book value of the Neches and Sabine 2 plants, previously taken out of service, to be recovered over a ten-year period and the deferral of

$20.5 million

of costs associated with Hurricane Harvey to be recovered over a 12-year period, each beginning in October 2018.  The settlement provides final resolution of all issues in the matter, including those related to the Tax Act.  In October 2018 the ALJ granted the unopposed motion for interim rates to be effective for service rendered on or after October 17, 2018.  In December 2018 the PUCT issued an order approving the unopposed settlement.

In January 2019, Entergy Texas filed for recovery of rate case expenses totaling $7.2 million.  The amounts requested primarily include internal and external expenses related to litigating the 2018 base rate case.  Parties filed testimony in April 2019 recommending a disallowance ranging from $3.2 million to $4.2 million of the $7.2 million requested.  In May 2019, Entergy Texas filed rebuttal testimony responding to the parties’ positions.  In September 2019 an order was issued abating the procedural schedule and scheduled hearing to allow the finalization of a settlement



Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

in principle reached among the parties.  The settlement provides for a black box disallowance of $1.4 million.  In the third quarter 2019, Entergy Texas recorded a provision for the 2018 base rate case expenses based on the settlement in principle.  In October 2019 the settlement was filed for review by the PUCT.  In February 2020 the PUCT approved the settlement.

Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF) Rider

In June 2017, Entergy Texas filed an application to amend its DCRF rider by increasing the total collection from $8.65 million to approximately $19 million.  In July 2017, Entergy Texas, the PUCT staff, and the two other parties in the proceeding entered into an unopposed stipulation and settlement agreement resulting in an amended DCRF annual revenue requirement of $18.3 million.  In September 2017 the PUCT issued its final order approving the unopposed stipulation and settlement agreement.  The amended DCRF rider rates became effective for usage on and after September 1, 2017.  DCRF rates were set to zero upon implementation of new base rates on October 17, 2018, as described above in the 2018 base rate case discussion.

In March 2019, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to set a new DCRF rider.  The proposed new DCRF rider is designed to collect approximately $3.2 million annually from Entergy Texas’s retail customers based on its capital invested in distribution between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018.   In September 2019 the PUCT issued an order approving rates, which had been effective on an interim basis since June 2019, at the level proposed in Entergy Texas’s application.

Transmission Cost Recovery Factor (TCRF) Rider

In September 2016, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its TCRF rider.  The proposed amended TCRF rider was designed to collect approximately

$29.5 million

annually from Entergy Texas’s retail customers.  In December 2016, concurrent with the 2016 fuel reconciliation stipulation and settlement agreement discussed below, Entergy Texas and the PUCT staff reached a settlement agreeing to the amended TCRF annual revenue requirement of

$29.5 million

.  As discussed below, the terms of the two settlements are interdependent.  The PUCT approved the settlement and issued a final order in March 2017.  Entergy Texas implemented the amended TCRF rider beginning with bills covering usage on and after March 20, 2017.  TCRF rates were set to zero upon implementation of new base rates on October 17, 2018, as discussed above in the 2018 base rate case discussion.

In December 2018, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to set a new TCRF rider.  The proposed new TCRF rider is designed to collect approximately $2.7 million annually from Entergy Texas’s retail customers based on its capital invested in transmission between January 1, 2018 and September 30, 2018.  In April 2019 parties filed testimony proposing a load growth adjustment, which would fully offset Entergy Texas’s proposed TCRF revenue requirement.  In July 2019 the PUCT granted Entergy Texas’s application as filed to begin recovery of the requested $2.7 million annual revenue requirement, rejecting opposing parties’ proposed adjustment; however, the PUCT found that the question of prudence of the actual investment costs should be determined in Entergy Texas’s next rate case similar to the procedure used for the costs recovered through the DCRF rider.  In October 2019 the PUCT issued an order on a motion for rehearing, clarifying and affirming its prior order granting Entergy Texas’s application as filed.  Also, in October 2019 a second motion for rehearing was filed, and Entergy Texas filed a response in opposition to the motion.  The second motion for rehearing was overruled by operation of law.  In December 2019, Texas Industrial Energy Consumers filed an appeal to the PUCT order in district court alleging that the PUCT erred in declining to apply a load growth adjustment.

In August 2019, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its TCRF rider.  The proposed new TCRF rider is designed to collect approximately $19.4 million annually from Entergy Texas’s retail customers based on its capital invested in transmission between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019, which is $16.7 million in incremental annual revenue above the $2.7 million approved in the prior pending TCRF proceeding.  In November 2019, Entergy Texas filed an unopposed stipulation and settlement agreement providing for recovery of the requested revenue requirement.  In January 2020 the PUCT issued an order approving the unopposed settlement.



Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)

In April 2017 the Texas legislature enacted legislation that extends statutory support for AMI deployment to Entergy Texas and directs that if Entergy Texas elects to deploy AMI, it shall do so as rapidly as practicable.  In July 2017, Entergy Texas filed an application seeking an order from the PUCT approving Entergy Texas’s deployment of AMI.  Entergy Texas proposed to replace existing meters with advanced meters that enable two-way data communication; design and build a secure and reliable network to support such communications; and implement support systems.  AMI is intended to serve as the foundation of Entergy Texas’s modernized power grid.  The filing included an estimate of implementation costs for AMI of

$132 million

and identified a number of quantified and unquantified benefits.  Entergy Texas proposed a seven-year depreciable life for the new advanced meters.  Entergy Texas also proposed a surcharge tariff to recover the reasonable and necessary costs it has and will incur under the deployment plan for the full deployment of advanced meters.  Further, Entergy Texas sought approval of fees that would be charged to customers who choose to opt out of receiving service through an advanced meter and instead receive electric service with a non-standard meter.  In October 2017, Entergy Texas and other parties entered into and filed an unopposed stipulation and settlement agreement permitting deployment of AMI with limited modifications.  The PUCT approved the stipulation and settlement agreement in December 2017.  Entergy Texas implemented the AMI surcharge tariff beginning with January 2018 bills.  As of December 31, 2019, Entergy Texas has a regulatory liability related to the collection of the surcharge from customers.  Consistent with the approval, deployment of the communications network began in 2018 and the three-year deployment of the advanced meters began in 2019.  Entergy Texas will recover the undepreciated balance of its existing meters through a regulatory asset to be amortized at current depreciation rates, as approved by the PUCT.

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery

Entergy Texas’s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including interest, not recovered in base rates.   Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix.  The amounts collected under Entergy Texas’s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT.

In July 2015 certain parties filed briefs in the open proceeding asserting that Entergy Texas should refund to retail customers an additional

$10.9 million

in bandwidth remedy payments Entergy Texas received related to calendar year 2006 production costs.  In October 2015 an ALJ issued a proposal for decision recommending that the additional $10.9 million in bandwidth remedy payments be refunded to retail customers.  In January 2016 the PUCT issued its order affirming the ALJ’s recommendation, and Entergy Texas filed a motion for rehearing of the PUCT’s decision, which the PUCT denied.  In March 2016, Entergy Texas filed a complaint in Federal District Court for the Western District of Texas and a petition in the Travis County (State) District Court appealing the PUCT’s decision.  The pending appeals did not stay the PUCT’s decision.  In April 2016, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT an application to refund to customers approximately

$56.2 million

.  The refund resulted from (i)

$41.8 million

of fuel cost recovery over-collections through February 2016, (ii) the

$10.9 million

in bandwidth remedy payments, discussed above, that Entergy Texas received related to calendar year 2006 production costs, and (iii)

$3.5 million

in bandwidth remedy payments that Entergy Texas received related to 2006-2008 production costs.  In June 2016, Entergy Texas filed an unopposed settlement agreement that added additional over-recovered fuel costs for the months of March and April 2016.  The settlement resulted in a

$68 million

refund.  The ALJ approved the refund on an interim basis and it was made to most customers over a four-month period beginning with the first billing cycle of July 2016.  In July 2016 the PUCT issued an order approving the interim refund. The federal appeal of the PUCT’s January 2016 decision was heard in December 2016, and the Federal District Court granted Entergy Texas’s requested relief.  In January 2017 the PUCT and an intervenor filed petitions for appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit of the Federal District Court ruling.  Oral argument was held before the Fifth Circuit in February 2018. In April 2018 the Fifth Circuit reversed the decision of the Federal District Court, reinstating the original PUCT decision.  In October 2018, Entergy Texas filed a notice of nonsuit in its appeal to the Travis County District Court regarding the PUCT’s January 2016 decision.



Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

In July 2016, Entergy Texas filed an application to reconcile its fuel and purchased power costs for the period April 1, 2013 through March 31, 2016.  During the reconciliation period, Entergy Texas incurred approximately

$1.77 billion

in Texas jurisdictional eligible fuel and purchased power expenses, net of certain revenues credited to such expenses and other adjustments.  Entergy Texas estimated an over-recovery balance of approximately

$19.3 million

, including interest, which Entergy Texas requested authority to carry over as the beginning balance for the subsequent reconciliation period beginning April 2016.  Entergy Texas also noted, however, that the estimated $19.3 million over collection was being refunded to customers as a portion of the interim fuel refund beginning with the first billing cycle of July 2016, discussed above.  Entergy Texas also requested a prudence finding for each of the fuel-related contracts and arrangements entered into or modified during the reconciliation period that have not been reviewed by the PUCT in a prior proceeding.  In December 2016, Entergy Texas entered into a stipulation and settlement agreement resulting in a

$6 million

disallowance not associated with any particular issue raised and a refund of the over-recovery balance of

$21 million

as of November 30, 2016, to most customers beginning April 2017 through June 2017.  This settlement was developed concurrently with the stipulation and settlement agreement in the 2016 transmission cost recovery factor rider amendment discussed above, and the terms and conditions in both settlements are interdependent.  The fuel reconciliation settlement was approved by the PUCT in March 2017 and the refunds were made.

In June 2017, Entergy Texas filed an application for a fuel refund of approximately

$30.7 million

for the months of December 2016 through April 2017.  For most customers, the refunds flowed through bills for the months of July 2017 through September 2017.  The fuel refund was approved by the PUCT in August 2017.

In December 2017, Entergy Texas filed an application for a fuel refund of approximately $30.5 million for the months of May 2017 through October 2017.  Also in December 2017, the PUCT’s ALJ approved the refund on an interim basis.  For most customers, the refunds flowed through bills January 2018 through March 2018.  The fuel refund was approved by the PUCT in March 2018.

In September 2019, Entergy Texas filed an application to reconcile its fuel and purchased power costs for the period from April 2016 through March 2019.  During the reconciliation period, Entergy Texas incurred approximately $1.6 billion in Texas jurisdictional eligible fuel and purchased power expenses, net of certain revenues credited to such expenses and other adjustments.  Entergy Texas estimated an under-recovery balance of approximately $25.8 million, including interest, which Entergy Texas requested authority to carry over as the beginning balance for the subsequent reconciliation period beginning April 2019.  The proceeding is currently pending.

Industrial and Commercial Customers

Entergy Texas’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs.  In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Texas’s industrial customer base.  Entergy Texas responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide, under existing rate schedules, competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles.  Entergy Texas actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers.



Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Environmental Risks

Entergy Texas’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes that Entergy Texas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in “

Regulation of Entergy’s Business

-

Environmental Regulation

” in Part I, Item 1.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of Entergy Texas’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Texas’s financial position or results of operations.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy Texas’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.   See the “

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

” in the “

Critical Accounting Estimates

” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries’ Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.

Costs and Employer Contributions

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Texas in 2019 was $5.7 million.  Entergy Texas anticipates 2020 qualified pension cost to be $8.4 million.  Entergy Texas contributed $3.7 million to its qualified pension plans in 2019 and estimates 2020 pension contributions will be approximately $3.5 million, although the 2020 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2020 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2020.

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for Entergy Texas in 2019 was $6.5 million.  Entergy Texas expects 2020 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income to approximate $6.7 million. In 2019, Entergy Texas’ postretirement contributions (that is, contributions to the external trusts plus claims payments) were offset by trust claims reimbursements, resulting in a net reimbursement of $596 thousand. Entergy Texas estimates 2020 contributions will be approximately $61 thousand.

SYSTEM ENERGY RESOURCES, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

System Energy’s principal asset currently consists of an ownership interest and a leasehold interest in Grand Gulf.  The capacity and energy from its 90% interest is sold under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to its only four customers, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.  System Energy’s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% interest in Grand Gulf pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy’s only source of operating revenues.

Results of Operations

2019 Compared to 2018

Net Income

Net income increased $5 million primarily due to the increase in operating revenues resulting from changes in rate base, as compared to prior year, and a lower effective income tax rate, after excluding the effect of the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers which is offset in income taxes.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rates were 13.4% for 2019 and (102.7%) for 2018.  The difference in the effective income tax rate of 13.4% versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2019 was primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes and certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items, partially offset by state income taxes.  The difference in the effective income tax rate of (102.7%) versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2018 was primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow

Cash flows for the years ended December 31,


,


, and


were as follows:

2019 Compared to 2018

Operating Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $198.8 million in 2019 primarily due to:

•

the decrease in the return of the unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes in 2018;

•

a decrease in spending of $48.5 million on nuclear refueling outages in 2019 as compared to prior year; and

•

a decrease of $51.7 million in income taxes paid in 2019.  System Energy made income tax payments of $54 million in 2018 in accordance with an intercompany income tax allocation agreement.

Investing Activities

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased by $166.6 million in 2019 primarily due to:

•

a decrease of $102.7 million as a result of fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements in the Utility business, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle;

•

money pool activity; and

•

a decrease of $28.4 million in nuclear construction expenditures as a result of spending in 2018 on Grand Gulf outage projects.

Decreases in System Energy’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow and System Energy’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $47.8 million in 2019 compared to decreasing by $4.5 million in 2018.  The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings.

Financing Activities

Net cash flow used in financing activities increased $201.1 million in 2019 primarily due to:

•

the issuance in March 2018 of $100 million of 3.42% Series J notes by the System Energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity;



System Energy Resources, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

•

an increase of $56.5 million in common stock dividends and distributions in 2019.  Common stock dividends and distributions were lower in 2018 in anticipation of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes being returned to customers as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and

•

net repayments of $82.3 million of long-term borrowings in 2019 compared to net borrowings of $63.9 million of long-term borrowings in 2018 on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity’s credit facility.

The increase was partially offset by:

•

the payment in October 2018, at maturity, of $85 million of the System Energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity’s 3.78% Series I notes; and

•

net repayments of short-term borrowings of $17.8 million in 2018 on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity’s credit facility.

In March 2019, System Energy issued $134 million of 2.50% Series 2019 revenue refunding bonds due April 2022.  The proceeds were used to redeem, prior to maturity, $134 million of 5.875% Series 1998 pollution control revenue refunding bonds due April 2022.

Capital Structure

System Energy’s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table.  The decrease in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to a decrease in long-term debt outstanding, partially offset by a decrease in retained earnings.

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents.  Debt consists of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion.  Capital consists of debt and common equity.  Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents.  System Energy uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy’s financial condition.  System Energy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy’s financial condition because net debt indicates System Energy’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.

System Energy seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings.  To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure.  To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, System Energy may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its capital structure.

Uses of Capital

System Energy requires capital resources for:

•

construction and other capital investments;

•

debt maturities or retirements;

•

working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel costs; and

•

dividend, distribution, and interest payments.

Following are the amounts of System Energy’s planned construction and other capital investments.

Following are the amounts of System Energy’s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments) and other purchase obligations.

(a)

Includes estimated interest payments.  Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.

(b)

Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services.  For System Energy, it includes nuclear fuel purchase obligations.

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, System Energy expects to contribute approximately $10.5 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $21 thousand to other postretirement health care and life insurance plans in 2020, although the 2020 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2020 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2020.  See “

Critical Accounting Estimates

– Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, System Energy has $464.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

In addition to routine spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate includes specific Grand Gulf investments and initiatives.

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, System Energy dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly.



System Energy Resources, Inc.

Sources of Capital

System Energy’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:

•

internally generated funds;

•

cash on hand;

•

debt issuances; and

•

bank financing under new or existing facilities.

System Energy may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest rates are favorable.

All debt issuances by System Energy require prior regulatory approval.  Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indenture and other agreements.  System Energy has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

System Energy’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years.

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

The System Energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity has a credit facility in the amount of $120 million scheduled to expire in September 2021.  As of December 31, 2019, $31.6 million in loans were outstanding under the System Energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facility.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the variable interest entity credit facility.

System Energy obtained authorizations from the FERC through November 2020 for the following:

•

short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $200 million at any time outstanding;

•

long-term borrowings and security issuances; and

•

borrowings by its nuclear fuel company variable interest entity.

Complaints Against System Energy

Return on Equity and Capital Structure Complaints

In January 2017 the APSC and MPSC filed a complaint with the FERC against System Energy.  The complaint seeks a reduction in the return on equity component of the Unit Power Sales Agreement pursuant to which System Energy sells its Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.  Entergy Arkansas also sells some of its Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Louisiana,



System Energy Resources, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under separate agreements.  The current return on equity under the Unit Power Sales Agreement is

10.94%

, which was established in a rate proceeding that became final in July 2001.

The APSC and MPSC complaint alleges that the return on equity is unjust and unreasonable because capital market and other considerations indicate that it is excessive.  The complaint requests the FERC to institute proceedings to investigate the return on equity and establish a lower return on equity, and also requests that the FERC establish January 23, 2017 as a refund effective date.  The complaint includes return on equity analysis that purports to establish that the range of reasonable return on equity for System Energy is between

8.37%

and

8.67%

.  System Energy answered the complaint in February 2017 and disputes that a return on equity of

8.37%

to

8.67%

is just and reasonable.  The LPSC and the City Council intervened in the proceeding expressing support for the complaint.  System Energy is recording a provision against revenue for the potential outcome of this proceeding.  In September 2017 the FERC established a refund effective date of January 23, 2017 and directed the parties to engage in settlement proceedings before an ALJ.  The parties have been unable to settle the return on equity issue and a FERC hearing judge was assigned in July 2018.  The 15-month refund period in connection with the APSC/MPSC complaint expired on April 23, 2018.

In April 2018 the LPSC filed a complaint with the FERC against System Energy seeking an additional 15-month refund period.  The LPSC complaint requests similar relief from the FERC with respect to System Energy’s return on equity and also requests the FERC to investigate System Energy’s capital structure.  The APSC, MPSC, and City Council intervened in the proceeding, filed an answer expressing support for the complaint, and asked the FERC to consolidate this proceeding with the proceeding initiated by the complaint of the APSC and MPSC in January 2017.  System Energy answered the LPSC complaint in May 2018 and also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.  The 15-month refund period in connection with the LPSC return on equity complaint expired on July 26, 2019.

In August 2018 the FERC issued an order dismissing the LPSC’s request to investigate System Energy’s capital structure and setting for hearing the return on equity complaint, with a refund effective date of April 27, 2018.  The portion of the LPSC’s complaint dealing with return on equity was subsequently consolidated with the APSC and MPSC complaint for hearing.  The parties are required to address an order (issued in a separate proceeding involving New England transmission owners) that proposed modifying the FERC’s standard methodology for determining return on equity.  In September 2018, System Energy filed a request for rehearing and the LPSC filed a request for rehearing or reconsideration of the FERC’s August 2018 order.  The LPSC’s request referenced an amended complaint that it filed on the same day raising the same capital structure claim the FERC had earlier dismissed.  The FERC initiated a new proceeding for the amended capital structure complaint, and System Energy submitted a response in October 2018.  In January 2019 the FERC set the amended complaint for settlement and hearing proceedings.  Settlement proceedings in the capital structure proceeding commenced in February 2019.  As noted below, in June 2019 settlement discussions were terminated and the amended capital structure complaint was consolidated with the ongoing return on equity proceeding.  The 15-month refund period in connection with the capital structure complaint is from September 24, 2018 to December 23, 2019.

In January 2019 the LPSC and the APSC and MPSC filed direct testimony in the return on equity proceeding.  For the refund period January 23, 2017 through April 23, 2018, the LPSC argues for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

7.81%

and the APSC and MPSC argue for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

8.24%

.  For the refund period April 27, 2018 through July 27, 2019, and for application on a prospective basis, the LPSC argues for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

7.97%

and the APSC and MPSC argue for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

8.41%

. In March 2019, System Energy submitted answering testimony in the return on equity proceeding.  For the first refund period, System Energy’s testimony argues for a return on equity of

10.10%

(median) or

10.70%

(midpoint).  For the second refund period, System Energy’s testimony shows that the calculated returns on equity for the first period fall within the range of presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity, and thus the second complaint should be dismissed (and the first period return on equity used going forward). If the FERC nonetheless were to set a new return on equity for the second period (and going forward), System Energy argues the return on equity should be either

10.32%

(median) or

10.69%

(midpoint).



System Energy Resources, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

In May 2019 the FERC trial staff filed its direct and answering testimony in the return on equity proceeding.  For the first refund period, the FERC trial staff calculates an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

9.89%

based on the application of FERC’s proposed methodology.  The FERC trial staff’s direct and answering testimony noted that an authorized return on equity of

9.89%

for the first refund period was within the range of presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity for the second refund period, as calculated using a study period ending January 31, 2019 for the second refund period.

In June 2019, System Entergy filed testimony responding to the testimony filed by the FERC trial staff.  Among other things, System Energy’s testimony rebutted arguments raised by the FERC trial staff and provided updated calculations for the second refund period based on the study period ending May 31, 2019.  For that refund period, System Energy’s testimony shows that strict application of the return on equity methodology proposed by the FERC staff indicates that the second complaint would not be dismissed, and the new return on equity would be set at

9.65%

(median) or

9.74%

(midpoint).  System Energy’s testimony argues that these results are insufficient in light of benchmarks such as state returns on equity and treasury bond yields, and instead proposes that the calculated returns on equity for the second period should be either

9.91%

(median) or

10.3%

(midpoint).  System Energy’s testimony also argues that, under application of its proposed modified methodology, the

10.10%

return on equity calculated for the first refund period would fall within the range of presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity for the second refund period.  System Energy is recording a provision against revenue for the potential outcome of this proceeding.

Also in June 2019, the FERC’s Chief ALJ issued an order terminating settlement discussions in the amended complaint addressing System Energy’s capital structure.  The ALJ consolidated the amended capital structure complaint with the ongoing return on equity proceeding and set new procedural deadlines for the consolidated hearing.

In August 2019 the LPSC and the APSC and MPSC filed rebuttal testimony in the return on equity proceeding and direct and answering testimony relating to System Energy’s capital structure.  The LPSC reargues for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

7.81%

for the first refund period and

7.97%

for the second refund period.  The APSC and MPSC argue for an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

8.26%

for the first refund period and

8.32%

for the second refund period.  With respect to capital structure, the LPSC proposes that the FERC establish a hypothetical capital structure for System Energy for ratemaking purposes.  Specifically, the LPSC proposes that System Energy’s common equity ratio be set to Entergy Corporation’s equity ratio of

37%

equity and

63%

debt.  In the alternative, the LPSC argues that the equity ratio should be no higher than

49%

, the composite equity ratio of System Energy and the other Entergy operating companies who purchase under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  The APSC and MPSC recommend that

35.98%

be set as the common equity ratio for System Energy.  As an alternative, the APSC and MPSC propose that System Energy’s common equity be set at

46.75%

based on the median equity ratio of the proxy group for setting the return on equity.

In September 2019 the FERC trial staff filed its rebuttal testimony in the return on equity proceeding.  For the first refund period, the FERC trial staff calculates an authorized return on equity for System Energy of

9.40%

based on the application of the FERC’s proposed methodology and an updated proxy group.  For the second refund period, based on the study period ending May 31, 2019, the FERC trial staff rebuttal testimony argues for a return on equity of

9.63%

.  In September 2019 the FERC trial staff also filed direct and answering testimony relating to System Energy’s capital structure.  The FERC trial staff argues that the average capital structure of the proxy group used to develop System Energy’s return on equity should be used to establish the capital structure. Using this approach, the FERC trial staff calculates the average capital structure for its proposed proxy group of

46.74%

common equity, and

53.26%

debt.

In October 2019, System Energy filed answering testimony disputing the FERC trial staff’s, the LPSC’s, and the APSC’s and MPSC’s arguments for the use of a hypothetical capital structure and arguing that the use of System Energy’s actual capital structure is just and reasonable.

In November 2019, in a proceeding that did not involve Entergy, the FERC issued an order addressing the methodology for determining the return on equity applicable to transmission owners in MISO.  Thereafter, the participants the System Energy proceeding agreed to amend the procedural schedule to allow the participants to file testimony addressing the order in the MISO transmission owner proceeding.  Under the new schedule, the hearing in the System Energy proceeding will commence in June 2020 and the initial decision will be due in October 2020.



System Energy Resources, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

Grand Gulf Sale-leaseback Renewal Complaint

In May 2018 the LPSC filed a complaint against System Energy and Entergy Services related to System Energy’s renewal of a sale-leaseback transaction originally entered into in December 1988 for an 11.5% undivided interest in Grand Gulf Unit 1.  The complaint alleges that System Energy violated the filed rate and the FERC’s ratemaking and accounting requirements when it included in Unit Power Sales Agreement billings the cost of capital additions associated with the sale-leaseback interest, and that System Energy is double-recovering costs by including both the lease payments and the capital additions in Unit Power Sales Agreement billings.  The complaint also claims that System Energy was imprudent in entering into the sale-leaseback renewal because the Utility operating companies that purchase Grand Gulf’s output from System Energy could have obtained cheaper capacity and energy in the MISO markets.  The complaint further alleges that System Energy violated various other reporting and accounting requirements and should have sought prior FERC approval of the lease renewal.  The complaint seeks various forms of relief from the FERC.  The complaint seeks refunds for capital addition costs for all years in which they were recorded in allegedly non-formula accounts or, alternatively, the disallowance of the return on equity for the capital additions in those years plus interest.  The complaint also asks that the FERC disallow and refund the lease costs of the sale-leaseback renewal on grounds of imprudence, investigate System Energy’s treatment of a DOE litigation payment, and impose certain forward-looking procedural protections, including audit rights for retail regulators of the Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rates.  The APSC, MPSC, and City Council intervened in the proceeding.

In June 2018, System Energy and Entergy Services filed a motion to dismiss and an answer to the LPSC complaint denying that System Energy’s treatment of the sale-leaseback renewal and capital additions violated the terms of the filed rate or any other FERC ratemaking, accounting, or legal requirements or otherwise constituted double recovery.  The response also argued that the complaint is inconsistent with a FERC-approved settlement to which the LPSC is a party and that explicitly authorizes System Energy to recover its lease payments.  Finally, the response argued that both the capital additions and the sale-leaseback renewal were prudent investments and the LPSC complaint fails to justify any disallowance or refunds.  The response also offered to submit formula rate protocols for the Unit Power Sales Agreement similar to the procedures used for reviewing transmission rates under the MISO tariff.  In September 2018 the FERC issued an order setting the complaint for hearing and settlement proceedings.  The FERC established a refund effective date of May 18, 2018.

In February 2019 the presiding ALJ ruled that the hearing ordered by the FERC includes the issue of whether specific subcategories of accumulated deferred income tax should be included in, or excluded from, System Energy’s formula rate.   In March 2019 the LPSC, MPSC, APSC and City Council filed direct testimony.  The LPSC testimony seeks refunds that include the renewal lease payments (approximately

$17.2 million

per year since July 2015), rate base reductions for accumulated deferred income tax associated with uncertain tax positions (claimed to be approximately

$334.5 million

as of December 2018), and the cost of capital additions associated with the sale-leaseback interest (claimed to be approximately

$274.8 million

), as well as interest on those amounts.  The direct testimony of the City Council and the APSC and MPSC address various issues raised by the LPSC.  System Energy disputes that any refunds are owed for billings under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.

In June 2019 System Energy filed answering testimony in the sale-leaseback complaint proceeding arguing that the FERC should reject all claims for refunds.  Among other things, System Energy argued that claims for refunds of the costs of lease renewal payments and capital additions should be rejected because those costs were recovered consistent with the Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rate, System Energy was not over or double recovering any costs, and ratepayers will save approximately

$850 million

over initial and renewal terms of the leases.  System Energy argued that claims for refunds associated with liabilities arising from uncertain tax positions should be rejected because the liabilities do not provide cost-free capital, the repayment timing of the liabilities is uncertain, and the outcome of the underlying tax positions is uncertain.  System Energy’s testimony also challenged the refund calculations supplied by the other parties.



System Energy Resources, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

In August 2019 the FERC trial staff filed direct and answering testimony seeking refunds for rate base reductions for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions (claimed to be up to approximately

$602 million

plus interest).  The FERC trial staff also argued that System Energy recovered

$32 million

more than it should have in depreciation expense for capital additions.  In September 2019, System Energy filed cross-answering testimony disputing the FERC trial staff’s arguments for refunds, stating that the FERC trial staff’s position regarding depreciation rates for capital additions is not unreasonable and explaining that any change in depreciation expense is only one element of a Unit Power Sales Agreement rebilling calculation.  Adjustments to depreciation expense in any rebilling under the Unit Power Sales Agreement formula rate will also involve changes to accumulated depreciation, accumulated deferred income taxes, and other formula elements as needed.  In October 2019 the LPSC filed rebuttal testimony increasing the amount of refunds sought for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.  The LPSC now seeks approximately

$512 million

plus interest.  At the same time, the FERC trial staff filed rebuttal testimony conceding that it was no longer seeking up to

$602 million

related to the uncertain tax positions; instead, it is seeking approximately $511 million plus interest.  The LPSC also argued that adjustments to depreciation rates should affect rate base on a prospective basis only.

A hearing was held before a FERC ALJ in November 2019 and the initial decision is due in April 2020.

Unit Power Sales Agreement

In August 2017, System Energy submitted to the FERC proposed amendments to the Unit Power Sales Agreement pursuant to which System Energy sells its Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.  The filing proposes limited amendments to the Unit Power Sales Agreement to adopt (1) updated rates for use in calculating Grand Gulf plant depreciation and amortization expenses and (2) updated nuclear decommissioning cost annual revenue requirements, both of which are recovered through the Unit Power Sales Agreement rate formula.  The amendments result in lower charges to the Utility operating companies that buy capacity and energy from System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  The changes were based on updated depreciation and nuclear decommissioning studies that take into account the renewal of Grand Gulf’s operating license for a term through November 1, 2044.

In September 2017 the FERC accepted System Energy’s proposed Unit Power Sales Agreement amendments, subject to further proceedings to consider the justness and reasonableness of the amendments.  Because the amendments propose a rate decrease, the FERC also initiated an investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to determine if the rate decrease should be lower than proposed.  The FERC accepted the proposed amendments effective October 1, 2017, subject to refund pending the outcome of the further settlement and/or hearing proceedings, and established a refund effective date of October 11, 2017 with respect to the rate decrease.  In June 2018, System Energy filed with the FERC an uncontested settlement relating to the updated depreciation rates and nuclear decommissioning cost annual revenue requirements.  In August 2018 the FERC issued an order accepting the settlement.  In the third quarter 2018, System Energy recorded a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately

$26 million

, representing the cumulative difference in depreciation expense resulting from the depreciation rates used from October 11, 2017 through September 30, 2018 and the depreciation rates included in the settlement filing accepted by the FERC.

Nuclear Matters

System Energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates Grand Gulf.  System Energy is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant.  These include risks related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements, both for capital investments and operational needs, to position Entergy’s nuclear fleet to meet its operational goals, including the financial requirements to address emerging issues like stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the plant systems and the Fukushima event; regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license renewal and amendments, and decommissioning; the performance and capacity factors of these nuclear plants; the availability of interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency



System Energy Resources, Inc.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis

of nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets and earnings to complete decommissioning of each site when required; and limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events such as a nuclear accident.   In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of Grand Gulf, System Energy may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.  Grand Gulf’s operating license expires in 2044.

Environmental Risks

System Energy’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes that System Energy is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in “

Regulation of Entergy’s Business

-

Environmental Regulation

” in Part I, Item 1.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of System Energy’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of System Energy’s financial position or results of operations.

demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.  See the “

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

” in the “

Critical Accounting Estimates

” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Cost Sensitivity

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.

Costs and Employer Contributions

Total qualified pension cost for System Energy in 2019 was $12.3 million.  System Energy anticipates 2020 qualified pension cost to be $17.6 million.  System Energy contributed $20.2 million to its qualified pension plans in 2019 and estimates 2020 pension contributions will approximate $10.5  million, although the 2020 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2020 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2020.

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for System Energy in 2019 was $1 million.  System Energy expects 2020 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income to approximate $1.3 million. System Energy contributed $829 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2019 and expects 2020 contributions to approximate $21 thousand.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Based on the evaluations, each PEO and PFO has concluded that, as to the Registrant or Registrants for which they serve as PEO or PFO, the Registrant’s or Registrants’ disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by each Registrant in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms; and that the Registrant’s or Registrants’ disclosure controls and procedures are also effective in reasonably assuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Registrant’s or Registrants’ management, including their respective PEOs and PFOs, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.



Internal Control over Financial Reporting

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

The managements of Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy (individually “Registrant” and collectively the “Registrants”) are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Registrants.  Each Registrant’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of each Registrant’s financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Each Registrant’s management assessed the effectiveness of each Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

.  In making this assessment, each Registrant’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework.  The 2013 COSO Framework was utilized for management’s assessment.

Based on each management’s assessment and the criteria set forth by the 2013 COSO Framework, each Registrant’s management believes that each Registrant maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

.

The report of Deloitte & Touche LLP, Entergy Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, regarding Entergy Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is included herein.  The report of Deloitte & Touche LLP is not applicable to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy because these Registrants are non-accelerated filers.

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

and found no change that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.



Attestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and Board of Directors of

Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 of the Corporation and our report dated February 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Item 9A, Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Executive Compensation Best Practices

:

2019 Executive Compensation Program Changes

During 2019, the following changes were made to Entergy Corporation’s executive officer compensation programs:

Annual Incentive Plan

In recognition of Entergy Corporation’s successful execution on its strategy to exit the Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant power business, Entergy Corporation decided to establish a new, single earnings measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) for guidance



and investor reporting purposes that would better reflect its ongoing business and respond to feedback received from investors on the earnings measures on which Entergy Corporation had previously reported and guided.  This new measure, Entergy Adjusted Earnings Per Share (“ETR Adjusted EPS”), adjusts the Company’s as reported (GAAP) earnings per share results to eliminate the impact of its Entergy Wholesale Commodities merchant power business, significant tax items and other non-routine items.   With this change in the external guidance measure, and given the Personnel Committee’s desire to maintain an appropriate degree of alignment between the Company’s externally communicated earnings targets and the targets under the annual incentive plan, the committee adopted new performance measures to determine the maximum funding level of the annual incentive plan with each performance measure weighted equally:

•

The earnings measure, ETR Tax Adjusted EPS, is based on the externally reported ETR Adjusted EPS, which is then adjusted to add back the effect of significant tax items, and to eliminate the effect of major storms, the resolution of certain unresolved regulatory litigation matters, changes in federal income tax law and unrealized gains or losses on equity securities (the “Pre-Determined Exclusions”).

•

The cash flow measure, ETR Adjusted Operating Cash Flow is calculated based on Entergy Corporation’s as-reported (GAAP) operating cash flow, adjusted to eliminate the effect of any Pre-Determined Exclusions.

Long-Term Incentives

In keeping with the change in Entergy Corporation’s external guidance measure, the committee also adopted a new earnings measure for use in measuring performance under the Long-Term Performance Unit Program.  In particular, the committee decided that, for the 2019-2021 the Long-Term Performance Unit Program period, the performance measures will be (1) cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS, adjusted to eliminate the effect of any Pre-Determined Exclusions; and (2) relative total shareholder return with relative total shareholder return weighted eighty percent and cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS accounting for the remaining twenty percent.

Short-Term and Long-Term Incentive Targets Tailored to Role

Beginning in 2019, the short and long-term incentive targets for officers who are members of Entergy Corporation’s Office of the Chief Executive are being determined based on job-specific market data for the officer’s role.  Previously, the targets were the average of the market data for the officers within a specific management level, without regard to the officer’s specific job functions.  The targets for the Named Executive Officers who are Presidents of the Utility operating companies continue to be determined based on the average of the market data for the officers within a specific management level, without regard to their specific job function.  Entergy Corporation believes that this change for the members of the Office of the Chief Executive will help assure that each officer’s incentive targets are market competitive with respect to the officer’s particular role.

2019 Incentive Pay Outcomes

Entergy Corporation believes the 2019 incentive pay outcomes for the Named Executive Officers demonstrated the application of Entergy Corporation’s pay for performance philosophy.

Annual Incentive Plan

Awards under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan, or Annual Incentive Plan, are tied to Entergy Corporation’s financial and operational performance through the Entergy Achievement Multiplier (“EAM”), which is the performance metric used to determine the maximum funding available for awards under the plan.  The 2019 EAM was determined based on the two equally weighted performance metrics discussed in the “2019 Executive Compensation Program Changes” section above.



2019 Annual Incentive Plan Payout

For 2019, the Personnel Committee, based on the recommendation of the Finance Committee, determined that management exceeded its ETR Tax Adjusted EPS goal of $5.30 per share by $1.23 per share and fell short of its ETR Adjusted Operating Cash Flow goal of $3.1 billion by approximately $134 million. Based on the targets and ranges previously established by the Personnel Committee, these results resulted in a calculated EAM of 139%.

Long-Term Performance Unit Program

Under the Long-Term Performance Unit Program, units are granted with performance measured over a three-year period based on Entergy Corporation’s total shareholder return in relation to the total shareholder return of the companies included in the Philadelphia Utility Index.  Payouts, if any, are based on Entergy Corporation’s performance on these measures against pre-established performance goals.

Long-Term Performance Unit Program Payout

For the three-year performance period ending in 2019, Entergy Corporation’s total shareholder return was in the top quartile of the companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index, yielding a payout of 200% of target for the Named Executive Officers.  Payouts were made in shares of Entergy Corporation stock which are required to be held by the executive officers until they satisfy the executive stock ownership guidelines.

What Entergy Corporation Pays and Why

Competitive Positioning

Market Data for Compensation Comparison

Annually, the Personnel Committee reviews:

•

Published and private compensation survey data compiled by Pay Governance, LLC (“Pay Governance”), the  Personnel Committee’s independent compensation consultant;

•

Both utility and general industry data to determine total cash compensation (base salary and annual incentive) for non-industry specific roles;

•

Data from utility companies to determine total cash compensation for management roles that are utility-specific, such as Group President, Utility Operations; and

•

Utility market data to determine long-term incentives for all positions.

How the Personnel Committee Uses the Market Data

The Personnel Committee uses this survey data to develop compensation opportunities that are designed to deliver total target compensation within a targeted range of approximately the 50

th

percentile of the surveyed companies in the aggregate. In most cases, the committee considers its objectives to have been met if Entergy Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and the eight other executive officers (including the applicable Named Executive Officers) who constitute the Office of the Chief Executive each has a target compensation opportunity that falls within a targeted range of 85% - 115% of the 50

th

percentile of the survey data.   In general, compensation levels for an executive officer who is new to a position tend to be at the lower end of the competitive range, while seasoned executive officers with strong performance who are viewed as critical to retain would be positioned at the higher end of the competitive range. Generally, differences in the levels of total direct compensation among the Named Executive Officers are primarily driven by the scope of their responsibilities, differences in the competitive market pay range for similar positions and considerations of internal pay equity.



Proxy Peer Group

Although the survey data described above are the primary data used in benchmarking compensation, the committee uses compensation information from the companies included in the Philadelphia Utility Index to evaluate the overall reasonableness of Entergy Corporation’s compensation programs and to determine relative total shareholder return for the 2017-2019 Long-Term Performance Unit Program awards. Companies included in the Philadelphia Utility Index at the time the proxy data was compiled were as follows:

Principal Executive Compensation Elements

The following table summarizes the elements of total direct compensation (“TDC”) granted or paid to the executive officers under the 2019 executive compensation programs. The programs use a mix of fixed and variable compensation elements and are designed to provide alignment with both short- and long-term business goals through annual and long-term incentives. An executive officer’s TDC is based primarily on corporate performance, market-based compensation levels and individual performance with each of these elements reviewed annually for each Named Executive Officer.



Fixed Compensation

Base Salary

The Personnel Committee determines the base salaries for all of the Named Executive Officers who are members of the Office of the Chief Executive based on competitive compensation data, performance considerations, and advice provided by the committee’s independent compensation consultant.  For the other Named Executive Officers, their salaries are established by their immediate supervisors using the same criteria.  The base salaries of the Named Executive Officers are considered annually as part of the performance review process, and upon a Named Executive Officer’s promotion or other change in job responsibilities.  In 2019, all of the Named Executive Officers, other than Mr. Denault, received merit increases in their base salaries ranging from approximately 2.5% to 4.5%.  In 2019, Mr. Denault did not receive a merit increase in his base salary.  Instead, the Personnel Committee increased Mr. Denault’s TDC by increasing his annual and long-term incentive target opportunities; thus, increasing the share of his compensation that is “at risk.”   The increases in base salary were based on the market data previously discussed in this CD&A under “What Entergy Corporation Pays and Why.”

The following table sets forth the 2018 and 2019 base salaries for the Named Executive Officers.  Changes in base salaries for 2019 were effective in April.

Variable Compensation

Short-Term Incentive Compensation

Annual Incentive Plan

Awards under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan, or Annual Incentive Plan, are tied to Entergy Corporation’s financial and operational performance through the EAM, which is the performance metric used to determine the maximum funding available for awards under the plan.  Entergy Corporation uses the following process to determine annual incentive awards:

•

Establish Performance Measures to Determine EAM Pool.

Annually, the Personnel Committee engages in a rigorous process to determine the performance measures used to determine the EAM.  The Personnel Committee’s goal is to establish measures that are consistent with Entergy Corporation’s strategy and business objectives for the upcoming year, as reflected in its financial plan, and are designed to drive results that represent a high level of achievement.  These measures are approved based on a comprehensive review by the full Board of Entergy Corporation’s financial plan, conducted in December of the preceding year and updated in January to reflect key drivers of anticipated changes in performance from the preceding year.



•

Establish Target Achievement Levels.

In January, after Entergy Corporation’s financial plan is updated to reflect any changes from that reviewed in December, the Personnel Committee establishes the specific targets that must be achieved for each performance measure.  The Personnel Committee also seeks to assure that the targets:

◦

Take into account changes in the business environment and specific challenges facing Entergy Corporation;

◦

Reflect an appropriate balancing of the various risks and opportunities recognized at the time the targets are set; and

◦

Are aligned with external expectations communicated to Entergy Corporation’s shareholders.

•

Establish Named Officer Target Opportunities.

In January of each year, the Personnel Committee establishes the target opportunities for the members of the Office of the Chief Executive based on its review of the competitive analysis of job-specific market data prepared by Pay Governance as well as the officer’s role, individual performance and internal equity considerations.  For the Named Executive Officers who are members of the Office of the Chief Executive (Messrs. Bakken, Brown, Denault, Marsh and West), target award opportunities are established based on these factors.  For the other Named Executive Officers, target award opportunities are determined based on their management level within the Entergy organization.  Executive management levels at Entergy Corporation range from ML level 1 through ML level 4 (the “ML 1-4 Officers”).  At December 31, 2019, Mr. May held a Level 3 position, and Mr. Ellis, Mr. Fisackerly, Ms. Landreaux and Ms. Rainer held Level 4 positions.  Accordingly, their respective incentive award opportunities differ from one another based on either their management level or the external market data developed by the Committee’s independent compensation consultant.  The 2019 target opportunities were increased for Mr. Denault, Mr. Marsh and Mr. Brown to align more closely with market data.  The target levels for the other Named Executive Officers are comparable to the levels set for 2018.

•

Determine the EAM.

After the end of the fiscal year, the Finance and Personnel Committees jointly review Entergy Corporation’s financial results and the Personnel Committee determines the EAM, which represents the level of success in achieving the performance objectives established by the committee and determines the maximum funding level of the annual incentive plan, as a percentage of the total target opportunity.

•

Determine Annual Incentive Awards.

To determine individual executive officer awards under the annual incentive plan, the Personnel Committee considers not only each executive’s role in executing on Entergy Corporation’s strategies and delivering the financial performance achieved, but also the individual’s accountability for any challenges the Company experienced during the year.

2019 Targets

Using the process described above, in December 2018, the Personnel Committee decided to use ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and ETR Adjusted Operating Cash Flow, with each measure weighted equally, as the performance measures for determining the 2019 EAM pool. ETR Tax Adjusted EPS is based on ETR Adjusted EPS, which is the primary earnings measure used by the Company externally and the measure on which it provides annual earnings guidance, which is then adjusted to add back the effect of any significant tax items that were excluded to arrive at ETR Adjusted EPS and to eliminate the effects, if any, of the Pre-Determined Exclusions.   ETR Adjusted Operating Cash Flow is calculated based on Entergy Corporation’s as-reported (GAAP) operating cash flow, adjusted to eliminate the effect of any Pre-Determined Exclusions.  The Personnel Committee determined that ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and ETR Adjusted Operating Cash Flow were the appropriate metrics to use for this purpose because:

•

They are based on objective financial measures that Entergy Corporation and its investors consider to be important in evaluating its financial performance;

•

They are based on the same metrics we use for internal and external financial reporting; and

They provide both discipline and transparency.



The Personnel Committee considered it appropriate to use ETR Tax Adjusted EPS, which adds back the effect of significant tax items that may have been excluded from ETR Adjusted EPS, as the earnings measure because of the significant benefits to Entergy Corporation resulting from such tax items and the management effort required to achieve them.  The Personnel Committee also considered the appropriateness of excluding the effect of each of the Pre-Determined Exclusions from each of the financial measures.  It viewed the exclusion of major storms as appropriate because although Entergy Corporation includes estimates for storm costs in its financial plan, it does not include estimates for a major storm event, such as a hurricane.  The Personnel Committee considered the exclusion of any unanticipated effects of the tax reform legislation adopted at the end of 2017 to be appropriate because of the lingering uncertainty around those effects and the inability of management to impact those results.  The Personnel Committee approved the other exclusions from reported results - for the impact of certain legacy unresolved regulatory litigation and unanticipated unrealized gains and losses on securities held by Entergy Corporation’s nuclear decommissioning trusts - primarily because of management’s inability to influence either of the related outcomes.

In determining the targets to set for 2019, the Personnel Committee reviewed anticipated drivers for consolidated operational earnings per share and consolidated operational operating cash flow for 2019 as set forth in Entergy Corporation’s financial plan, as well as factors driving the strong financial performance achieved in 2018.  The Personnel Committee confirmed that the proposed plan targets for ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and ETR Adjusted Operating Cash Flow reflected substantial growth in the core weather-adjusted utility earnings and consolidated operating cash flow measures underlying the annual incentive plan targets. The Personnel Committee also considered the potential impact of a wide range of identified risks and opportunities and confirmed that there appeared to be more downside risk than upside opportunity embedded in the financial plan targets and, as a result, the Personnel Committee believed that the related annual incentive plan targets reflected a reasonable degree of challenge.

2019 Performance Assessment

The following table shows the 2019 Incentive Plan targets established by the Personnel Committee and 2019 results:

Annual Incentive Plan Targets and Results

(1)

Payouts for performance between minimum and target achievement levels and between target and maximum achievement levels are calculated using straight-line interpolation.  There is no payout for performance below the minimum achievement level.

(2)

ETR Tax Adjusted Earnings Per Share is a different measure than the consolidated operational earnings per share, and ETR Adjusted Operating Cash Flow is a different measure than the consolidated operational operating cash flow used to determine the 2018 annual incentive awards.  As a result, the goals and results are not comparable year over year.

In January 2020, the Finance and Personnel Committees jointly reviewed Entergy Corporation’s financial results against the performance objectives reflected in the table above.  Management discussed with the committees Entergy Corporation’s ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and ETR Adjusted Operating Cash Flow results for 2019, including primary factors explaining how those results compared to the 2019 business plan and Annual Incentive Plan targets set in January 2019.  ETR Tax Adjusted EPS exceeded Entergy Corporation’s ETR Tax Adjusted EPS target of $5.30 per share by $1.23, but management fell short of achieving its ETR Adjusted Operating Cash Flow target of $3.1 billion by approximately $134 million, leading to a calculated EAM of 139%.  None of the Pre-Determined Exclusions resulted in any adjustment to ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and ETR Adjusted Operating Cash Flow.



In addition to the foregoing results, the Personnel Committee considered management’s degree of success in achieving various operational and regulatory goals set out at the beginning of the year and in overcoming certain challenges that arose in the business during the course of the year.  The Personnel Committee also considered (i) the Entergy Corporation’s degree of success in achieving its published earnings guidance, which it exceeded by $0.10 per share at the midpoint of the original guidance range for ETR Adjusted EPS provided at the beginning of the year and by $0.05 per share at the midpoint of the adjusted guidance range published in July 2019, and (ii) total shareholder return for 2019 in relation to the Philadelphia Utility Index, which placed Entergy Corporation in the top quartile of companies in the index with a total shareholder return of 44.3% for the year.  Finally, the committee reviewed the impact on ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and ETR Adjusted Operating Cash Flow of significant tax items that were included in the results and additional pension contributions made during the year beyond those that were required or included in the initial 2019 financial plan.  Following this review, the Personnel Committee decided to approve the EAM as calculated in accordance with the plan design.

To determine individual executive officer awards under the Annual Incentive Plan for the Named Executive Officers who are members of the Office of the Chief Executive, the Personnel Committee considered not only each executive’s role in executing on Entergy Corporation’s strategies and delivering the strong financial performance achieved in 2018, but also the individual’s accountability for certain operational and regulatory challenges it experienced during the year.  With these considerations in mind, the committee exercised negative discretion to determine individual awards that ranged from 135% to 137% of target for each of the Named Executive Officers who are members of the Office of the Chief Executive, with the extent of the negative discretion applied varying based on the executive’s specific accountabilities and accomplishments.

After the EAM was established to determine overall funding for the Annual Incentive Plan, Entergy Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer allocated incentive award funding to individual business units based on business unit results.  Individual awards were determined for the remaining Named Executive Officers who are not members of the Office of the Chief Executive by their immediate supervisor based on the individual officer’s key accountabilities, accomplishments, and performance.  This resulted in payouts that ranged from 127% of target to 208% of target for the Named Executive Officers who are not members of the Office of the Chief Executive.

Based on the foregoing evaluation of management performance, the Named Executive Officers received the following Annual Incentive Plan payouts for 2019:

Long-Term Incentive Compensation

Long-term incentive compensation, consisting solely of equity awards in 2019, represents the largest portion of the Named Executive Officers’ compensation.  Entergy Corporation’s believes the combination of long-term incentives we employ acts in retaining the senior management team, and aligns the interests of the executive officers



with the interests of Entergy Corporation’s shareholders and customers by enhancing executives’ focus on the Company’s long-term goals.  In general, Entergy Corporation seeks to allocate the total value of long-term incentive compensation 60% to performance units and 40% to a combination of stock options and restricted stock, equally divided in value, based on the value the compensation model seeks to deliver.  Awards for individual Named Executive Officers may vary from this target as a result of individual performance, promotions, and internal pay equity.

2019 Long-Term Incentive Award Mix

Beginning in 2019, a dollar value was established for the target long-term incentive awards for each Named Executive Officer who is a member of the Office of the Chief Executive.  The targeted award value for these officers was determined based on market median compensation data for the officer’s role, adjusted to reflect individual performance and internal equity.  Previously, the targets for these Named Executive Officers were the average of the market data for the officers within a specific management level, without regard to the officer’s specific job functions.  In January 2019, the Personnel Committee approved the 2019 long-term incentive award target values for the Named Executive Officers who are members of the Office of the Chief Executive.  This value was then converted into the number of performance units, stock options and shares of restricted stock granted using the allocation described above based on the target grant date value.

In consultation with Entergy Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer, the Personnel Committee reviews each of the other Named Executive Officer’s performance, role and responsibilities, strengths, developmental opportunities and internal equity and allocates awards of restricted stock and stock options to each of these officers based on these factors. Grants of long-term performance units for these Named Executive Officers was determined based on the average of the market data for the officers within a specific management level, without regard to the officer’s specific job function.

Performance Unit Program

The Named Executive Officers are issued performance unit awards under the Long-Term Performance Unit Program.

•

Each performance unit represents one share of Entergy Corporation’s common stock at the end of the three-year performance period, plus dividends accrued during the performance period.

•

The performance units and accrued dividends on any shares earned during the performance period are settled in shares of Entergy Corporation common stock.

•

The Personnel Committee sets payout opportunities for the program at the outset of each performance period, with payouts only occurring if the performance goals are met.

•

Payouts under this program will not be made for the 2019-2021 performance period if total shareholder return falls within the lowest quartile of the peer companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index and Cumulative Entergy Adjusted EPS is below the minimum performance goal.

•

All shares paid out under the Long-Term Performance Unit Program are required to be retained by Entergy Corporation’s officers until applicable executive stock ownership requirements are met.

The Long-Term Performance Unit Program specifies a minimum, target and maximum achievement level, the achievement of which will determine the number of performance units that may be earned by each participant. For the 2019 - 2021 performance period, the Personnel Committee chose the performance measures and targets set forth below.

Given the economic and market conditions at the time the targets were set, the target payout level for the Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS goal was designed to be challenging, but achievable while payout at the maximum levels was designed to require stretch performance.



2019-2021 Long-Term Performance Unit Performance Period Measures and Goals

(1)

Payouts for performance between achievement levels are calculated using straight-line interpolation, with no payouts for performance below the minimum achievement level for both performance measures.

Performance Measures

Total Shareholder Return

•

The Personnel Committee chose relative total shareholder return as a performance measure because it reflects Entergy Corporation’s creation of shareholder value relative to other electric utilities included in the Philadelphia Utility Index over the performance period.  By measuring performance in relation to an industry benchmark, this measure is intended to isolate and reward management for the creation of shareholder value that is not driven by events that affect the industry as a whole.

•

Minimum, target and maximum performance levels are determined by reference to the ranking of Entergy Corporation’s total shareholder return in relation to the TSR of the companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index. The Personnel Committee identified the Philadelphia Utility Index as the appropriate industry peer group for determining relative total shareholder return because the companies included in this index, in the aggregate, are deemed to be comparable to the Company in terms of business and scale.

Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS

•

Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS, which adjusts Entergy Corporation’s as reported (GAAP) results to eliminate the impact of earnings or loss from Entergy Wholesale Commodities and other non-routine items, was selected in 2019 as a performance measure because the Personnel Committee wished to incentivize management to achieve steady, predictable earnings growth for the Company over the 3 year performance period, and because it aligns with the earnings measure used to communicate the Company’s earnings expectations externally to investors.

•

In a manner similar to the way targets are established for the annual incentives, targets for the Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS performance measure were established by the Personnel Committee after the Entergy Corporation Board’s review of Entergy’s financial plan for the three-year period beginning in 2019 and are consistent with the earnings expectations for the Company that are communicated to investors. These targets also incorporate the Pre-Determined Exclusions discussed previously with respect to the annual incentive measures.

Stock Options and Restricted Stock

Entergy Corporation grants stock options and shares of restricted stock because they align the interests of the executive officers with long-term shareholder value, provide competitive compensation, and increase the executives’ ownership in Entergy Corporation common stock.  Generally, stock options are granted with a maximum term of ten years, and vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant.  The exercise price for each option granted in 2019 was $89.19, which was the closing price of Entergy’s common stock on the date of grant.  Shares of restricted stock vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, are paid dividends which are



reinvested in shares of Entergy stock and have the ability to vote.  The dividend reinvestment shares are subject to forfeiture similar to the terms of the original grant.

2019 Long-Term Incentive Awards

In January 2019, the Personnel Committee granted the following long-term performance units, stock options and shares of restricted stock to each Named Executive Officer. The number of long-term performance units, stock options and shares of restricted stock were determined as discussed above under “Long-Term Incentive Compensation - 2019 Long-Term Incentive Award Mix.”

All of the outstanding performance units and all of the shares of restricted stock and stock options granted to the Named Executive Officers in 2019 were granted pursuant to the 2015 Equity Ownership Plan or 2015 Equity Plan. The 2015 Equity Plan requires both a change in control and an involuntary job loss or substantial diminution of duties (a “double trigger”) for the acceleration of these awards upon a change in control.

2019 Long-Term Performance Unit Program Payouts

Payout for the 2017-2019 Long-Term Performance Unit Program Period

. For the 2017-2019 three-year performance period, the Personnel Committee chose relative total shareholder return as the performance measure with the payout subject to achievement of the following:

Payouts for performance between achievement levels are calculated using straight-line interpolation, with no payouts for performance below the minimum achievement level.

In January 2020, the Personnel Committee reviewed the Company’s total shareholder return for the 2017 - 2019 performance period in order to determine the payout to participants. The committee compared Entergy Corporation’s total shareholder return against the total shareholder return of the companies that comprise the Philadelphia Utility Index, with the performance measures and range of potential payouts for the 2017 - 2019 performance period as provided above. As recommended by the Finance Committee, the Personnel Committee



concluded that the Company’s relative total shareholder return for the 2017 - 2019 performance period was in the top quartile, yielding a payout of 200% of target for the Named Executive Officers.

Benefits and Perquisites

Entergy Corporation’s Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in or receive the following benefits:

Entergy Corporation provides these benefits to the Named Executive Officers as part of its effort to provide a competitive executive compensation program and because it believes that these benefits are important retention and recruitment tools since many of the companies with which it competes for executive talent provide similar arrangements to their senior executive officers.



Severance and Other Compensation Arrangements

The Personnel Committee believes that retention and transitional compensation arrangements are an important part of overall compensation as they help to secure the continued employment and dedication of the Named Executive Officers, notwithstanding any concern that they might have at the time of a change in control regarding their own continued employment.  In addition, the Personnel Committee believes that these arrangements are important as recruitment and retention devices, as many of the companies with which Entergy Corporation competes for executive talent have similar arrangements in place for their senior employees.

To achieve these objectives, Entergy Corporation has established a System Executive Continuity Plan under which ML 1-4 Officers are entitled to receive “change in control” payments and benefits if such officer’s employment is involuntarily terminated in connection with a change in control of Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation strives to ensure that the benefits and payment levels under the System Executive Continuity Plan are consistent with market practices.  Entergy Corporation’s executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, are not entitled to any tax gross up payments on any severance benefits received under this plan.  For more information regarding the System Executive Continuity Plan, see “2019 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control.”

In certain cases, the Personnel Committee may approve the execution of a retention agreement with an individual executive officer.  These decisions are made on a case by case basis to reflect specific retention needs or other factors, including market practice.  If a retention agreement is entered into with an individual officer, the committee considers the economic value associated with that agreement in making overall compensation decisions for that officer.

Mr. Ellis

In connection with the commencement of his employment as President, Entergy New Orleans, Mr. Ellis was eligible for certain relocation benefits pursuant to Entergy Corporation’s Relocation Assistance Policy, including assistance with moving expenses, transportation of household goods and assistance with the sale of his home.  Mr. Ellis also received a sign-on bonus of $200,000 when he assumed this role.  Mr. Ellis’s sign-on bonus and certain of his relocation benefits are subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances if Mr. Ellis’s employment is terminated within 24 months of the commencement of his employment.  Also, in accordance with the terms of the Long-Term Performance Unit Program in January 2019, Mr. Ellis received pro-rated target award opportunities for the 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 performance periods.

Nuclear Retention Plan

Mr. Bakken participates in the Nuclear Retention Plan, a retention plan for officers and other leaders with expertise in the nuclear industry.  The Personnel Committee authorized this plan to attract and retain key management and employee talent in the nuclear power field, a field that requires unique technical and other expertise that is in great demand in the utility industry.  The plan provides for bonuses to be paid annually over a three-year service period with the bonus opportunity dependent on the participant’s management level and continued employment.  Each annual payment is equal to an amount ranging from 15% to 30% of the employee’s base salary as of their date of enrollment in the plan.  Mr. Bakken’s participation in the plan commenced in May 2016, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plan, in May 2017, 2018 and 2019, Mr. Bakken received a cash bonus equal to $181,500 or 30% of his May 1, 2016 base salary.   This plan does not provide for accelerated or prorated payout upon termination of any kind.

Compensation Policies and Practices

Entergy Corporation strives to ensure that its compensation philosophy and practices are in line with the best practices of companies in its industry as well as other companies in the S&P 500.  Some of these practices include the following:



Clawback Provisions

Entergy Corporation has adopted a clawback policy that covers all individuals subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including the members of the Office of the Chief Executive. Under the policy, which goes beyond the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley), the Personnel Committee will require reimbursement of incentives paid to these executive officers where:

•

(i) the payment was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results with respect to the applicable performance period that were subsequently determined to be the subject of a material restatement other than a restatement due to changes in accounting policy; or (ii) a material miscalculation of a performance award occurs, whether or not the financial statements were restated and, in either such case, a lower payment would have been made to the executive officer based upon the restated financial results or correct calculation; or

•

in the Board of Directors’ view, the executive officer engaged in fraud that caused or partially caused the need for a restatement or caused a material miscalculation of a performance award, in each case, whether or not the financial statements were restated.

The amount the Personnel Committee requires to be reimbursed is equal to the excess of the gross incentive payment made over the gross payment that would have been made if the original payment had been determined based on the restated financial results or correct calculation.  Further, following a material restatement of Entergy Corporation’s financial statements, Entergy Corporation will seek to recover any compensation received by Entergy Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that is required to be reimbursed under Sarbanes-Oxley.

Stock Ownership Guidelines and Share Retention Requirements

For many years, Entergy Corporation has had stock ownership guidelines for executives, including the Named Executive Officers.  These guidelines are designed to align the executives’ long-term financial interests with the interests of Entergy Corporation’s shareholders.  Annually, the Personnel Committee monitors the executive officers’ compliance with these guidelines.

The ownership guidelines are as follows:

Further, to facilitate compliance with the guidelines, until an executive officer satisfies the stock ownership guidelines, the officer must retain:

•

all net after-tax shares paid out under the Long-Term Performance Unit Program;

•

all net after-tax shares of the restricted stock and restricted stock units received upon vesting; and

•

at least 75% of the after-tax net shares received upon the exercise of Entergy Corporation stock options.

Trading Controls

Executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, are required to receive permission from Entergy Corporation’s General Counsel or his designee prior to entering into any transaction involving Entergy Corporation securities, including gifts, other than the exercise of employee stock options.  Trading is generally permitted only during specified open trading windows beginning shortly after the release of earnings.  Employees, who are subject to trading restrictions, including the Named Executive Officers, may enter into trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, but these trading plans may be entered into only during an open trading window and must be approved by Entergy Corporation.  The Named Executive Officer bears full responsibility if he or she violates Entergy Corporation’s policy by buying or selling shares of Entergy Corporation stock without pre-approval or when trading is restricted.



Entergy Corporation also prohibits directors and executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, from pledging any Entergy Corporation securities or entering into margin accounts involving Entergy Corporation securities. Entergy Corporation prohibits these transactions because of the potential that sales of Entergy Corporation securities could occur outside trading periods and without the required approval of the General Counsel.

Entergy Corporation also has adopted an anti-hedging policy that prohibits officers, directors, and employees from entering into hedging or monetization transactions involving Entergy Corporation’s common stock. Prohibited transactions include, without limitation, zero-cost collars, forward sale contracts, purchase or sale of options, puts, calls, straddles or equity swaps or other derivatives that are directly linked to Entergy Corporation’s stock or transactions involving “short-sales” of its common stock.  The Board adopted this policy to require officers, directors, and employees to continue to own Entergy Corporation stock with the full risks and rewards of ownership, thereby ensuring continued alignment of their objectives with those of Entergy Corporation’s other shareholders.

How Entergy Corporation Makes Compensation Decisions

The Personnel Committee oversees Entergy Corporation’s executive compensation programs and policies with the advice of its independent compensation consultant and support from its management team.



Compensation Consultant Independence

To maintain the independence of the Personnel Committee’s compensation consultant, the Board has adopted a policy that any consultant (including its affiliates) retained by the Board of Directors or any committee of the Board of Directors to provide advice or recommendations on the amount or form of executive or director compensation should not be retained by Entergy Corporation or any of its affiliates to provide other services in an aggregate amount that exceeds $120,000 in any year.  Pay Governance, which serves as the Personnel Committee’s compensation consultant, did not provide any services to management in 2019.



Annually, the Personnel Committee reviews the relationship with its compensation consultant, including services provided, quality of those services, and fees associated with services in its evaluation of the compensation consultant’s independence. The committee also assesses Pay Governance’s independence under NYSE rules and has concluded that no conflicts of interest exist that would prevent Pay Governance from independently advising the Personnel Committee.

PERSONNEL COMMITTEE REPORT

The Personnel Committee Report included in the Entergy Corporation Proxy Statement is incorporated by reference, but will not be deemed to be “filed” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  None of the Registrant Subsidiaries has a compensation committee or other board committee performing equivalent functions.  The board of directors of each of the Registrant Subsidiaries is comprised of individuals who are officers or employees of Entergy Corporation or one of the Registrant Subsidiaries.  These boards do not make determinations regarding the compensation paid to executive officers of the Registrant Subsidiaries.



EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES

2019 Summary Compensation Tables

The following table summarizes the total compensation paid or earned by each of the Named Executive Officers for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and to the extent required by SEC executive compensation disclosure rules, the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.  For information on the principal positions held by each of the Named Executive Officers, see Item 10, “Directors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance of the Registrants.”

The compensation set forth in the table represents the aggregate compensation paid by all Entergy System companies.  For additional information regarding the material terms of the awards reported in the following tables, including a general description of the formula or criteria to be applied in determining the amounts payable, see “Compensation Discussion and Analysis.”



(1)

Mr. Ellis was named Chief Executive Officer, Entergy New Orleans in December 2018, and Ms. Landreaux was named Chief Executive Officer, Entergy Arkansas in July 2018.

(2)

The amounts in column (c) represent the actual base salary paid to the Named Executive Officers in the applicable year.  The 2019 changes in base salaries noted in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis were effective in April 2019.

(3)

The amount in column (d) in 2019, 2018 and 2017 for Mr. Bakken represents the cash bonus paid to him pursuant to the Nuclear Retention Plan.  See “Nuclear Retention Plan” in Compensation Discussion and Analysis.  The amount in column (d) in 2018 for Mr. Ellis represents a cash sign-on bonus paid in connection with his commencement of employment with Entergy New Orleans.

(4)

The amounts in column (e) represent the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock and performance units granted under the 2015 Equity Plan, each calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, without taking into account estimated forfeitures.  The grant date fair value of the restricted stock is based on the closing price of Entergy Corporation common stock on the date of grant.  The grant date fair value of the portion of the performance units with vesting based on the total shareholder return was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model.  The simulation model applies a risk-free interest rate and an expected volatility assumption.  The risk-free interest rate is assumed to equal the yield on a three-year treasury bond on the grant date.  Volatility is based on historical volatility for the 36-month period preceding the grant date.  The performance units in the table are also valued based on the probable outcome of the applicable performance condition at the time of grant.  The maximum value of shares that will be received if the highest achievement level is attained with respect to both the total shareholder return and Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS, for performance units granted in 2019 are as follows:  Mr. Bakken, $1,953,212; Mr. Brown, $1,915,446; Mr. Denault, $8,269,303; Mr. Ellis, $296,003; Mr.



Fisackerly, $296,003; Ms. Landreaux $296,003; Mr. Marsh, $2,422,938; Mr. May, $438,901; Ms. Rainer, $296,003; and Mr. West, $2,056,302.

(5)

The amounts in column (f) represent the aggregate grant date fair value of stock options granted under the 2015 Equity Plan calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.  For a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in valuing these awards, see Note 12 to the financial statements.

(6)

The amounts in column (g) represent cash payments made under the Annual Incentive Plan.

(7)

For all Named Executive Officers, the amounts in column (h) include the annual actuarial increase in the present value of these Named Executive Officers’ benefits under all pension plans established by Entergy Corporation using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in Entergy Corporation’s financial statements and include amounts which the Named Executive Officers may not currently be entitled to receive because such amounts are not vested (see “2019 Pension Benefits”).  The increase in pension benefits for all of the Named Executive Officers in 2019 was driven by a decline in the discount rate that was a result of the decrease in prevailing interest rates.  None of the increases for any of the Named Executive Officers is attributable to above-market or preferential earnings on non-qualified deferred compensation.  For 2018, the aggregate change in the actuarial present value was a decrease of pension benefits of $52,000 for Mr. Fisackerly, $163,000 for Mr. Marsh, $700 for Mr. May, $110,700 for Ms. Rainer, and $149,300 for Mr. West.

(8)

The amounts in column (i) for 2019 include (a) matching contributions by Entergy Corporation under the Savings Plan to each of the Named Executive Officers; (b) dividends paid on restricted stock when vested; (c) life insurance premiums; (d) tax gross up payments on club dues and relocation expenses; and (e) perquisites and other compensation as described further below.  The amounts are listed in the following table:

Perquisites and Other Compensation

The amounts set forth in column (i) also include perquisites and other personal benefits that Entergy Corporation provides to its Named Executive Officers as part of providing a competitive executive compensation programs and for employee retention.  The following perquisites were provided to the Named Executive Officers in 2019.



For security and business reasons, Entergy Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer is permitted to use its corporate aircraft for personal use at the expense of Entergy Corporation.  The other Named Executive Officers may use the corporate aircraft for personal travel subject to the approval of Entergy Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer.  The Personnel Committee reviews the level of usage throughout the year.  Entergy Corporation believes that its officers’ ability to use its plane for limited personal use saves time and provides additional security for them, thereby benefiting Entergy Corporation.  The amounts included in column (i) for the personal use of corporate aircraft, reflect the incremental cost to Entergy Corporation for use of the corporate aircraft, determined on the basis of the variable operational costs of each flight, including fuel, maintenance, flight crew travel expense, catering, communications, and fees, including flight planning, ground handling, and landing permits.  The aggregate incremental aircraft usage cost associated with Mr. Denault’s personal use of the corporate aircraft was $56,108 for fiscal year 2019.  In addition, Entergy Corporation offers its executives comprehensive annual physical exams at Entergy Corporation’s expense.  Tickets to cultural and sporting events are purchased for business purposes, and if not utilized for business purposes, the tickets are made available to the employees, including the Named Executive Officers, for personal use.  None of the other perquisites referenced above exceeded $25,000 for any of the other Named Executive Officers.



2019 Grants of Plan-Based Awards

The following table summarizes award grants during 2019 to the Named Executive Officers.



(1)

The amounts in columns (c), (d), and (e) represent minimum, target, and maximum payment levels under the Annual Incentive Plan.  The actual amounts awarded are reported in column (g) of the Summary Compensation Table.

(2)

The amounts in columns (f), (g), and (h) represent the minimum, target, and maximum payment levels under the Long-Term Performance Unit Program.  Performance under the program is measured by Entergy Corporation’s total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder returns of the companies included in the Philadelphia Utility Index and Cumulative Entergy Adjusted EPS with total shareholder return weighted eighty percent and Cumulative Entergy Adjusted EPS weighted twenty percent. There is no payout under the program if Entergy Corporation’s total shareholder return falls within the lowest quartile of the peer companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index and Cumulative Entergy Adjusted EPS is below the minimum performance goal.  Subject to the achievement of performance targets, each unit will be converted into one share of Entergy Corporation’s common stock on the last day of the performance period (December 31, 2021.)  Accrued dividends on the shares earned will also be paid in Entergy Corporation common stock.

(3)

The amounts in column (i) represent shares of restricted stock granted under the 2015 Equity Plan.  Shares of restricted stock vest one-third on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date, have voting rights, and accrue dividends during the vesting period.

(4)

The amounts in column (j) represent options to purchase shares of Entergy Corporation’s common stock.  The options vest one-third on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date and have a ten-year term from the date of grant.  The options were granted under the 2015 Equity Plan.

(5)

The amounts in column (l) are valued based on the aggregate grant date fair value of the award calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 and, in the case of the performance units, are based on the probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions.  See Notes 4 and 5 to the 2019 Summary Compensation Table for a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair value.



2019 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End

The following table summarizes, for each Named Executive Officer, unexercised options, restricted stock that has not vested, and equity incentive plan awards outstanding as of December 31, 2019.







(1)

2019 Pension Benefits

The following table shows the present value as of December 31, 2019, of accumulated benefits payable to each of the Named Executive Officers, including the number of years of service credited to each Named Executive Officer, under the retirement plans sponsored by Entergy Corporation, determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions set forth in Note 11 to the financial statements.  Additional information regarding these retirement plans follows this table.

(1)

As of December 31, 2019, Mr. Brown, Mr. Denault, Mr. May, and Ms. Rainer were retirement eligible.

(2)

In 2006, Mr. Denault entered into a retention agreement granting him an additional 15 years of service and permission to retire under the non-qualified System Executive Retirement Plan in the event his employment is terminated by his Entergy employer other than for cause (as defined in the retention agreement), by Mr. Denault for good reason (as defined in the retention agreement), or on account of his death or disability.  His retention agreement also provides that if he terminates employment for any other reason, he shall be entitled to the additional 15 years of service under the non-qualified System Executive Retirement Plan only if his Entergy employer grants him permission to retire.  The additional 15 years of service increases the present value of his benefit by $3,887,900.

(3)

Service under the non-qualified System Executive Retirement Plan is granted from the date of hire.  Service under the qualified Entergy Retirement Plan is granted from the later of the date of hire or the plan participation date.



Retirement Benefits

The tables below contain summaries of the pension benefit plans sponsored by Entergy Corporation that the Named Executive Officers participated in during 2019.  Benefits for the Named Executive Officers who participate in these plans are determined using the same formulas as for other eligible employees.

Qualified Retirement Benefits



Benefit Timing

Normal retirement age under the plan is 65.

A reduced terminated vested benefit may be commenced as early as age 55. The amount of this benefit is determined by reducing the normal retirement benefit by 7% per year for the first 5 years commencement precedes age 65, and 6% per year for each additional year commencement precedes age 65.

A subsidized early retirement benefit may be commenced by employees who are at least age 55 with 10 years of service at the time they separate from service. The amount of this benefit is determined by reducing the normal retirement benefit by 2% per year for each year that early retirement precedes age 65.

Normal retirement age under the plan is 65.

A vested cash balance benefit can be commenced as early as the first day of the month following separation from service.  The amount of the benefit is determined in the same manner as the normal retirement benefit described above in the “Retirement Benefit Formula” section.

Non-qualified Retirement Benefits

The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in certain non-qualified retirement benefit plans that provide retirement income, including the Pension Equalization Plan, the Cash Balance Equalization Plan, and the System Executive Retirement Plan. Each of these plans is an unfunded non-qualified defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits to key management employees.  In these plans, as described below, an executive may participate in one or more non-qualified plans, but is only paid the amount due under the plan that provides the highest benefit.  In general, upon disability, participants in the Pension Equalization Plan and the System Executive Retirement Plan remain eligible for continued service credits until the earlier of recovery, separation from service due to disability, or retirement eligibility. Generally, spouses of participants who die before commencement of benefits may be eligible for a portion of the participant’s accrued benefit.





Additional Information

(1)

Effective July 1, 2014, (a) no new grants of supplemental service may be provided to participants in the Pension Equalization Plan; (b) supplemental credited service granted prior to July 1, 2014 was grandfathered; and (c) participants in Entergy Corporation’s Cash Balance Plan are not eligible to participate in the Pension Equalization Plan and instead may be eligible to participate in the Cash Balance Equalization Plan.

(2)

Benefits accrued under the System Executive Retirement Plan, Pension Equalization Plan, and Cash Balance Equalization Plan, if any, will become fully vested if a participant is involuntarily terminated without cause or terminates his or her employment for good reason in connection with a change in control with payment generally made in a lump-sum payment as soon as reasonably practicable following the first day of the month after the termination of employment, unless delayed 6 months under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.

(3)

The System Executive Retirement Plan was closed to new executive officers effective July 1, 2014.

2019 Non-qualified Deferred Compensation

As of  December 31, 2019, Mr. May had a deferred account balance under a frozen Defined Contribution Restoration Plan.  The amount is deemed invested, as chosen by Mr. May, in certain T. Rowe Price investment funds that are also available to the participant under the Savings Plan.  Mr. May has elected to receive the deferred account balance after he retires.  The Defined Contribution Restoration Plan, until it was frozen in 2005, credited eligible employees’ deferral accounts with employer contributions to the extent contributions under the qualified savings plan in which the employee participated were subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.

2019 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control

Entergy Corporation has plans and other arrangements that provide compensation to a Named Executive Officer if his or her employment terminates under specified conditions, including following a change in control of Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries.

Change in Control

Under Entergy Corporation’s System Executive Continuity Plan (the “Continuity Plan”), ML 1-4 Officers are eligible to receive the severance benefits described below if their employment is terminated by their Entergy System employer other than for cause or if they terminate their employment for good reason during a period beginning with a potential change in control and ending 24 months following the effective date of a change in control (a “Qualifying Termination”).  A participant will not be eligible for benefits under the Continuity Plan if such participant: accepts employment with Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; elects to receive the benefits of another severance or separation program; removes, copies or fails to return any property belonging to Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or violates his or her non-compete provision (which generally runs for two years but extends to three years if permissible under applicable law).   Entergy Corporation does not have any plans or agreements that provide for payments or benefits to any of the Named Executive Officers solely upon a change in control.



In the event of a Qualifying Termination, executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, generally will receive the benefits set forth below:

*

Cash severance payments are capped at 2.99 times the sum of (a) an executive’s annual base salary plus (b) the higher of his or her actual annual incentive payment under the Annual Incentive Plan or his or her annual incentive, calculated using the average annual target opportunity derived under the Annual Incentive Plan for the two calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which termination occurs.  Any cash severance payments to be paid under the Continuity Plan in excess of this cap will be forfeited by the participant.

To protect shareholders and Entergy Corporation’s business model, executives are required to comply with non-compete, non-solicitation, confidentiality and non-denigration provisions.   If an executive discloses non-public data or information concerning Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or violates his or her non-compete provision, he or she will be required to repay any benefits previously received under the Continuity Plan.

For purposes of the Continuity Plan the following events are generally defined as:

•

Change in Control

: (a) the purchase of 30% or more of either Entergy Corporation’s common stock or the combined voting power of Entergy Corporation’s voting securities; (b) the merger or consolidation of Entergy Corporation (unless its Board members constitute at least a majority of the board members of the surviving entity); (c) the liquidation, dissolution or sale of all or substantially all of Entergy Corporation’s assets; or (d) a change in the composition of Entergy Corporation’s Board such that, during any two-year period, the individuals serving at the beginning of the period no longer constitute a majority of Entergy Corporation’s Board at the end of the period.

•

Potential Change in Control

: (a) Entergy Corporation or an affiliate enters into an agreement the consummation of which would constitute a Change in Control; (b) the Entergy Corporation Board adopts resolutions determining that, for purposes of the Continuity Plan, a potential Change in Control has occurred; (c) a System Company or other person or entity publicly announces an intention to take actions that would constitute a Change in Control; or (d) any person or entity becomes the beneficial owner (directly or indirectly) of Entergy Corporation’s outstanding shares of common stock constituting 20% or more of the voting power or value of the Entergy Corporation’s outstanding common stock.



•

Cause:

The participant’s (a) willful and continuous failure to perform substantially his or her  duties after written demand for performance; (b) engagement in conduct that is materially injurious to Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; (c) conviction or guilty or nolo contendere plea to a felony or other crime that materially and adversely affects either his or her ability to perform his or her duties or Entergy Corporation’s reputation;  (d) material violation of any agreement with Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; or (e) disclosure of any of Entergy Corporation’s confidential information without authorization.

•

Good Reason

: The participant’s (a) nature or status of duties and responsibilities is substantially altered or reduced; (b) salary is reduced by 5% or more; (c) primary work location is relocated outside the continental United States; (d) compensation plans are discontinued without an equitable replacement; (e) benefits or number of vacation days are substantially reduced; or (f) employment is terminated by an Entergy employer for reasons other than in accordance with the Continuity Plan.

Other Termination Events

For termination events, other than in connection with a Change in Control, the executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, generally will receive the benefits set forth below:

*

If an officer resigns after the completion of an annual incentive plan, he or she may receive, at the Company’s discretion, an annual incentive payment.

**

If an officer resigns after the completion of a Long-Term Performance Unit Program performance period, he or she may receive a payout under the Long-Term Performance Unit Program based on the outcome of the performance period.



Mr. Denault’s 2006 Retention Agreement

In 2006, Entergy Corporation entered into a retention agreement with Mr. Denault that provides benefits to him in addition to, or in lieu of, the benefits described above.  Specifically, in the event of a Termination Event (as defined in his agreement):  1) Mr. Denault is entitled to a Target LTIP Award calculated by using the average annual number of performance units with respect to the two most recent performance periods preceding the calendar year in which his employment termination occurs, assuming all performance goals were achieved at target; and 2) all of Mr. Denault’s unvested stock options and shares of restricted stock will immediately vest.

In the event of death or disability, Mr. Denault would receive the greater of the Target LTIP Award calculated as described above or the pro-rated number of performance units for all open performance periods, based on the number of months of his participation in each open performance period.

Under the terms of his 2006 retention agreement, Mr. Denault’s employment may be terminated for cause upon Mr. Denault’s:  (a) continuing failure to substantially perform his duties (other than because of physical or mental illness or after he has given notice of termination for good reason) that remains uncured for 30 days after receiving a written notice from the Personnel Committee; (b) willfully engaging in conduct that is demonstrably and materially injurious to Entergy; (c) conviction of or entrance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or other crime that has or may have a material adverse effect on his ability to carry out his duties or upon Entergy’s reputation; (d) material violation of any agreement that he has entered into with Entergy; or (e) unauthorized disclosure of Entergy’s confidential information.

Mr. Denault may terminate his employment for good reason upon: (a) the substantial reduction in the nature or status of his duties or responsibilities from those in effect immediately prior to the date of the retention agreement, other than de minimis acts that are remedied after notice from Mr. Denault; (b) a reduction of 5% or more in his base salary as in effect on the date of the retention agreement; (c) the relocation of his principal place of employment to a location other than the corporate headquarters; (d) the failure to continue to allow him to participate in programs or plans providing opportunities for equity awards, incentive compensation and other plans on a basis not materially less favorable than enjoyed at the time of the retention agreement (other than changes similarly affecting all senior executives); (e) the failure to continue to allow him to participate in programs or plans with opportunities for benefits not materially less favorable than those enjoyed by him under any of the pension, savings, life insurance, medical, health and accident, disability or vacation plans or policies at the time of the retention agreement (other than changes similarly affecting all senior executives); or (f) any purported termination of his employment not taken in accordance with his retention agreement.

Aggregate Termination Payments

The tables below reflect the amount of compensation each of the Named Executive Officers would have received if his or her employment had been terminated as of December 31, 2019 under the various scenarios described above.  For purposes of these tables, a stock price of $119.80 was used, which was the closing market price on December 31, 2019, the last trading day of the year.





1)

See “2019 Pension Benefits” for a description of the pension benefits Mr. Bakken, Mr. Ellis, Mr. Fisackerly, Ms. Landreaux, Mr. Marsh, and Mr. West may receive upon the occurrence of certain termination events.

2)

As of December 31, 2019, Mr. Brown, Mr. Denault, Mr. May, and Ms. Rainer are retirement eligible and would retire rather than voluntarily resign, and in addition to the payments and benefits in the table, Mr. Brown, Mr. Denault, Mr. May, and Ms. Rainer also would be entitled to receive their vested pension benefits under the Entergy Retirement Plan.  For a description of these benefits, see “2019 Pension Benefits.”

3)

For purposes of the table, the value of Mr. Denault’s payments was calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the 2016-2018 Performance Unit Program (41,700) by the closing price of Entergy stock on December 31, 2019 ($119.80), which would equal a payment of $4,995,660 for the forfeited performance units for each performance period. The value of Mr. Bakken’s, Mr. Brown’s, Mr. Marsh’s, and Mr. West’s payments was calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the 2016-2018 Performance Unit Program (8,200) by the closing price of Entergy stock on December 31, 2019 ($119.80), which would equal a payment of $982,360 for the forfeited performance units for each performance period. The value of Mr. May’s payment was calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the 2016-2018 Performance Unit Program (2,700) by the closing price of Entergy stock on December 31, 2019 ($119.80), which would equal a payment of $323,460 for the forfeited performance units for each performance period.  The value of the payments for the other Named Executives Officers was calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the 2016-2018 Performance Unit Program (1,800) by



the closing price of Entergy stock on December 31, 2019 ($119.80), which would equal a payment of $215,640 for the forfeited performance units for each performance period.

For purposes of the table, the values of the awards payable in the event of retirement in the case of Mr. Brown, Mr. Denault, Mr. May, or Ms. Rainer or upon death or disability, other than Mr. Denault, for each Named Executive Officer were calculated as follows:

Mr. Denault’s:

2018-2020 Performance Period: 28,467 (24/36 × 42,700) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $119.80

2019-2021 Performance Period: 13,503 (12/36 × 40,508) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $119.80

Mr. Bakken’s:

2018-2020 Performance Period: 5,267 (24/36 × 7,900) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $119.80

2019-2021 Performance Period: 3,190 (12/36 × 9,568) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $119.80

Mr. Marsh’s:

2018-2020 Performance Period: 5,267 (24/36 × 7,900) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $119.80

2019-2021 Performance Period: 3,957 (12/36 × 11,869) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $119.80

Mr. West’s:

2018-2020 Performance Period: 5,267 (24/36 × 7,900) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $119.80

2019-2021 Performance Period: 3,358 (12/36 × 10,073) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $119.80

Mr. May’s:

2018-2020 Performance Period: 1,700 (24/36 × 2,550) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $119.80

2019-2021 Performance Period: 717 (12/36 × 2,150) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $119.80

Mr. Fisackerly’s and Ms. Rainer’s:

2018-2020 Performance Period: 1,100 (24/36 × 1,650) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $119.80

Ms. Landreaux’s:

2018-2020 Performance Period: 917 (24/36 × 1,375) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $119.80



2019-2021 Performance Period: 484 (12/36 × 1,450) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $119.80

Mr. Ellis’s:

2018-2020 Performance Period: 734 (24/36 × 1,100) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $119.80

2019-2021 Performance Period: 484 (12/36 × 1,450) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $119.80

4)

For purposes of the table, the value of Mr. Denault’s retention payment was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2015-2017 Performance Unit Program (33,100) and from the 2016-2018 Performance Unit Program (41,700). This average number of units (37,400) multiplied by the closing price of Entergy stock on December 31, 2019 ($119.80) would equal a payment of $4,480,520.

5)

Pursuant to the System Executive Continuity Plan, in the event of a termination related to a change in control, Mr. Bakken, Mr. Marsh, and Mr. West would be eligible to receive Entergy-subsidized COBRA benefits for 18 months and Mr. Ellis, Mr. Fisackerly, and Ms. Landreaux would be eligible to receive Entergy-subsidized COBRA benefits for 12 months.

6)

Upon retirement, Mr. Brown, Mr. Denault, Mr. May, and Ms. Rainer would be eligible for retiree medical and dental benefits, the same as all other retirees.

7)

Mr. Bakken’s 20,000 restricted stock units vest in two equal installments on April 6, 2022 and April 6, 2025. In the event of a change in control, the unvested restricted stock units will fully vest upon Mr. Bakken’s Qualifying Termination during a change in control period. Pursuant to his restricted stock unit agreement, Mr. Bakken is subject to certain restrictions on his ability to compete with Entergy and its affiliates or solicit its employees or customers during and for 12 months after his employment with his Entergy employer. In addition, the restricted stock unit agreement limits Mr. Bakken’s ability to disparage Entergy and its affiliates. In the event of a breach of these restrictions, other than following certain constructive terminations of his employment, Mr. Bakken will forfeit any restricted stock units that are not yet vested and paid, and must repay to Entergy any shares of Entergy stock paid to him in respect of the restricted stock units and any amounts he received upon the sale or transfer of any such shares.

8)

Mr. Marsh’s 21,100 restricted stock units vest 100% in 2020. Pursuant to his restricted stock unit agreement, any unvested restricted stock units will vest immediately in the event of his termination of employment due to Mr. Marsh’s total disability or death or a Qualifying Termination during a change in control period. Pursuant to his restricted stock unit agreement, Mr. Marsh is subject to certain restrictions on his ability to compete with Entergy and its affiliates during and for 12 months after his employment with Entergy, or to solicit its employees or customers during and for 24 months after his employment with Entergy. In addition, the restricted stock unit agreement limits Mr. Marsh’s ability to disparage Entergy and its affiliates. In the event of a breach of these restrictions, Mr. Marsh will forfeit any restricted stock units that are not yet vested and paid, and must repay to Entergy any shares of Entergy stock paid to him in respect of the restricted stock units and any amounts he received upon the sale or transfer of any such shares.

Pay Ratio

As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the following disclosure is being provided about the relationship of the annual total compensation of the employees of each of the Utility operating companies to the annual total compensation of their respective Presidents and Chief Executive Officers. The pay ratio estimate for each of the Utility operating companies has been calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.

Identification of Median Employee

For each of the Utility operating companies, October 4, 2019 was selected as the date on which to determine the median employee.  This date is different from the date used in the prior year; however, the methodology used to determine



the date is consistent with that used in the prior year.   Both dates correspond to the first day of the three month period prior to fiscal year-end for which information can be obtained about employees and all subsidiaries have the same number of pay cycles.  To identify the median employee from each of the Utility operating companies’ employee population base, all compensation included in Box 5 of Form W-2 was considered with all before-tax deductions added back to this compensation (“Box 5 Compensation”).  For purposes of determining the median employee of each Utility operating company, Box 5 Compensation was selected as it is believed it is representative of the compensation received by the employees of each respective Utility operating company and is readily available.  The calculation of annual total compensation of the median employee for each Utility operating company is the same calculation used to determine total compensation for purposes of the 2019 Summary Compensation Table with respect to each of the Named Executive Officers.

Item 12.

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management

Entergy Corporation owns 100% of the outstanding common stock of registrant Entergy Texas and indirectly 100% of the outstanding common membership interests of registrants Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.  The information with respect to persons known by Entergy Corporation to be beneficial owners of more than 5% of Entergy Corporation’s outstanding common stock is included under the heading “Entergy Share Ownership - Beneficial Owners of More Than Five Percent of Entergy Common Stock” in the Entergy Corporation Proxy Statement, which information is incorporated herein by reference.  The registrants know of no contractual arrangements that may, at a subsequent date, result in a change in control of any of the registrants.

The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of common stock of Entergy Corporation and stock-based units as of January 31, 2020 for all directors and Named Executive Officers.  Unless otherwise noted, each person had sole voting and investment power over the number of shares of common stock and stock-based units of Entergy Corporation set forth across from his or her name.





(1)

The number of shares of Entergy Corporation common stock owned by each individual and by all non-employee directors and executive officers as a group does not exceed one percent of the outstanding shares of Entergy Corporation common stock.

(2)

For the non-employee directors, the balances include phantom units that are issued under the Service Recognition Program.  All non-employee directors are credited with phantom units for each year of service on the Entergy Corporation Board.  These phantom units do not have voting rights or accrue dividends, and will be settled in shares of Entergy Corporation common stock following the non-employee director’s separation from the Board.

(3)

Represents the balances of phantom units each executive holds under the defined contribution restoration plan and the deferral provisions of Entergy Corporation’s equity ownership plans.  These units will be paid out in either Entergy Corporation Common Stock or cash equivalent to the value of one share of Entergy Corporation common stock per unit on the date of payout, including accrued dividends.  The deferral period is determined by the individual and is at least two years from the award of the bonus.  Messrs. Donald and Frederickson have deferred receipt of some of their quarterly stock grants.  The deferred shares will be settled in cash in an amount equal to the market value of Entergy Corporation common stock at the end of the deferral period.



Equity Compensation Plan Information

The following table summarizes the equity compensation plan information as of December 31, 2019. Information is included for equity compensation plans approved by the shareholders.  There are no shares authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans not approved by the shareholders.

Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence

For information regarding certain relationship, related transactions and director independence of Entergy Corporation, see the Entergy Corporation Proxy Statement under the headings “Corporate Governance at Entergy - Director Independence” and “Corporate Governance - Corporate Governance Policies - Review and Approval of Related Party Transactions.”

Entergy Corporation’s Board of Directors has adopted a written Related Party Transaction Approval Policy that applies:

•

To any transaction or series of transactions in which Entergy Corporation or a subsidiary is a participant;

•

When the amount involved exceeds $120,000; and

•

When a Related Party (an Entergy Corporation director or executive officer, any nominee for director, any shareholder owning an excess of 5% of the total equity of Entergy Corporation and any immediate family member of any such person) has a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity).

The policy is administered by Entergy Corporation’s Corporate Governance Committee.  The committee will consider relevant facts and circumstance in determining whether or not to approve or ratify such a transaction, and will approve or ratify only those transactions that are, in the Corporate Governance Committee’s judgment, appropriate or desirable under the circumstances. The Corporate Governance Committee has determined that certain types of transactions do not create or involve a direct or indirect material interest, including (i) compensation and related party transactions involving a director or an executive officer solely resulting from service as a director or employment with Entergy Corporation so long as the compensation is approved by the Entergy Corporation Board of Directors (or an appropriate committee); (ii) transactions involving public utility services at rates or charges fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority; or (iii) all business relationships between Entergy Corporation and a Related Party made in the ordinary course of business on terms and conditions generally available in the marketplace an in accordance with applicable law. To Entergy Corporation’s knowledge, since January 1, 2019, neither Entergy Corporation nor any of its affiliates has participated in any Related Party transaction.

Aggregate fees billed to Entergy Corporation (consolidated), Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 by Deloitte & Touche LLP were as follows:

(b)

100% of fees paid in 2019 and 2018 were pre-approved by the Entergy Corporation Audit Committee.



Entergy Audit Committee Guidelines for Pre-approval of Independent Auditor Services

The Audit Committee has adopted the following guidelines regarding the engagement of Entergy’s independent auditor to perform services for Entergy:

1.

The independent auditor will provide the Audit Committee, for approval, an annual engagement letter outlining the scope of services proposed to be performed during the fiscal year, including audit services and other permissible non-audit services (e.g. audit-related services, tax services, and all other services).

2.

For other permissible services not included in the engagement letter, Entergy management will submit a description of the proposed service, including a budget estimate, to the Audit Committee for pre-approval.  Management and the independent auditor must agree that the requested service is consistent with the SEC’s rules on auditor independence prior to submission to the Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee, at its discretion, will pre-approve permissible services and has established the following additional guidelines for permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor:

•

Aggregate non-audit service fees are targeted at fifty percent or less of the approved audit service fee.

•

All other services should only be provided by the independent auditor if it is a highly qualified provider of that service or if the Audit Committee pre-approves the independent audit firm to provide the service.

3.

The Audit Committee will be informed quarterly as to the status of pre-approved services actually provided by the independent auditor.

4.

To ensure prompt handling of unexpected matters, the Audit Committee delegates to the Audit Committee Chair or its designee the authority to approve permissible services and fees.  The Audit Committee Chair or designee will report action taken to the Audit Committee at the next scheduled Audit Committee meeting.

5.

The Vice President and General Auditor will be responsible for tracking all independent auditor fees and will report quarterly to the Audit Committee.
