                                     PART I

ITEM  1.   Business.

General  Information
- --------------------

Texas Instruments Incorporated ("TI" or the "company," including subsidiaries
except where the context indicates otherwise) is headquartered in Dallas, Texas,
and has manufacturing, design or sales operations in more than 25 countries.
TI's largest geographic markets are in the United States, Asia, Japan and
Europe. TI has been in operation since 1930.

The financial information with respect to TI's business segments and operations
outside the United States, which is contained in the note to the financial
statements captioned "Business Segment and Geographic Area Data" on pages C-25
through C-27 of TI's proxy statement for the 2002 annual meeting of
stockholders, is incorporated herein by reference to such proxy statement.

Semiconductor
- -------------

TI is a global semiconductor company and a leading designer and supplier of
digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits, the engines driving
the digitization of electronics. These two types of semiconductor products work
together in digital electronic devices such as digital cellular phones. Digital
signal processors and analog integrated circuits enable a wide range of new
products and features for TI's more than 30,000 customers in commercial,
industrial and consumer markets.

TI also is a world leader in the design and manufacturing of other semiconductor
products. Those products include standard logic devices, application-specific
integrated circuits, reduced instruction-set computing microprocessors,
microcontrollers and digital imaging devices.

The semiconductor business comprised 83% of TI's 2001 revenues. TI's
semiconductor products are used in a diverse range of electronic systems,
including cellular telephones, personal computers, servers, communications
infrastructure equipment, digital cameras, digital audio players, motor
controls, automobiles and digital imaging systems including projector and
television systems. Products are sold to original-equipment manufacturers,
contract manufacturers and distributors. TI's semiconductor patent portfolio has
been established as an ongoing contributor to semiconductor revenues. Revenues
generated from sales to TI's top five semiconductor customers accounted for
approximately 29% of total semiconductor revenues in 2001.

The semiconductor business is intensely competitive, subject to rapid
technological change and pricing pressures, and requires high rates of
investment. TI faces strong competition in all of its semiconductor product
lines. The rapid pace of change and technological breakthroughs constantly
create new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups, which can
quickly render existing technologies less valuable. In digital signal
processors, TI competes with a growing number of large and small companies, both
U.S.-based and international. New product development capabilities, applications





support, software knowledge and advanced semiconductor process technology are
the primary competitive factors in this business.

The market for analog integrated circuits is highly fragmented. TI competes with
many large and small companies, both U.S.-based and international. Primary
competitive factors in this business are the availability of innovative designs
and designers, a broad range of process technologies and applications support
and, particularly in the standard products area, price.


Other TI Businesses
- -------------------

In addition to semiconductors, TI has two other principal segments. The largest,
representing 12% of TI's 2001 revenues, is Sensors & Controls. This business
sells electrical and electronic controls, sensors and radio-frequency
identification systems into commercial and industrial markets. Typically the top
supplier in targeted product areas, Sensors & Controls faces strong
multinational and regional competitors. The primary competitive factors in this
business are product reliability, manufacturing costs and engineering expertise.
The products of the business are sold to original equipment manufacturers and
distributors. Revenues generated from sales to TI's top five Sensors & Controls
customers accounted for approximately 24% of total Sensors & Controls revenues
in 2001.

Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) represents 5% of TI's 2001 revenues
and is a leading supplier of graphing and educational calculators. This business
sells primarily through retailers and to schools through instructional dealers.
TI's principal competitors in this business are Japan- and U.S.-based companies.
Technology expertise, price and infrastructure for education and market
understanding are primary competitive factors in this business. Revenues
generated from sales to TI's top five E&PS customers accounted for approximately
44% of total E&PS revenues in 2001.


Acquisitions  and  Divestitures
- -------------------------------

From time to time TI considers acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen
its business portfolio. TI may effect one or more of these transactions at such
time or times as it determines to be appropriate. In the third quarter of 2001,
TI acquired Graychip, a developer of digital up- and down-converters. This
acquisition strengthened TI's product offering for high-speed signal processing
applications such as digital radio, wireless basestations, point-to-point
microwave communications, broadband wireless access, cable modem head-ends, and
digital video systems. Graychip also provided expertise in data conversion
across multiple cellular standards.


Backlog
- -------

The dollar amount of backlog of orders believed by TI to be firm was $1036
million as of December 31, 2001 and $2411 million as of December 31, 2000.
Backlog orders are, under certain circumstances, subject to cancellation. Also,
there is generally a short cycle between order and shipment. Accordingly, the
company believes that its backlog as of any particular date may not be
indicative of revenue for any future period.





Raw  Materials
- --------------

TI purchases materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers. The
materials, parts and supplies essential to TI's business are generally available
at present and TI believes at this time that such materials, parts and supplies
will be available in the foreseeable future.


Patents  and  Trademarks
- ------------------------

TI owns many patents in the United States and other countries in fields relating
to its business. The company has developed a strong, broad-based patent
portfolio. TI also has several agreements with other companies involving license
rights and anticipates that other licenses may be negotiated in the future. TI
does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent or
patent license, although taken as a whole, the rights of TI and the products
made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to TI's business.

TI owns trademarks that are used in the conduct of its business. These
trademarks are valuable assets, the most important of which are "Texas
Instruments" and TI's corporate monogram.


Research  and  Development
- --------------------------

TI's research and development expense was $1598 million in 2001, compared with
$1747 million in 2000 and $1379 million in 1999. Included is a charge for the
value of acquisition-related purchased in-process research and development of
zero in 2001, $112 million in 2000 and $79 million in 1999.


Seasonality
- -----------

TI's revenues and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation.


Employees
- ---------

The information concerning the number of persons employed by TI at December 31,
2001 on page C-31 of TI's proxy statement for the 2002 annual meeting of
stockholders is incorporated herein by reference to such proxy statement.


Cautionary Statements Regarding Future Results of Operations
- ------------------------------------------------------------

You should read the following cautionary statements in conjunction with the
factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of TI's filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by
reference in these filings. These cautionary statements are intended to





highlight certain factors that may affect the financial condition and results of
operations of TI and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that
apply to companies with broad international operations, such as TI. Like other
businesses, TI is susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the United States or
abroad that may affect the general economic climate and performance of TI or its
customers. Similarly, the price of TI's securities is subject to volatility due
to fluctuations in general market conditions, differences in TI's results of
operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community
and other factors beyond TI's control.


Further Weakening or Delayed Recovery in the Semiconductor Market May Adversely
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Affect TI's Performance.
- -----------------------

TI's semiconductor business represents its largest business segment and the
principal source of its revenues. The semiconductor market has historically been
cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns. After strong growth in
1999 and 2000, the semiconductor market declined significantly in 2001. Further
weakening or delayed recovery in the semiconductor market could adversely affect
TI's results of operations and have an adverse effect on the market price of its
securities. In particular, TI's strategic focus in this business is on the
development and marketing of digital signal processors and analog integrated
circuits. While TI believes that focusing its efforts on digital signal
processors and analog integrated circuits offers the best opportunity for TI to
achieve its strategic goals and that TI has developed, and will continue to
develop, a wide range of innovative and technologically advanced products, the
results of TI's operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for
digital signal processors or analog integrated circuits decreases or if these
markets or key end-equipment markets such as telecommunications and computers
grow at a pace significantly less than that expected by management.


The Technology Industry is Characterized by Rapid Technological Change that
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requires TI to Develop New Technologies and Products.
- ----------------------------------------------------

TI's results of operations depend in part upon its ability to successfully
develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing
technological environment. TI requires significant capital to develop new
technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that, in turn, may
result in shortened product lifecycles. Moreover, expenditures for technology
and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for
such developments can be assured. As a result, there can be no assurance that TI
will successfully develop and market these new products, that the products TI
does develop and market will be well received by customers or that TI will
realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products.


TI Faces Substantial Competition that Requires TI to Respond Rapidly to Product
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Development and Pricing Pressures.
- ---------------------------------


TI faces intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which
it operates. TI expects that the level of this competition will increase in the





future from large, established semiconductor and related product companies, as
well as from emerging companies serving niche markets also served by TI. Certain
of TI's competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management
resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against
those products of TI that currently offer technological and/or price advantages
over competitive products. Competition results in price and product development
pressures, which may result in reduced profit margins and lost business
opportunities in the event that TI is unable to match price declines or
technological, product, applications support, software or manufacturing advances
of its competitors.


TI's Performance Depends upon its Ability to Enforce Its Intellectual Property
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rights and to Develop or License New Intellectual Property.
- ----------------------------------------------------------

TI benefits from royalties generated from various license agreements that will
generally be in effect through the year 2005. Access to worldwide markets
depends on the continued strength of TI's intellectual property portfolio.
Future royalty revenue depends on the strength of TI's portfolio and enforcement
efforts, and on the sales and financial stability of TI's licensees. TI actively
enforces and protects its intellectual property rights, but there can be no
assurance that TI's efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or
improper use of the protected technology. Moreover, there can be no assurance
that, as TI's business expands into new areas, TI will be able to independently
develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct its business
or that it can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of
others. TI may have to rely increasingly on licensed technology from others. To
the extent that TI relies on licenses from others, there can be no assurance
that it will be able to obtain all of the licenses it desires in the future on
terms it considers reasonable or at all.


A Decline in Demand in Certain End-User Markets Could Have a Material Adverse
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Effect on the Demand for TI's Products and Results of Operations.
- ----------------------------------------------------------------

TI's customer base includes companies in a wide range of industries, but TI
generates a significant amount of revenues from sales to customers in the
telecommunications and computer-related industries. Within these industries, a
large portion of TI revenues is generated by the sale of digital signal
processors and analog integrated circuits to customers in the cellular phone,
personal computer and communications infrastructure markets. Many of TI's
end-user markets declined significantly in 2001. Further decline in any one or
several of these end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the
demand for TI's products and its results of operations.


TI's Global Manufacturing, Design and Sales Activities Subject It to Risks
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Associated with Legal, Political, Economic or Other Changes.
- -----------------------------------------------------------

TI operates in more than 25 countries worldwide and in 2001 more than 72% of its
revenues came from sales to locations outside the United States. Operating
internationally exposes TI to changes in the laws or policies, as well as the





general economic conditions, security risks and possible disruptions in
transportation networks, of the various countries in which it operates, which
could result in an adverse effect on TI's business operations in such countries
and its results of operations. Also, as discussed in more detail on pages C-12
and C-37 of TI's proxy statement for the 2002 annual meeting of stockholders, TI
uses forward currency exchange contracts to minimize the adverse earnings impact
from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the company's non-U.S. dollar
net balance sheet exposures. Nevertheless, in periods when the U.S. dollar
strengthens in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which TI transacts
business, the remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse
effect on TI's non-U.S. business.


The Loss of or Significant Curtailment of Purchases by any of TI's Largest
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Customers Could Adversely Affect TI's Results of Operations.
- -----------------------------------------------------------

While TI generates revenues from thousands of customers worldwide, the loss of
or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of its top customers,
including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing
policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer inventory
adjustments may adversely affect TI's results of operations.


TI's Performance Depends on the Availability of Raw Materials and Critical
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manufacturing Equipment.
- -----------------------

Limited or delayed access to key raw materials used in the manufacturing process
or critical manufacturing equipment could adversely impact TI's results of
operations.


TI's Continued Success Depends Upon Its Ability to Retain and Recruit a
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sufficient Number of Qualified Employees in a Competitive Environment.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

TI's continued success depends on the retention and recruitment of skilled
personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel.
Experienced personnel in the electronics industry are in high demand and
competition for their skills is intense. There can be no assurance that TI will
be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that it requires.


Available Information
- ---------------------

TI files annual, quarterly and special reports, proxy statements and other
information with the SEC. You may read and copy any reports, statements and
other information filed by TI at the SEC's public reference rooms at 450 Fifth
Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, or at the SEC offices in New York, New

TI's facilities in the United States contained approximately 15,800,000 square
feet as of December 31, 2001, of which approximately 2,400,000 square feet were
leased. TI's facilities outside the United States contained approximately
5,900,000 square feet as of December 31, 2001, of which approximately 1,500,000
square feet were leased.

TI believes that its existing properties are in good condition and suitable for
the manufacture of its products. At the end of 2001, the company utilized
substantially all of the space in its facilities.

Leases covering TI's leased facilities expire at varying dates generally within
the next 10 years. TI anticipates no difficulty in either retaining occupancy
through lease renewals, month-to-month occupancy or purchases of leased
facilities, or replacing the leased facilities with equivalent facilities.





ITEM  3.  Legal Proceedings.

Italian government auditors have substantially completed a review, conducted in
the ordinary course, of approximately $250 million of grants from the Italian
government to TI's former memory operations in Italy. The auditors have raised a
number of issues relating to compliance with grant requirements and the
eligibility of specific expenses for the grants. As part of a government
reorganization with respect to program contracts, responsibility for review of
the auditor's findings was transferred from the Ministry of the Treasury to the
Ministry of Economics and Finance. Depending on the Ministry of Economics and
Finance's decision, the review may result in a demand from the Italian
government that TI repay a portion of the grants. The company believes that the
grants were obtained and used in compliance with applicable law and contractual
obligations.

TI is involved in various investigations and proceedings conducted by the
federal Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies
regarding disposal of waste materials. Although the factual situations and the
progress of each of these matters differ, the company believes that the amount
of its liability will not have a material adverse effect upon its financial
position or results of operations.

"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995:

This report includes "forward-looking statements" intended to qualify for the
safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified
by phrases such as TI or its management "believes," "expects," "anticipates,"
"foresees," "forecasts," "estimates" or other words or phrases of similar
import. Similarly, statements herein that describe TI's business strategy,
outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking
statements. All such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in
forward-looking statements.

We urge you to carefully consider the following important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations of TI or its
management:

- -  Market demand for semiconductors, particularly for digital signal
   processors and analog chips in key markets, such as
   telecommunications and computers.

- -  TI's ability to develop, manufacture and market innovative products
   in a rapidly changing technological environment.

- -  TI's ability to compete in products and prices in an intensely competitive
   industry.

- -  TI's ability to maintain and enforce a strong intellectual property
   portfolio and obtain needed licenses from third parties.

- -  Timely completion and successful integration of announced acquisitions.





- -  Economic, social and political conditions in the countries in which TI, its
   customers or its suppliers operate, including security risks, possible
   disruptions in the transportation networks and fluctuations in foreign
   currency exchange rates.

- -  Losses or curtailments of purchases from key customers or the timing of
   customer inventory adjustments.

- -  TI's ability to recruit and retain skilled personnel.

- -  Availability of raw materials and critical manufacturing equipment.

For a more detailed discussion of these factors see the text under the heading
"Cautionary Statements Regarding Future Results of Operations" in Item 1 of
this report. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made
only as of the date of this report and TI undertakes no obligation to update
the forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

          "Sec.  1-14.  Election Period. "Election Period" means the one or more

          designated  for  participation  as  a  Designated  Employee."

3.   Effective April 1, 2001, Section 3-5 is amended and restated in the

4.   Effective  April  1,  2001,  Section  3-11  is  amended and restated in the

          hereunder  for child support, spousal maintenance, property settlement
          or  alimony  (an "Alternate Payee Claim") shall be treated in the same
          manner  as  would  a  claim  for corresponding benefits under the U.S.

          claims  provisions and restrictions of those plans; provided, however,

          order  issued  pursuant  to  an  Alternative  Payee  Claim may require
          payment  in  any other form than a full lump sum distribution equal to
          the  present  value  (as  determined  by  the  Administrator)  of  the
          Alternate  Payee  Claim.  The  Administrator  may  delegate  the
          administration  of  Alternate  Payee  Claims  to  the  Administration
          Committee  under  the  U.S.  Retirement  Plan  or the Universal Plan."

5.   Effective  April  1,  2001, Section 3-7 (iv) is amended by adding

          distributed  in  a  single  lump  sum."

6.   Effective January 1, 1998, Section 5-2 is hereby amended and
     restated  in  the  entirety,  to  read  as  follows:

7.   Effective  January 1, 1998, Section 5-4 is hereby amended by
     addition  of  the  following  sentence  at  the  end:

          "The  Administrator  in its discretion shall determine whether, and to
          what extent, Participant accounts will be charged with the expenses of
          administration  of  the  Plan.  Expenses  charged  against Participant
          accounts shall be charged as adjustments under Section 3-4 and Section
          3-7,  as  applicable.  Expenses of the Plan not charged to Participant
          accounts  shall  be  paid  by  TI."

                                  ARTICLE THREE

                       COVENANTS AND CONSULTING AGREEMENT
                       ----------------------------------

     3.1 COVENANTS. Executive shall be subject to the following covenants and
obligations:

     3.1.1 RETURN OF DOCUMENTS. Upon the termination of Executive's employment
for any reason, Executive shall promptly relinquish and return to the Company
all Confidential Information and all files, correspondence, memoranda, diaries
and other records, minutes, notes, manuals, papers and other documents and data,

relating to the business of the Company, that are in Executive's custody or
control, whether or not they contain Confidential Information.

     3.1.2 NON-COMPETITION COVENANT. While employed by the Company, Executive
shall not Compete or plan or prepare to Compete with the Company. To the extent
obligated pursuant to the provisions of ARTICLE FOUR, Executive shall not, for a
period of twelve (12) months following the termination of his employment,
Compete with any line of business in which (i) the Company is engaged at the
time his employment terminates or (ii) the Company is preparing to engage
pursuant to plans or proposals approved by the Board prior to such termination.

     3.1.3 NON-SOLICITATION COVENANT. For a period of twenty-four (24) months
following the termination of Executive's employment with the Company for any
reason, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit the services of any
Company employees or otherwise induce or attempt to induce any Company employees
to sever their employment relationship with the Company.

     3.1.4 SCOPE AND DURATION: SEVERABILITY. The Company and Executive
understand and agree that the scope and duration of the covenants contained in
this Section 3.1 are reasonable both in time and geographical area and are
fairly necessary to protect the business of the Company. Such covenants shall
survive the termination of Executive's employment, except that the Section 3.1.2
non-competition covenant shall remain in effect following such termination of
employment only to extent required pursuant to the provisions of ARTICLE FOUR.
It is further agreed that such covenants shall be regarded as divisible and
shall be operative as to time and geographical area to the extent that they may
be made so operative, and should any portion of such covenants be declared
invalid or unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of the remainder shall
not be affected.





     3.1.5 ASSIGNMENT. Except as otherwise provided to the contrary in ARTICLE
FOUR, Executive agrees that the covenants contained in this Section 3.1 shall
inure to the benefit of any successor or assign of the Company, with the same
force and effect as if such covenant had been made by Executive with such
successor or assign.

     3.2 CONSULTING AGREEMENT. Upon the termination of Executive's
employment-other than in connection with (i) a voluntary termination by
Executive under Section 4.5 or (ii) a termination by the Company for Misconduct,
Executive hereby agrees to make himself available to perform, for a period not
to exceed twelve (12) months following such termination of employment, such
consulting services for the Company within his area of expertise as may from
time to time be reasonably requested by the Board, and the Company may not
terminate the consulting arrangement during such twelve (12)-month other than
for Misconduct or a breach by Executive of his non-competition covenant under
Section 3.1.2. However, Executive shall not be required to perform more than ten
(10) hours of consulting services per month during the period of such consulting
arrangement.

     3.2.1 COMPENSATION Executive shall not receive any cash compensation for
the consulting services rendered pursuant to this Section 3.2 if Executive is
otherwise to receive salary continuation payments (or disability income
payments) under ARTICLE FOUR in connection with his termination of employment.
However, if Executive is required under Section 3.2 to render one or more hours
of consulting services following a termination of employment in which he is not
entitled to any salary continuation payments (or disability income payments)
under ARTICLE FOUR, then Executive shall receive cash compensation for such
services at the hourly rate to be negotiated in good faith with the Company at
the time of each project assignment.

     3.2.2 EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT. Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement
of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
performance of his consulting services pursuant to this Section 3.2 upon

                           PAYOUT OF CONTRACT BENEFITS
                           ---------------------------

     4.1 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. Executive's employment may be terminated by
either Executive or the Company at any time for the reasons and with the
consequences set out below. In the event of such termination, Executive may
become entitled to certain severance benefits under this Agreement in accordance
with the provisions of this ARTICLE FOUR.

     4.2 DEATH. Executive's employment shall terminate upon his death.

     4.2.1 SEVERANCE BENEFITS. In such event, the Company shall provide the
following severance benefits:

     -    Salary  continuation  payments  at  the monthly rate of base salary in
          effect  for  Executive  at  the  time  of  his  death shall be paid to
          Executive's  designated  Beneficiary  for a period of three (3) months
          following the date of Executive's death. The payments shall be made in
          accordance  with  the  Company's normal payroll practices and shall be
          subject  to  the  Company's  collection  of all applicable withholding
          taxes.

     -    The  Company  shall,  at  its  expense,  provide Executive's surviving
          spouse  and  other  eligible  dependents  with  continued  Health Care
          Coverage  until the earlier of (i) eighteen (18) months after the date
          of  Executive's death or (ii) the first date that such individuals are
          covered under another employer's health benefit program which provides
          substantially  the  same  level  of  benefits  without  exclusion  for
          pre-existing  medical  conditions.  Such  coverage  will  be  in  full
          satisfaction  of  any  continued  health  care  coverage  to  which
          Executive's surviving spouse or dependents would otherwise be entitled
          pursuant  to  the  requirements  of  Code  Section  4980B by reason of
          Executive's termination of employment ("COBRA Continuation Coverage").

     4.3 LONG-TERM DISABILITY. Either the Company or Executive may terminate
Executive's employment, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice, by reason of
his Long-Term Disability. Any such termination by the Company, however, shall be
subject to the Company's compliance with the applicable requirements of the
Americans with Disabilities Act.





     4.3.1 COVENANTS. Following such termination of employment, Executive shall
remain subject to the covenants and obligations set forth in Section 3.1 and
Section 3.2 (but only the extent Executive is physically able to perform any
consulting services in accordance therewith).

     4.3.2 DISABILITY INCOME. Executive shall be entitled to receive short-term
and long-term disability income benefits from the following sources in
connection with the termination of his employment under this Section 4.3:

     -    Executive  shall be entitled to receive short-term disability benefits
          in  the  form  of salary continuation payments, at one hundred percent
          (100%)  of  his  base  salary,  for  the  first  six (6) months of his
          disability  period.  Such payments shall be made pursuant to the terms
          of  the  Company's  Short-Term Disability Income Plan, and Executive's
          eligibility for such payments shall be determined solely in accordance
          with  the  terms  of  that  Plan.

     -    Upon  the  expiration  of  the  salary  continuation  period under the
          Short-Term  Disability Income Plan, Executive shall become entitled to
          receive  salary  continuation  payments  in  the  monthly  amount  of
          Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) pursuant to the terms of the
          special  long-term  disability income policies which the Company shall
          maintain  on  Executive's behalf. Such monthly payments shall continue
          until the earliest to occur of (i) Executive's attainment of age sixty
          five  (65)  or  (ii)  his  failure to qualify for continued disability
          income  payments under the terms of those policies or (iii) his return
          to  full-time  employment with the Company or other business entity in
          substantially  the  same  position  he  held  immediately prior to his
          disability.  Should  Executive's  attainment of age sixty five (65) be
          the  earliest  event,  then such salary continuation payments shall be
          reduced  to  the  amount  of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00) per
          month  and shall continue at that level until the earliest to occur of
          (i)  Executive's  death  or  (ii) his failure to qualify for continued
          disability  income payments under the terms of those policies or (iii)
          his  return to full-time employment with the Company or other business
          entity in substantially the same position he held immediately prior to
          his  disability.

     The  long-term  disability  income  policies shall be purchased from one or
     more  insurance companies mutually acceptable to the Company and Executive,
     and  all  premiums  on  those  policies  shall  be paid by the Company. The
     Company  shall, throughout the term of this Agreement, continue to maintain
     the  existing  long-term income policies currently in effect for Executive.
     Such policies shall, however, be reviewed at least annually in terms of the
     financial  stability  of  the  insurer,  and the Company shall use its best
     efforts  to  obtain  replacement  policies  from  one  or  more  other
     financially-solvent  insurance  companies,  to  the  extent  the  insurance





     company  issuing  one  or  more  of  the  current policies is deemed by the
     Company  or  Executive to pose an unacceptable risk of insolvency. However,
     should  Executive be unable to qualify to qualify for coverage under one or
     more  replacement  policies  needed to provide the benefits contemplated by
     this  Section  4.3.2,  then  Executive's  entitlement  to disability income
     payments  hereunder  shall  be  reduced  to the actual dollar amount of the
     income  payments provided by the remaining policies and shall be reduced to
     zero  if  there  are  no  remaining  policies.

     Executive  shall  look  exclusively  to the Company's Short-Term Disability
     Income  Plan and any long-term disability income policies maintained on his
     behalf  pursuant  to  this  Section 4.3.2 for the payment of his disability
     benefits hereunder, and the Company shall have no obligation to provide any
     long-term  disability  income  payments  out of the Company's own funds and
     shall  not  be the guarantor of the disability income benefits contemplated
     by  this  Section  4.3.2.

     4.3.3 HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. The Company shall, at its expense, provide
Executive and his eligible dependents with continued Health Care Coverage until
the earliest to occur of (i) the Executive's death or (ii) the first date that
such individuals are covered under another employer's health benefit program
which provides substantially the same level of benefits without exclusion for
pre-existing medical conditions or (iii) his return to full-time employment with
the Company or other business entity in substantially the same position he held
immediately prior to his disability. The period of such Company-paid coverage
shall be credited against any period of COBRA Continued Care Coverage to which
Executive and his eligible dependents may, at their sole cost, be entitled by
reason of Executive's termination of employment and shall not be in addition to
such period of COBRA Continued Care Coverage.

     4.4 TERMINATION BY THE COMPANY FOR MISCONDUCT. The Company may terminate
Executive's employment for Misconduct.

     4.4.1 NO CONTRACT BENEFITS. Should Executive's employment be terminated for
Misconduct, Executive shall have no right to receive any severance benefits
under this Agreement. However, Executive shall be entitled to receive (i) any
unpaid compensation earned for services rendered through the date of such
termination and (ii) any accrued but unpaid vacation benefits or sick days.

     4.4.2 COVENANTS. Following such termination for Misconduct, Executive shall
comply with his covenants and obligations under Section 3.1 but shall not be
subject to any consulting agreement under Section 3.2.

     4.5 VOLUNTARY TERMINATION BY EXECUTIVE. Executive may, upon thirty (30)
days prior written notice to the Company, voluntarily terminate his employment
at any time.





     4.5.1 NO CONTRACT BENEFITS. Following Executive's termination of employment
under this Section 4.5, Executive shall have no right to receive any severance
benefits under this Agreement, but he and his eligible dependents shall be
entitled, at their sole cost, to receive COBRA Continuation Coverage. In
addition, Executive shall be entitled to receive (i) any unpaid compensation
earned for services rendered through the date of such termination and (ii) any
accrued but unpaid vacation benefits or sick days.

    4.5.2 COVENANTS. Following such termination of employment, Executive shall
comply with his covenants and obligations under Section 3.1 (other than Section
3.1.2) but shall not be subject to any consulting agreement under Section 3.2.

     4.6 TERMINATION BY THE COMPANY FOR JUSTIFIABLE REASON. The Company may
terminate Executive's employment at any time for Justifiable Reason.

    4.6.1 SEVERANCE BENEFITS. Upon the Company's termination of Executive's
employment under this Section 4.6, the Company shall provide the following
severance benefits:

     -    Executive shall be entitled to receive an immediate lump sum severance
          payment  equal  to  one (1) times his Average Annual Compensation. The
          payment  shall  be  made  within  thirty  (30)  days  following  the
          Executive's  termination  date  and  shall be subject to the Company's
          collection  of  all  applicable  withholding  taxes

     -    Executive  shall  be entitled to receive salary continuation payments,
          at  the  monthly  rate of base salary in effect for him at the time of
          his termination of employment, for a period of twelve (12) months. The
          payments shall be made in accordance with the Company's normal payroll
          practices  and  shall  be  subject  to the Company's collection of all
          applicable  withholding  taxes. Payments shall commence with the first
          payday  following  Executive's  termination  date.  However,  should
          Executive  obtain a position of full-time employment during the salary
          continuation period, then the dollar amount of the salary continuation
          payments  shall  be  reduced  by the salary earned by Executive during
          such  period  for  services  rendered  to  his  new  employer.

     -    The  Company shall, at its expense, provide Executive and his eligible
          dependents with continued Health Care Coverage until the earlier of
          (i) twelve (12) months after the Executive's termination date or (ii)
          the first date that such individuals are covered under another
          employer's health  benefit program which provides substantially the
          same level of benefits  without  exclusion  for pre-existing medical
          conditions. The period  of  such  Company-paid  coverage shall be
          credited against any period of COBRA Continued Care Coverage to which





          Executive and his eligible dependents may, at their sole cost, be
          entitled by .reason of Executive's termination of employment and shall
          not be in addition to such period of COBRA Continued Care Coverage.

          and  his  eligible  dependents may, at their sole cost, be entitled by
          reason  of  Executive's  termination of employment and shall not be in

occurrence of any of the following events:

     -    Executive  and  his  eligible  dependents become covered under another

          Coverage prior the expiration of any applicable grace period following
          the  due  date  for  such  premium;

     -    Any  Company-paid  coverage  will  immediately  terminate  should  the
          Executive  fail to perform his obligations under ARTICLE THREE, to the
          extent  those obligations are applicable pursuant to the provisions of
          ARTICLE  FOUR  following  his  termination  of  employment;  or

     -    The  Company discontinues all health care coverage programs for active

designation. In the absence of any such designation, the Beneficiary shall be
the Executive's estate.

(the "Change in Control Benefit Agreement"), contains the entire agreement and
understanding between Executive and the Company regarding the severance benefits
to which Executive may become entitled upon his cessation of employment and

be that of a general creditor of the Company and will have no priority over the
claims of other general creditors of the Company.

     5.6. DEATH. Should Executive die before receipt of all benefits to which he
may become entitled under this Agreement, then the payment of such benefits

permissible by law) the application of such provision under circumstances
different from those adjudicated by the court, the application of any other
provision of this Agreement, or the enforceability or invalidity of this
Agreement as a whole.

Company's President and Chief Executive Officer (the "Executive").

                                 R E C I T A L S
                                 - - - --- - - -

     A. The Executive is currently employed on an "at-will" basis by the Company
as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer.

     B. The Company and the Executive wish to enter into a formal agreement
under which the Executive will be provided with certain defined severance
benefits in the event his employment were to terminate under specified
circumstances following a change in control or ownership of the Company.

       NOW THEREFORE, the Company and Executive mutually agree as follows:


                                  ARTICLE ONE

with which such wages are paid during such partial year, before inclusion within
Executive's Actual Five-Year Average Compensation. If any of Executive's
compensation from the Company during such five (5)-year or shorter period was
not included in his W-2 wages for U.S. income tax purposes because such
compensation was excludible from income as foreign earned income under Code
Section 911 or as pre-tax income under Code Section 125 or 402(g), then such
compensation shall nevertheless be included in Executive's Actual Five-Year
Average Compensation to the same extent as if it were part of his W-2 wages.

amounts: (i) the average rate of base salary in effect for the Executive over

accrued by Executive on the basis of corporate and personal performance over the
three (3) fiscal years of the Company immediately preceding the fiscal year of
Executive's termination, or if greater, over the three (3)-year, period
immediately preceding the fiscal year of the Parachute Event, whether or not the
actual payment of those bonuses occurred within that three (3) year period.

which may become due and payable to Executive following his death.

          more  than  fifty  percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of
          the  Company's  then  outstanding  securities;  or

     (ii) a  merger  or  consolidation  in  which  securities  of  the  Company
          possessing  more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting
          power  of the Company's then outstanding securities are transferred to
          a  person  or  persons  different  from  the  persons  holding  those
          securities  immediately  prior  to  such  merger  or consolidation; or

     (ii) a  change in the composition of the Board over a period of twenty-four

          membership,  to  be  comprised of individuals who either (a) have been
          Board  members  continuously since the beginning of such period or (b)
          have  been  elected  or nominated for election as Board members during
          such  period  by at least a majority of the Board members described in

280G(d)(4), utilizing a discount rate equal to one hundred twenty percent (120%)

                                   ARTICLE TWO

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS
                               ------------------

     2.1 TERM. This Agreement shall remain in effect through December 31, 1999.
The term of this Agreement shall be automatically renewed for each subsequent
calendar year during which Executive continues in the Company's employ, unless
the Company terminates this Agreement as of the first day of any calendar year
beginning after December 31, 1999 by providing Executive with written notice of
such termination at least one hundred (180) days prior to the start of that
calendar year. In the event the Company elects to so terminate this Agreement
prior to a Change in Control or Hostile Take-Over, then the following provisions
shall become effective:

     -    The  Company  and Executive shall in good faith negotiate a new change
          in  control  severance  benefits  agreement to replace this Agreement,
          effective  as  of  the  termination  date  of  this  Agreement.

     -    If  agreement cannot be reached as to the terms and conditions of such
          a  replacement  agreement,  then  Executive  shall  have  the right to
          terminate  his  employment within six (6) months after the termination
          date  of  this  Agreement  and  shall  thereupon  become  entitled  to
          severance  benefits  to  be  reasonably agreed upon by the Company and
          Executive  on  the  basis  of  severance  packages  in  effect  for
          similarly-situated  chief  executive  officers  in  the  industry.

     If the Company elects to terminate this Agreement after a Change in Control
or Hostile Take-Over, then Executive shall, upon his termination of employment
within six (6) months after the effective date on which this Agreement is so
terminated, be treated as if his termination of employment were a termination by
the Company Without Cause, and all the provisions of Section 4.3 shall
accordingly apply to such termination of employment.

     2.2 OPTION GRANTS. Any new Options granted to Executive under the Plan
during the term of this Agreement shall incorporate the following terms and
provisions:

     -    Each Option shall become immediately exercisable for all of the option
          shares  as  fully-vested shares upon a Change in Control in which that
          Option is not assumed by the successor entity (or the parent company).
          Any Option so assumed in a Change in Control shall subsequently become
          exercisable  for  all  the  option  shares  as  fully-vested shares if
          Executive's  employment  is terminated within two (2) years after such
          Change  in Control either by the Company Without Cause or by Executive
          in  connection  with  a  Constructive  Termination.





     -    Each Option shall, subject to the benefit limitations of ARTICLE FIVE,
          become  immediately  exercisable  for  all  of  the  option  shares as
          fully-vested  shares  upon  the  occurrence  of  a  Hostile Take-Over.

     -    Each  Option  shall  remain  exercisable  for  a period of twelve (12)
          months  following  the  termination  of  Executive's  employment  in
          connection  with  a  Contract Payout Event, but in no event beyond the
          expiration  date  of  the  option  term.





                                  ARTICLE THREE

                       COVENANTS AND CONSULTING AGREEMENT
                      -------------------------------------

     3.1 COVENANTS. Executive shall be subject to the following covenants and
obligations:

     3.1.1 RETURN OF DOCUMENTS. Upon the termination of Executive's employment
for any reason, Executive shall promptly relinquish and return to the Company
all Confidential Information and all files, correspondence, memoranda, diaries
and other records, minutes, notes, manuals, papers and other documents and data,
however prepared or memorialized, and all copies thereof, belonging to or
relating to the business of the Company, that are in Executive's custody or
control, whether or not they contain Confidential Information.

     3.1.2 NON-COMPETITION COVENANT. While employed by the Company, Executive
shall not Compete or plan or prepare to Compete with the Company. To the extent
obligated pursuant to the provisions of ARTICLE FOUR. Executive shall not, for a
period of twelve (12) months following the termination of his employment,
Compete with any line of business in which (i) the Company is engaged at the
time his employment terminates or (ii) the Company is preparing to engage
pursuant to plans or proposals approved by the Board prior to such termination.

     3.1.3 NON-SOLICITATION COVENANT. For a period of twenty-four (24) months
following the termination of Executive's employment with the Company for any
reason other than in connection with a Hostile Take-Over, Executive shall not,
directly or indirectly, solicit the services of any Company employees or
otherwise induce or attempt to induce any Company employees to sever their
employment relationship with the Company.

     3.1.4 SCOPE AND DURATION; SEVERABILITY. The Company and Executive
understand and agree that the scope and duration of the covenants contained in
this Section 3.1 are reasonable both in time and geographical area and are
fairly necessary to protect the business of the Company. Such covenants shall
survive the termination of Executive's employment, except that the Section 3.1.2
non-competition covenant shall remain in effect following such termination of
employment only to extent required pursuant to the provisions of ARTICLE FOUR.
It is further agreed that such covenants shall be regarded as divisible and
shall be operative as to time and geographical area to the extent that they may
be made so operative, and should any portion of such covenants be declared
invalid or unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of the remainder shall
not be affected.





     3.1.5 ASSIGNMENT. Except as otherwise provided to the contrary in ARTICLE
FOUR, Executive agrees that the covenants contained in this Section 3.1 shall
inure to the benefit of any successor or assign of the Company, with the same
force and effect as if such covenant had been made by Executive with such
successor or assign.

     3.2 CONSULTING AGREEMENT. Should Executive's employment terminate within
two (2) years following a Change in Control, then Executive shall make himself
available to perform, for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months following
such termination of employment, such consulting services for the Company within
his area of expertise as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the
Board, and the Company may not terminate the consulting arrangement during such
twelve (12)-month other than for Misconduct or breach by Executive of his
non-competition covenant under Section 3.1.2. However, Executive shall not be
required to perform more than ten (10) hours of consulting services per month
during the period of such consulting arrangement. Such consulting, agreement
shall not be applicable in the event Executive's employment terminates after a
Hostile Take-Over.

     3.2.1 COMPENSATION. Executive shall not receive any cash compensation for
the consulting services rendered pursuant to this Section 3.2 if Executive is
otherwise to receive salary continuation payments under ARTICLE FOUR in
connection with his termination of employment. However, should Executive be
required under Section 3.2 to render one or more hours of consulting services
following a termination of employment in which he is not entitled to any salary
continuation payments under ARTICLE FOUR, then Executive shall receive cash
compensation for such services at the hourly rate to be negotiated in good faith
with the Company at the time of each project assignment.

     3.2.2 EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT. Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement
of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
performance of his consulting services pursuant to this Section 3.2 upon
presentation to the Company of appropriate documentation evidencing those
expenses.

     3.3 CONSIDERATION FOR COVENANTS AND CONSULTING AGREEMENT. Should
Executive's employment terminate in connection with a Change in Control, then
the value of his non-competition covenant under Section 3.1.2 and his consulting
agreement under Section 3.2 shall be determined by independent appraisal, and
the severance benefits payable to Executive under ARTICLE FOUR shall, to the
extent of such appraised value, be allocated as reasonable compensation for such
covenant and consulting agreement. Executive and the Company shall, within ten
(10) business days following such Change in Control, select an independent third
party (either an experienced tax counsel or a nationally recognized accounting
firm) to perform the appraisal required under this Section 3.3. Should Executive
and the Company be unable to mutually agree upon the selection of such third
party, then Executive shall designate a nationally recognized accounting firm to
perform such appraisal, provided such firm has not previously served as the





Company's independent auditors or provided prior tax advice to Executive on
personal matters.

     4.1 CHANGE OF CONTROL. Executive may voluntarily terminate his employment

comply with all his covenants and obligations under Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

     -    Executive  shall  be  entitled  to receive an additional benefit in an
          amount  equal  to  one (1) times his Average Annual Compensation. This

          (12)-month  period  in  accordance  with  the Company's normal payroll
          practices  and  shall  be  subject  to the Company's collection of all
          applicable  withholding  taxes.  Payment shall commence with the first
          payday  following  Executive's  termination  date.

     -    The  Company shall, at its expense, provide Executive and his eligible
          dependents  with  continued  Health Care Coverage until the earlier of
          (i)  twelve (12) months after the Executive's termination date or (ii)
          the  first  date  that  such  individuals  are  covered  under another
          employer's  health  benefit  program  which provides substantially the
          same  level  of  benefits  without  exclusion for pre-existing medical
          conditions. The period of such Company-paid coverage shall be credited
          against any period of COBRA Continued Care Coverage to which Executive
          and  his  eligible  dependents may, at their sole cost, be entitled by

          same  level  of  benefits  without  exclusion for pre-existing medical
          conditions. The period of such Company-paid coverage shall be credited

          reason  of  Executive's  termination of employment and shall not be in

          dependents  with  continued  Health Care Coverage until the earlier of
          (i)  twelve  (12) months after the date of Executive's termination or
          (ii)  the  first  date that such individuals are covered under another
          employer's  health  benefit  program  which provides substantially the
          same  level  of  benefits  without  exclusion for pre-existing medical
          conditions. The period of such Company-paid coverage shall be credited
          against any period of COBRA Continued Care Coverage to which Executive
          and  his  eligible  dependents may, at their sole cost, be entitled by
          reason  of  Executive's  termination of employment and shall not be in
          addition  to  such  period  of  COBRA  Continued  Care  Coverage.

with a Hostile Takeover, provided such termination is, pursuant to written
notice delivered to the Company, effected within two (2) years after such
Hostile Takeover.

have no obligation to perform his covenants under Section 3.1.2 or his
consulting agreement under Section 3.2.

     4.4.2 SEVERANCE BENEFITS. Upon the termination of Executive's employment in
connection with the Hostile Take-Over, the Company shall provide the following
severance benefits:





     -    Executive  shall,  within  ten  (10)  business  days  following  his
          termination of employment, receive a lump sum payment equal to two (2)
          times  his Average Annual Compensation. Such lump sum payment shall be
          subject  to  the  Company's  collection  of all applicable withholding
          taxes.

          dependents  with  continued  Health Care Coverage until the earlier of
          (i)  twelve (12) months after the Executive's termination date or (ii)
          the  first  date  that  such  individuals  are  covered  under another
          employer's  health  benefit  program  which provides substantially the
          same  level  of  benefits  without  exclusion for pre-existing medical
          conditions. The period of such Company-paid coverage shall be credited
          against any period of COBRA Continued Care Coverage to which Executive
          and  his  eligible  dependents may, at their sole cost, be entitled by
          reason  of  Executive's  termination of employment and shall not be in
          addition  to  such  period  of  COBRA  Continued  Care  Coverage.

     4.4.3 OPTION ACCELERATION. Whether or not Executive terminates his

the Hostile Takeover shall, subject to the benefit limitations of ARTICLE FIVE,
vest and become exercisable for all of the underlying shares of the Company's
common stock immediately prior to the effective date of such Hostile Takeover.
Executive may exercise his Options for such vested shares at any time until the
earlier of (i) the specified expiration date of the option term or (ii) the
expiration of the twelve (12)-month period measured from his termination date,
and any Options not exercised prior to the applicable expiration date shall
lapse.





                                  ARTICLE FIVE

                               BENEFIT LIMITATION
                              -------------------


     5.1. LIMITATION ON SEVERANCE BENEFITS. In the event of a Parachute Event,
the following limitations shall become applicable to the benefits payable to
Executive pursuant to this Agreement:

     5.1.1 BENEFIT REDUCTION. If the Parachute Event constitutes a Change in
Control, then the dollar amount of the severance benefits to which Executive
becomes entitled under ARTICLE FOUR shall be reduced to the extent necessary to
assure that the present value of those payments will not, when added to the
present value of the Option Parachute Payment and Other Parachute Payments to
which Executive may also be entitled upon such Change in Control, exceed 2.99
times Executive's Actual Five-Year Average Compensation (the "Parachute Limit").
Any acceleration of Executive's unvested Options, whether at the time of the
Change in Control or upon the subsequent termination of Executive's employment
within two (2) years after such Change in Control, shall only be limited to the
extent necessary to provide Executive with the maximum after-tax benefit
available, after taking into account any parachute excise tax which might
otherwise be payable by Executive under Code Section 4999 (and any analogous
State income tax provision) with respect to his total benefit package. However,
if the Parachute Event constitutes a Hostile Take-Over, then no reduction shall
be made to the Executive's severance benefits under ARTICLE FOUR and no
limitation shall be imposed upon the acceleration of Executive's outstanding
Options, except to the extent (if any) necessary to provide Executive with the
maximum after-tax benefit available, after taking into account any parachute
excise tax which might otherwise be payable by Executive under Code Section 4999
(and any analogous State income tax provision) with respect to his total benefit
package.

     5.1.2 RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES. Should there arise any dispute between
Executive and the Company as to whether one or more benefits to which Executive
becomes entitled (whether under this Agreement, the Options or otherwise) in
connection with a Parachute Event constitute Option Parachute Payments or Other
Parachute Payments, such dispute is to be resolved as follows:

     -    In  the  event  temporary,  proposed  or final Treasury Regulations in
          effect  at  the  time under Code Section 280G specifically address the
          status  of  such  benefits  or  the  method  for  their valuation, the
          characterization  afforded  to  such  benefits  by  the  Regulations,
          together  with  the  methods  prescribed for their valuation, shall be
          controlling.

     -    In  the  event  such  Regulations  do  not  address  the status of the
          benefits  in  dispute, the matter shall be submitted for resolution to
          independent  counsel  mutually acceptable to Executive and the Company





          ("Independent Counsel"). The resolution reached by Independent Counsel
          shall  be  final  and  controlling.  However,  should  the Independent
          Counsel  determine  that  the status of the benefits in dispute can be
          resolved  through  the  obtainment of a private letter ruling from the
          Internal  Revenue Service, a formal and proper request for such ruling
          shall  be  prepared  and  submitted  by  Independent  Counsel, and the
          determination  made  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Service in the issued
          ruling  shall be controlling. All expenses incurred in connection with
          the  retention  of  Independent  Counsel  and  (if  applicable)  the
          preparation  and submission of the ruling request shall be paid by the
          Company.

     -    The  present  value  of  each Option Parachute Payment and each of the
          Other  Parachute  Payments (including any salary continuation payments
          and  Health  Care  Coverage under ARTICLE FOUR) shall be determined in
          accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Code Section 280G(d)(4) and the
          Treasury  Regulations  issued  thereunder.

     5.1.3 HOLD-BACK OF BENEFITS. Any severance benefits to which Executive may
become entitled under ARTICLE FOUR shall not be paid to Executive until any
amounts in dispute under Section 5.1.2 have been resolved in accordance
herewith. However, any portion of such severance benefits which would not
otherwise exceed the benefit limitation of Section 5.1.1 even if all amounts in
dispute under Section 5.1.2 were to be resolved against Executive shall be paid
to Executive in accordance with the applicable provisions of ARTICLE FOUR

     5.1.4 OVERRIDING LIMITATION. Executive shall in all events be entitled to
receive the full amount of his severance benefits under ARTICLE FOUR, to the
extent those benefits, when added to the present value of his Option Parachute
Payment and Other Parachute Payments (excluding such severance benefits), will
nevertheless qualify as reasonable compensation within the standards established
under Code Section 280G(b)(4).





                                  ARTICLE SIX

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
                            ------------------------


     6.1 TERMINATION OF HEALTH COVERAGE. Any Health Care Coverage to which
Executive or his eligible dependents may become entitled pursuant to the
provisions of ARTICLE FOUR or any COBRA Continuation Coverage to which such
individuals are otherwise entitled by law shall immediately terminate upon the
occurrence of any of the following events:

     -    Executive  and  his  eligible  dependents become covered under another
          employer's  health  benefit  program  which provides substantially the
          same  level  of  benefits  without  exclusion for pre-existing medical
          conditions;

     -    The individual fails to pay the applicable premium for the Health Care
          Coverage prior the expiration of any applicable grace period following
          the  due  date  for  such  premium;

     -    Any Company-paid coverage will immediately terminate should the
          Executive-fail to perform his obligations under ARTICLE THREE, to the
          extent those obligations are applicable pursuant to the provisions of
          ARTICLE FOUR following his termination of employment; or

     -    The  Company discontinues all health care coverage programs for active
          employees.

     6.2 DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY. Executive may designate from time to time
the person or persons who are to be his designated Beneficiary under this
Agreement. Each such designation shall be evidenced by a written, signed
document delivered to the Company's Corporate Secretary, and each new
designation shall automatically supersede and revoke the prior existing
designation. In the absence of any such designation, the Beneficiary shall be
the Executive's estate.

     6.3 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, together with the Severance Benefit
Agreement (to the extent in effect at the time), contains the entire agreement
and understanding between Executive and the Company regarding the severance
benefits to which Executive may become entitled upon his cessation of employment
and supersedes and replaces all prior contracts, understandings and
representations (whether oral or written) regarding the terms and conditions of
such severance benefits. Neither this Agreement nor the Severance Benefit
Agreement may be modified except by a writing executed by both Executive and the
Company.





     6.4 ASSIGNMENT BY THE COMPANY. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of any successors or assigns of the Company. As used
in this Agreement, the term "successor" includes any person or group of persons
acting in concert who at any time in any form or manner acquires all or
substantially all of the assets or business of the Company or more than thirty
(30%) of the outstanding voting securities of the Company. Accordingly, this
Agreement, together with the Severance Benefit Agreement (to the extent
otherwise in effect at the time), shall continue in full force and effect
following any such assignment to the successor entity.

     6.5. GENERAL CREDITOR STATUS. The benefits to which Executive may become
entitled under this Agreement (except those attributable to his Options) shall
be paid, when due, from the general assets of the Company.  The right of the
Executive (or his Beneficiary) to receive any such payments shall at all times
be that of a general creditor of the Company and will have no priority over the
claims of other general creditors of the Company.

     6.6. DEATH. Should Executive die before receipt of all benefits to which he
may become entitled under this Agreement, then the payment of such benefits
shall be made, on the due date or dates hereunder had Executive survived, to his
Beneficiary. Should Executive die before he has exercised all his outstanding
vested Options, then each such Option may be exercised, during the applicable
exercise period in effect for such Option, by the executors or administrators of
Executive's estate or by the Person to whom the Option is transferred pursuant
to the Executive's will or in accordance with the laws of inheritance.

     6.7. MISCELLANEOUS. The provisions of this Agreement shall be construed and
interpreted under the laws of the State of Arizona. If any provision of this
Agreement as applied to any party or to any circumstance should be adjudged by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable for any reason, the
invalidity of that provision shall in no way affect (to the maximum extent
permissible by law) the application of such provision under circumstances
different from those adjudicated by the court, the application of any other
provision of this Agreement, or the enforceability or invalidity of this
Agreement as a whole.

     6.8 ARBITRATION. Any controversy which may arise between Executive and the
Company with respect to the construction, interpretation or application of any
of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any monetary claim
arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be submitted to final and
binding arbitration in Tucson, Arizona in accordance with the rules of the
American Arbitration Association then in effect.





     6.9 NO EMPLOYMENT OR SERVICE CONTRACT. Nothing in this Agreement shall
confer upon Executive any right to continue in the employment of the Company for
any period of specific duration or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any
way the rights of the Company or Executive, which rights are hereby expressly
reserved by each, to terminate Executive's employment at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause.

     6.10 NOTICES. Any notice provided for by this Agreement and any other
notice, demand, designation or communication which either party may wish to send
to the other ("Notices") shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
properly given if served by (i) personal delivery, (ii) registered or certified

                                October 24, 2000

To: Mr. Syrus Madavi

Re: Letter Agreement

This letter confirms our agreement on the following matters with respect to your
employment with Texas Instruments Incorporated or any of its Subsidiaries
("Company").

Effective 1/1/01, you shall receive a base salary at an annual rate of $425,000,
payable in accordance with the applicable payroll practices and subject to
increases at the sole discretion of TI. You will be eligible to participate in
employee benefit plans generally provided to similarly situated employees in
accordance with the terms thereof from time to time. You will be entitled to and
shall abide by all applicable employment and personnel policies in effect from
time to time.

In recognition of both your continued employment for one year post-close of the
Burr-Brown acquisition, and your agreement to the competitive and
non-solicitation restrictions in your existing Change in Control Severance
Benefit Agreement dated October 30, 1996, the Company will pay you a Special
Payment. The Special Payment ("Special Payment") will be $3.5 million less
compensation paid to you or for your benefit (including base salary, profit
sharing and retirement plan contributions other than your salary deferral
contributions) with respect to the period 1/1/01 through 8/23/01. This Special
Payment will be paid to you in four (4) substantially equal installments payable
on 11/30/00, 2/28/01, 5/31/01 and 8/31/01. In the event you resign before one of
the payment dates listed above, you will not be eligible for the remaining
Special Payment(s). In case of Involuntary termination, however, all remaining
payments will become due and payable to you on the respective payment dates. The
amount of the fourth Special Payment installment may be estimated by the Company
in anticipation of your profit sharing entitlement for the period of 1/1 through
8/23 of year 2001. You agree to reimburse the Company for any overpayment of the
fourth Special Payment no later than 30 days after you are notified of any such
overpayment. The Company agrees to pay you for any underpayment of the Special
Payment no later than 3/31/02. The four Special Payment installments will not be
considered eligible earnings for purposes of TI profit sharing, 401 (k) and
other retirement benefits.

For the portion of the calendar year after August 24, 2001, you will be entitled
to receive a prorated bonus equal to at least 80% of the normal performance
bonus paid in cash to respect of such period to TI's 5th highest paid executive
officer, as will be reported in TI's 2002 proxy statement. This bonus will be
paid during the first quarter of 2002 provided you are employed by the Company
on the payment date. For example, if TI's 5th highest executive officer at the
end of 2001 earned a normal performance bonus of $100,000 for all of 2001, then
you will receive a bonus of at least $28,274 ($100,000 x.8 x 129/365).

For year 2002, you will be entitled to receive a bonus equal to at least 80% of
the normal performance bonus paid in crash in respect of such period to TI's 5th
highest paid executive officer, as will be reported In TI's 2003 proxy
statement. Should you terminate before 8/15/02, you will not be eligible to
receive such bonus. Should your employment be terminated after 8/15/02 but
before the end of the year, your bonus would be prorated to reflect 2002
calendar days employed. This bonus will be paid during the first quarter of
2003. Beginning 1/1/2003, you will be eligible, during your continued
employment, to participate in the Company's normal bonus programs as
commensurate with similarly situated employees.





Upon your agreement to the terms of this letter, we will recommend to the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of TI that you immediately be
awarded a non-qualified option under the Texas Instruments 2000 Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the "Plan") to purchase an aggregate of 250,000 shares of common
stock of TI, par value of $1.00 ("TI Stock'), at an exercise price equal to the
fair market value of TI Stock as of the date of grant. Each stock option shall
have a term of ten (10) years and shall vest 50% on 11/01/01 and 50% on 8/01/02,
provided you remain employed by the Company on each date. The vested portion of
such stock option shall be exercisable for the remainder of the full term
regardless of your termination of employment. The Company agrees that your
option agreement will not include any provisions requiring a repayment to the
company for any profit (spread between Option Price and market price of the TI
Stock on the date of exercise) realized from the exercising of such options. The
stock options will include a non-competition provision for the same period and
with respect to the same companies as set forth in the last paragraph of this
letter. The stock options granted pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to
the remainder of the terms of the Plan. The stock options granted pursuant to
this paragraph will not fully vest upon your termination of employment as a
result of the change of control in connection with the Burr-Brown acquisition.

As a condition of continued employment with the Company, you shall promptly
execute and deliver to the Company an Employee Trade Secrets Information
Acknowledgement, an Assignment of Invention and Company Information Agreement, a
Release of Records and such other documents as TI reasonably may require from
time to time with respect to its new employees or similarly situated employees,
if you have not otherwise done so.

Effective beginning six months after August 24, 2000, should either you or the
Company terminate your employment, such termination will be considered Without
Cause for the purpose of severance calculation as outlined in your Change In
Control Severance Benefit Agreement. It is agreed that the options granted to
you by Burr-Brown, which remain unvested, will vest in full upon such
termination, given that such termination occurs on or before August 23, 2002.
For purposes of clarification. It is agreed that with regard to the acceleration
of vesting of options, any services performed as a consultant will not
constitute employment.

The Change In Control Severance Benefit Agreement dated October 30, 1996 Is
modified as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph. To the extent there
may be a conflict, the terms of this letter will govern. This letter, also,
supercedes and voids your June 20, 2000 letter agreement signed by Tom Engibous.
In addition to your obligations under the aforesaid severance agreement, you
agree not to provide services, directly or indirectly, as an employee or
otherwise for a period of one year following your termination of employment to
Analog Devices, Incorporated, Linear Technology Corporation & Maxim Integrated
Products, Incorporated.


Very truly yours,
