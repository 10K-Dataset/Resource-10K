PART I

ITEM 1. Business.

General Information

Texas Instruments Incorporated (“TI” or the “company,” including
subsidiaries except where the context indicates otherwise) is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and has manufacturing, design or sales operations in more than 25 countries. TI’s largest geographic markets are in the United States, Asia, Japan and
Europe. TI has been in operation since 1930.

The financial
information with respect to TI’s business segments and operations outside the United States, which is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned “Business Segment and Geographic Area Data” on pages 33 through 36 of
TI’s 2002 annual report to stockholders is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report.

Semiconductor

TI is a global semiconductor company and a leading designer and supplier of digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits, the engines driving the
digitization of electronics. Digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits enable a wide range of new products and features for TI’s more than 30,000 customers in commercial, industrial and consumer markets.

TI also is a world leader in the design and manufacturing of other
semiconductor products. Those products include standard logic devices, application-specific integrated circuits, reduced instruction-set computing microprocessors, microcontrollers and digital imaging devices.

The semiconductor business comprised 83% of TI’s 2002 revenue.
TI’s semiconductor products are used in a diverse range of electronic systems, including cellular telephones, personal computers, servers, communications infrastructure equipment, digital cameras, digital audio players, motor controls,
automobiles and digital imaging systems, including projector and television systems. Products are sold to original-equipment manufacturers (OEM), original-design manufacturers (ODM), contract manufacturers and distributors. An OEM designs and sells
under its own brand products that it has manufactured or contracted others to manufacture for it. An ODM designs and manufacturers products for others to sell under their brands. TI’s semiconductor patent portfolio has been established as an
ongoing contributor to semiconductor revenue. In 2002, sales to distributors accounted for approximately 27% of semiconductor revenue. The Nokia group of companies accounted in 2002 for 12% of TI’s revenue.

The semiconductor market is intensely competitive, subject to rapid
technological change and pricing pressures, and requires high rates of investment. TI faces strong competition in all of its semiconductor product lines. The rapid pace of change and technological breakthroughs constantly create new opportunities
for existing competitors and start-ups, which can quickly render existing technologies less valuable. In digital signal processors, TI competes with a number of large and small companies, both U.S.-based and international. New product development
capabilities, applications support, software knowledge and advanced semiconductor process technology are the primary competitive factors in this business.

The market for analog integrated circuits is highly fragmented. TI competes with a number of large and small companies, both U.S.-based and
international. Primary competitive factors in this business are the availability of innovative designs and designers, a broad range of process technologies and applications support and, particularly in the standard products area, price.


Other TI Businesses

In addition to semiconductors,
TI has two other segments. The largest, representing 11% of TI’s 2002 revenue, is Sensors & Controls. This business sells sensors, electrical and electronic controls and radio-frequency identification systems into automotive and industrial
markets. Typically the top supplier in targeted product areas, Sensors & Controls faces strong multinational and regional competitors. The primary competitive factors in this business are product reliability, manufacturing costs and engineering
expertise. The products of the business are sold to OEMs and distributors.

Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) represents 6% of TI’s 2002 revenue and is a leading supplier of graphing and other educational calculators. This business sells primarily through retailers and to schools
through instructional dealers. TI’s principal competitors in this business are U.S.- and Japan-based companies. Technology expertise, price and infrastructure for education and market understanding are primary competitive factors in this
business.

Acquisitions and
Divestitures

From time to time TI considers acquisitions and
divestitures that may strengthen its business portfolio. TI may effect one or more of these transactions at such time or times as it determines to be appropriate. In the second quarter of 2002, TI completed its acquisition of Condat AG, Berlin, a
developer of wireless communication software and platforms for mobile business applications, for a purchase price of approximately $87 million.

Backlog

The dollar amount of backlog of orders believed by TI to be firm was $1057 million as of December 31, 2002 and $1036 million as of December 31, 2001. Backlog orders
are, under certain circumstances, subject to cancellation. A substantial number of orders are shipped during the same quarter in which they are received. Accordingly, the company believes that its backlog as of any particular date may not be
indicative of revenue for any future period.

Raw Materials

TI purchases materials, parts and
supplies from a number of suppliers. The materials, parts and supplies essential to TI’s business are generally available at present and TI believes that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future.

Patents and Trademarks

TI owns many patents in the United States and other countries. The company
has developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio. TI also has several agreements with other companies involving license rights and anticipates that other licenses may be negotiated in the future. TI does not consider its business materially
dependent upon any one patent or patent license, although taken as a whole, the rights of TI and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to TI’s business.

TI owns trademarks that are used in the conduct of its business. These
trademarks are valuable assets, the most important of which are “Texas Instruments” and TI’s corporate monogram.

Research and Development

TI’s research and development expense was $1619 million in 2002, compared with $1598 million in 2001 and $1747 million in 2000. Included is a charge for the


value of acquisition-related purchased in-process research and development of $1 million in 2002, zero in 2001, and
$112 million in 2000.

Seasonality

TI’s revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal
variation. In particular, E&PS is subject to seasonal variation, experiencing its strongest revenue and operating results in the second and third quarters as retailers stock for the back-to-school season.

Employees

At December 31, 2002, the company had 34,589 employees.

Cautionary Statements Regarding Future Results of
Operations

You should read the following cautionary statements in
conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of TI’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings. These cautionary statements are intended to
highlight certain factors that may affect the financial condition and results of operations of TI and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies with broad international operations, such as TI. Like other
companies, TI is susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the United States or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and performance of TI or its customers. Similarly, the price of TI’s securities is subject to volatility due to
fluctuations in general market conditions, differences in TI’s results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community and other factors beyond TI’s control.

Further Weakening or Delayed Recovery in the Semiconductor Market May
Adversely Affect TI’s Performance.

TI’s
semiconductor business represents its largest business segment and the principal source of its revenue. The semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns. After strong growth in 1999 and 2000, the
semiconductor market declined significantly in 2001 and grew only slightly in 2002. Further weakening or delayed recovery in the semiconductor market could adversely affect TI’s results of operations and have an adverse effect on the market
price of its securities. In particular, TI’s strategic focus in this business is on the development and marketing of digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits. The results of TI’s operations may be adversely affected in the
future if demand for digital signal processors or analog integrated circuits decreases or if these markets or key end-equipment markets such as telecommunications and computers grow at a significantly slower pace than expected by management.

TI’s Margins May Vary over Time.

TI’s profit margins may be adversely affected in the
future by a number of factors, including decreases in its shipment volume, reductions in, or obsolescence of, its inventory and shifts in its product mix. In addition, the highly competitive market environment in which the company operates might
adversely affect pricing for the company’s products. Because TI owns most of its manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of the company’s operating costs are fixed. These costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or the
company’s utilization of its manufacturing capacity, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result.


The Technology
Industry Is Characterized by Rapid Technological Change That Requires TI to Develop New Technologies and Products.

TI’s results of operations depend in part upon its ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly
changing technological environment. TI requires significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that, in turn, may result in shortened product lifecycles. Moreover, expenditures for technology and
product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured. As a result, there can be no assurance that TI will successfully develop and market these new products, that the products TI does develop
and market will be well received by customers or that TI will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products.

TI Faces Substantial Competition That Requires TI to Respond Rapidly to Product Development and Pricing Pressures.

TI faces intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in
which it operates. TI expects that the level of this competition will increase in the future from large, established semiconductor and related product companies, as well as from emerging companies serving niche markets also served by TI. Certain of
TI’s competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against those products of TI that currently offer technological and/or price advantages over competitive
products. Competition results in price and product development pressures, which may result in reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that TI is unable to match price declines or technological, product, applications
support, software or manufacturing advances of its competitors.

TI’s Performance Depends in Part upon Its Ability to Enforce Its Intellectual Property Rights and to Develop or License New Intellectual Property.

TI benefits from royalties generated from various license agreements that will generally be in effect through the year
2005. Access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of TI’s intellectual property portfolio. Future royalty revenue depends on the strength of TI’s portfolio and enforcement efforts, and on the sales and financial
stability of TI’s licensees. Additionally, the consolidation of TI’s licensees may negatively affect TI’s royalty revenue. TI actively enforces and protects its intellectual property rights, but there can be no assurance that
TI’s efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of the protected technology. Moreover, there can be no assurance that, as TI’s business expands into new areas, TI will be able to independently develop the
technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct its business or that it can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. TI may have to rely increasingly on licensed technology from others. To the extent that TI relies
on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain all of the licenses it desires in the future on terms it considers reasonable or at all.

A Decline in Demand in Certain End-User Markets Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Demand for TI’s
Products and Results of Operations.

TI’s customer
base includes companies in a wide range of industries, but TI generates a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the telecommunications and computer-related industries. Within these industries, a large portion of TI revenue is
generated by the sale of digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits to customers in the cellular phone, personal computer and communications infrastructure markets. Decline in one or several of these end-user markets could have a
material adverse effect on the demand for TI’s products and its results of operations.


TI’s Global
Manufacturing, Design and Sales Activities Subject It to Risks Associated with Legal, Political, Economic or Other Changes.

TI operates in more than 25 countries worldwide, and in 2002 more than 76% of its revenue came from sales to locations outside the United States.
Operating internationally exposes TI to changes in export controls and other laws or policies, as well as the general economic conditions, security risks and possible disruptions in transportation networks, of the various countries in which it
operates, which could result in an adverse effect on TI’s business operations in such countries and its results of operations. Also, as discussed in more detail on pages 19 and 49 of TI’s 2002 annual report to stockholders, TI uses forward
currency exchange contracts to minimize the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the company’s non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Nevertheless, in periods when the U.S. dollar strengthens in
relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which TI transacts business, the remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on TI’s non-U.S. business.

The Loss of or Significant Curtailment of Purchases by Any of TI’s Largest Customers Could Adversely Affect
TI’s Results of Operations.

While TI generates
revenue from thousands of customers worldwide, the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of its top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these
customers, or the timing of customer inventory adjustments may adversely affect TI’s results of operations.

TI’s Performance Depends on the Availability of Raw Materials and Critical Manufacturing Equipment.

Limited or delayed access to key raw materials used in the manufacturing
process or critical manufacturing equipment could adversely impact TI’s results of operations. Additionally, the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect TI’s
results of operations.

TI’s Continued Success
Depends in Part on Its Ability to Retain and Recruit a Sufficient Number of Qualified Employees in a Competitive Environment.

TI’s continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and
staff personnel. Experienced personnel in the electronics industry are in high demand and competition for their skills is intense. There can be no assurance that TI will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that it requires.

Fluctuations in the Market Values of the Company’s
Investments and in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect TI’s Results of Operations.

TI has investments of various types and maturities. Most investments are equity investments in publicly traded companies, the values of which are subject to market price volatility. TI may recognize in earnings
the decline in the value of its investments. For information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of the company’s investments and interest rates, see the section titled “Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk” on pages 49 and 50 in TI’s 2002 annual report to stockholders. Furthermore, TI’s equity investments in both publicly traded companies and private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment
capital. These investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize.

ITEM 2. Properties.

TI’s principal executive offices are located at 12500 TI Boulevard, Dallas, Texas. TI owns and leases facilities in the United States and 16 other countries
for manufacturing, design and related purposes. The following table indicates the general location of TI’s principal manufacturing and design operations and the business segments that make major use of them. Except as otherwise indicated, these
facilities are owned by TI.

(1)

Certain facilities or portions thereof in Dallas and Sherman are leased to Raytheon Company or Raytheon-related entities in connection with the sale in 1997 of TI’s
defense systems and electronics business.

(2)

Leased.

(3)

Approximately half of this site is owned on leased land; the remainder is leased.

(4)

Owned on leased land.

TI’s facilities in the United States contained approximately 15,400,000 square feet as of December 31, 2002, of which approximately 2,500,000
square feet were leased. TI’s facilities outside the United States contained approximately 5,900,000 square feet as of December 31, 2002, of which approximately 1,500,000 square feet were leased.

TI believes that its existing properties are in good condition and
suitable for the manufacture of its products. At the end of 2002, the company occupied substantially all of the space in its facilities.


Leases covering
TI’s leased facilities expire at varying dates generally within the next 10 years. TI anticipates no difficulty in either retaining occupancy through lease renewals, month-to-month occupancy or purchases of leased facilities, or replacing the
leased facilities with equivalent facilities.

ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings.

Italian government auditors have substantially completed a review, conducted in the ordinary course, of approximately $250 million of grants from the Italian government to TI’s former memory operations in
Italy. The auditors have raised a number of issues relating to compliance with grant requirements and the eligibility of specific expenses for the grants. The Ministry of Industry is responsible for reviewing the auditor’s findings. Depending
on the Ministry’s decision, the review may result in a demand from the Italian government that TI repay a portion of the grants. The company believes that the grants were obtained and used in compliance with applicable law and contractual
obligations. TI does not expect aggregate repayments to the Italian government, if any, to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

TI is involved in various proceedings conducted by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and certain other
governmental environmental agencies regarding clean-up of contaminated sites. These proceedings are being coordinated with the agencies and, in certain cases, with other potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”). Although the factual
situations and the progress of each of these matters differ, the company believes that the amount of its liability will not have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
