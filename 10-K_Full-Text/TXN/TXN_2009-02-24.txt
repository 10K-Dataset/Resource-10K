PART I

ITEM 1. Business.

Company
Overview

At Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI), we
design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and
manufacturers all over the world. We began operations in 1930 and are
incorporated in Delaware. We are headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and have
design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries. We have
four segments: Analog, Embedded Processing, Wireless and Other. We expect Analog
and Embedded Processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead, and
we therefore focus our resources on these segments.

We were the world’s fourth largest
semiconductor company in 2008 as measured by revenue, according to preliminary
estimates from an external source. Additionally, we sell calculators and related
products.

Financial information with respect to our
segments and our operations outside the United States is contained in the note
to the financial statements captioned “Segment and geographic area data” on
pages 31 and 32 of TI’s 2008 annual report to stockholders. It is
incorporated herein by reference to such annual report.

Product
Information

Semiconductors are electronic components
that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and
equipment. Semiconductors come in two basic forms: individual transistors and
integrated circuits (generally known as “chips”) that combine different
transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit.

Our semiconductors are
used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying
signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power,
processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution. Our portfolio
includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment.

We sell two general categories of
semiconductor products: custom and standard. A custom product is designed for a
specific customer for a specific application, is sold only to that customer and
is typically sold directly to the customer. A standard product is designed for
use by many customers and/or many applications and is generally sold through
both distribution and direct channels. Standard products include both
proprietary and commodity products.

Additional information regarding each
segment’s products follows.

Analog

Analog
semiconductors change real-world signals – such as sound, temperature, pressure
or images – by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a
stream of digital data so the signals can be processed by other semiconductors,
such as digital signal processors (DSPs). Analog semiconductors are also used to
manage power distribution and consumption. Sales from our Analog segment
accounted for about 40 percent of our revenue in 2008. The worldwide market for
analog semiconductors was about $36 billion in 2008. According to external
sources, we have about a 12 percent share in the fragmented analog semiconductor
market, which is a leading position. We believe that we are well positioned to
increase our share over time.

During 2008, we
discussed our Analog business by reference to high-performance analog and
high-volume analog & logic.

High-performance analog products: These include standard analog
semiconductors, such as amplifiers, data converters, low-power radio frequency
devices, and interface and power management semiconductors (our standard analog
portfolio includes more than 20,000 products), that we market to many different
customers (nearly 80,000) who use them in a wide range of products across the
industrial, communications, computing and consumer markets. High-performance
analog products generally have long life cycles, often 10 to 20
years.

High-volume
analog & logic products: These include two product types. The first,
high-volume analog, includes products for specific applications, including
custom products for specific customers. The life cycles of our high-volume
analog products are generally shorter than those of our high-performance analog
products. End markets for high-volume analog products include communications,
automotive, computing and many consumer electronics products. The second product
type, standard linear and logic, includes commodity products marketed to many
different customers for many different applications.


Beginning with
the first quarter of 2009, we will discuss power management semiconductors as a
separate category of Analog products, separating it from the high-performance
category.

Embedded
Processing

Our Embedded
Processing products include our DSPs (other than DSPs specific to our Wireless
segment) and microcontrollers. DSPs perform mathematical computations almost
instantaneously to process and improve digital data. Microcontrollers are
microprocessors that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for
electronic equipment. Sales of Embedded Processing products accounted for about
15 percent of our revenue in 2008. The worldwide market for embedded processors
was about $17 billion in 2008. According to external sources, we have about a 10
percent share in this fragmented market, and we believe we are well positioned
to increase our share over time.

An important
characteristic of Embedded Processing products is that our customers often
invest their own research and development (R&D) to write software that
operates on our products. This investment tends to increase the length of our
customer relationships because customers prefer to re-use software from one
product generation to the next. We make and sell standard, or catalog, Embedded
Processing products used in many different applications and custom Embedded
Processing products used in specific applications, such as communications
infrastructure equipment and automotive.

Wireless

Cell phones
require a modem or “baseband” to connect to the wireless carrier’s network. Many
of today’s advanced cell phones also require an applications processor to run
the phone’s software and services, and semiconductors to enable connectivity to
Bluetooth

®

devices, WiFi networks or GPS location services. We
design, make and sell products to satisfy each of these requirements. Wireless
products are typically sold in high volumes and our Wireless portfolio includes
both standard (or merchant) products and custom products. Sales of Wireless
products accounted for about 25 percent of our revenue in 2008, and a
significant portion of our Wireless sales were to a single customer.

As wireless
communications have proliferated, consumers have demanded capabilities beyond
voice. Smartphones (phones that contain email, media, games and computing
capability) represent one of the fastest growing wireless markets. These phones
tend to include many semiconductor products. Major handset manufacturers are
actively pursuing the smartphone market and increasingly focusing their R&D
on applications and services. As a result, we believe customer demand for
applications processors will grow as handset manufacturers seek to differentiate
their products by providing software and a unique user experience. Our
OMAP

TM

product line has a leading
position in the applications processor market and is used by most of the top
handset manufacturers.

Our Wireless
segment has been shifting focus from baseband chips, a market with shrinking
competitive barriers and slowing growth rates, to applications processors, a
market we expect will grow faster than the baseband market. Consistent with this
shift in market focus, we are concentrating our Wireless investments on our
applications processors and connectivity products. We continue to sell custom
baseband products but have discontinued further development of merchant baseband
products.

Other

Our Other
segment includes revenue from smaller semiconductor product lines and handheld
graphing and scientific calculators, and from royalties received for our
patented technology that we license to other electronics companies. The
semiconductor products in our Other segment include DLP

®

products
(primarily used to create high-definition images for business and home theater
projectors, televisions and movie projectors), reduced-instruction set computing
(RISC) microprocessors (designed to provide very fast computing and often
implemented in servers) and custom semiconductors known as application-specific
integrated circuits (ASICs). This segment accounted for about 20 percent of our
revenue in 2008.


Applications for Our
Products

The table below lists the major end
markets that use our products and the approximate percentage of our product
revenue that the market represents. The chart also lists the most frequent
applications and our products used within these key markets.


Market Characteristics

Product cycle

The global semiconductor market is
characterized by constant, though generally incremental, advances in product
designs and manufacturing methods. Chip prices and manufacturing costs tend to
decline over time as manufacturing methods and product life cycles mature.
Typically, new chips are produced in limited quantities at first and then ramp
to high-volume production over time.

Market cycle

The “semiconductor cycle” is an important
concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply, with relatively stable
demand. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods
of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing
capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand
and/or excess manufacturing capacity. This cycle is affected by the significant
time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing
facilities.

Although there are similarities with past
cycles, we do not believe the market environment in the second half of 2008 and
early 2009 is simply a surplus-driven inventory correction. Instead, we believe
it is a broad economic slowdown in which consumer and industrial consumption has
dramatically weakened and likely will weaken further.

Seasonality

Our revenue and operating results are
subject to some seasonal variation. Sales of our semiconductor products are
seasonally weaker in the first quarter than in other quarters, particularly for
products sold into cell phones and consumer electronics applications that have
stronger sales later in the year as manufacturers prepare for the holiday
selling season. Calculator revenue is tied to the U.S. back-to-school season
and, as a result, is at its highest in the second and third quarters. Royalty
revenue is not always uniform or predictable, in part due to the performance of
our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the
expiration and renewal of existing agreements.

Competitive landscape

In each segment, we face significant
global competition from numerous large and small companies, including both
broad-based suppliers and niche suppliers. We believe that competitive
performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors,
including the breadth of a company’s product line, technological innovation,
technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, price and scale. With
expertise in both digital signal processing and analog at the system level, we
believe we are capable of providing best-in-class products that integrate both
technologies onto a single chip. In addition, our ability to deliver integrated
solutions and system-level knowledge allows our customers to create more
advanced systems and products and bring their products to market
sooner.

The primary competitive factors in the
Analog market include design proficiency, a diverse product portfolio to meet
wide-ranging customer needs, manufacturing process technologies that provide
differentiated levels of performance and manufacturing expertise. Our primary
Analog competitors include Analog Devices, Inc.; Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.;
Infineon Technologies AG; Intersil Corporation; Linear Technology Corporation;
Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.; National Semiconductor Corporation; NXP B.V.;
and STMicroelectronics NV.

The primary competitive factors for our
Embedded Processing products are the ability to design and cost-effectively
manufacture products, system-level knowledge about targeted end markets,
installed base of software, software expertise, applications support and a
product’s performance and power characteristics. Primary competitors of our
Embedded Processing segment include Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.; Infineon
Technologies AG; NEC Electronics and Renesas Technology Corp.

The primary competitive factors for our
Wireless products are the ability to design and cost-effectively manufacture
products, system-level knowledge about targeted end markets, installed base of
software, software expertise, applications support and a product’s performance
and power characteristics. Primary Wireless competitors include Broadcom Corp.;
Freescale

Semiconductor, Inc.; Infineon
Technologies AG; Marvell Technology Group, Ltd.; QUALCOMM Incorporated and
STMicroelectronics NV.


Manufacturing

Semiconductor manufacturing begins with
the wafer fabrication manufacturing process: a sequence of photo-lithographic
and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices
on a thin silicon wafer. Each device on the wafer is tested and the wafer is cut
into pieces called chips. Each chip is assembled into a package that then may be
retested. The entire process typically requires between twelve and eighteen
weeks and takes place in highly specialized facilities.

We own and operate semiconductor
manufacturing sites in North America, Asia and Europe. These facilities include
high-volume wafer fabrication plants and assembly/test sites. Our facilities
require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets
once in operation. Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a
significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. In general, these costs do
not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of capacity and
can adversely affect our profit margins as a result. Conversely, as product
demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over
increased output, potentially benefiting our profit margins.

Most of our Analog semiconductors require
a lower level of capital investment in manufacturing and equipment than is
needed for equivalent production levels of our Embedded Processing and Wireless
semiconductors, which are manufactured using advanced logic wafer manufacturing
equipment. While analog chips benefit from unique, proprietary wafer
manufacturing processes, these processes can be applied using older, less
expensive equipment. In addition, these processes and equipment remain usable
for much longer than the manufacturing processes and equipment required for
advanced logic wafer manufacturing.

To supplement our internal advanced logic
wafer fabrication capacity, maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and
minimize our overall capital expenditures, our wafer manufacturing strategy
utilizes the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries. Our
strategy involves installing internal wafer fabrication capacity to a level we
believe will remain fully utilized over the equipment’s useful lifetime and then
outsourcing remaining capacity needs to foundries. In 2008, external foundries
provided about 50 percent of the fabricated wafers for our advanced logic
manufacturing needs, but during the fourth quarter of 2008, we significantly
reduced our foundry purchases. We expect the proportion of our advanced logic
wafers provided by foundries will increase over time. We expect to maintain
sufficient internal wafer fabrication capacity to meet substantially all our
analog production needs.

In addition to using foundries to
supplement our wafer fabrication capacity, we selectively use subcontractors to
supplement our assembly/test capacity. We generally use subcontractors for
assembly/test of products that would be less cost-efficient to complete in-house
(e.g., relatively low-volume products that are unlikely to keep internal
equipment fully utilized), or in the event demand temporarily exceeds our
internal capacity. We believe we often have a cost advantage in maintaining
internal assembly/test capacity. Accordingly, we have nearly completed an
environmentally efficient assembly/test facility in the Philippines, and the
facility is in the initial stages of production.

This internal/external manufacturing
strategy is designed to reduce the level of our required capital expenditures,
and thereby reduce our subsequent levels of depreciation. Expected end results
include less fluctuation in our profit margins due to changing product demand,
and lower cash requirements for expanding and updating our manufacturing
capabilities. As our internal manufacturing efforts shift to a higher percentage
of analog products, an increasing proportion of our capital expenditures is
devoted to assembly/test facilities and equipment. This is primarily due to the
lower capital needs of analog wafer manufacturing equipment.

Inventory

While our inventory practices differ by
product, we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our
expectations of customer demand.

For custom semiconductor products, where
the risk of obsolescence is higher, we carry lower levels of inventory when
possible. These products have a single customer, are sold in high volumes and
have comparatively shorter life cycles. Life cycles of these products are often
determined by end-equipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24
months.

For standard semiconductor products, where
the risk of obsolescence is low, we generally carry higher levels of inventory.
These products usually have many customers and long life cycles, and are often
ordered in small quantities. Standard product inventory is sometimes held in
unfinished wafer form, giving us greater flexibility to meet final package and
test configurations.


As a result of the following trends, we
now tend to carry relatively higher levels of inventory than in past years:
standard products have become a larger part of our portfolio; we have increased
consignment programs with our largest customers; and our distributors now carry
relatively less inventory on average than in the past.

We manage calculator inventory consistent
with expected seasonality.

Design Centers

Our design centers provide design,
engineering and product application support as well as after-sales customer
service. The design centers are strategically located around the world to take
advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key
customers.

Customers

Our products are sold to original
equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), contract
manufacturers and distributors. (An OEM designs and sells products under its own
brand that it manufactures in-house or has manufactured by others. An ODM
designs and manufactures products for other companies, which then sell those
products under their own brand.) Our largest single customer in 2008 was an OEM,
the Nokia group of companies. Sales to Nokia were about 20 percent of our
revenue in 2008, and a majority of this revenue was in our Wireless
segment.

Sales and Distribution

We market and sell our semiconductor
products through a direct sales force, distributors and authorized third-party
sales representatives. We have sales or marketing offices in over 30 countries
worldwide and have expanded our sales networks in the emerging markets of China,
India and Eastern Europe. Distributors located around the world account for
about 30 percent of our revenue, and a majority of our revenue from many
standard products. Our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and
sell directly to a wide range of customers. They also sell products from our
competitors. Our distribution network holds a mix of distributor-owned and
TI-consigned inventory. Over time, we expect this mix will shift more toward
consignment. We sell our calculator products primarily through retailers and
instructional dealers.

Acquisitions, Divestitures and
Investments

From time to time we consider acquisitions
and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio. We
also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies. Investments
are focused primarily on next-generation technologies and markets strategic to
us.

Backlog

We define backlog as of a particular date
as firm purchase orders with a customer-requested delivery date within a
specified length of time. As customer requirements and industry conditions
change, orders may be, under certain circumstances, subject to cancellation or
modification of terms such as pricing, quantity or delivery date. Customer order
placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business
needs and capabilities, as well as industry supply and capacity considerations.
Accordingly, our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue
for any future period. We ship a substantial number of orders in the quarter in
which they are received. Our backlog of orders was $0.86 billion at December 31,
2008, and $1.50 billion at December 31, 2007.

Raw Materials

We purchase materials, parts and supplies
from a number of suppliers. In some cases we purchase such items from sole
source suppliers. The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business
are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts
and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future.

Intellectual Property

We own many patents, and have many patent
applications pending, in the United States and other countries in fields
relating to our business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent
portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio. We also have agreements
with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other
license agreements may be negotiated in the future. In general, our license
agreements have multi-year terms and may be renewed after renegotiation.


Our semiconductor patent portfolio is an
ongoing contributor to our revenue. We do not consider our business materially
dependent upon any one patent or patent license, although taken as a whole, our
rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are
important to our business.

We often participate in industry
initiatives to set technical standards. Our competitors may also participate in
the same initiatives. Participation in these initiatives may require us to
license our patents to other companies.

We own trademarks that are used in the
conduct of our business. These trademarks are valuable assets, the most
important of which are “Texas Instruments” and our corporate monogram. Other
valuable trademarks include OMAP

TM

and
DLP

®

.

Research and Development

Our primary area of R&D investment is
Analog and Embedded Processing products. We conduct most of our R&D
internally. However, we also closely engage with a wide range of external
industry consortia and universities and collaborate with our foundry suppliers
on semiconductor manufacturing technology.

From time to time we may terminate R&D
projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed
product. We do not expect that all of our R&D projects will result in
products that are ultimately released for sale, or that our projects will
contribute significant revenue until at least a few years following
completion.

Our R&D expense was $1.94 billion in
2008, compared with $2.14 billion in 2007 and $2.20 billion in 2006.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.

You should read the following Risk Factors
in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials
incorporated by reference in these filings. These Risk Factors are intended to
highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of
operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply
to companies like TI with broad international operations. Like other companies,
we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the United States or abroad
that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the
performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our securities is subject
to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial
results that do not meet our and/or the investment community’s expectations,
changes in our and/or the investment community’s expectations for our future
results and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Cyclicality
in the Semiconductor Market May Affect Our Performance.

Semiconductor products are the principal
source of our revenue. The semiconductor market historically has been cyclical
and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product
demand. These changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations,
and on the market price of our securities. The results of our operations may be
adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or
if these markets or key end-equipment markets such as communications, consumer
electronics, computing, automotive and industrial grow at a significantly slower
pace than management expects.

Our Margins
May Vary over Time.

Our profit margins may be adversely
affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our
shipment volume, reductions in, or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in
our product mix. In addition, the highly competitive market environment in which
we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products. Because we own much
of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs are
fixed. In general, these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand
or utilization of manufacturing capacity, and can adversely affect profit
margins as a result.

The
Technology Industry Is Characterized by Rapid Technological Change That Requires
Us to Develop New Technologies and Products.

Our results of operations depend in part
upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative
products in a rapidly changing technological environment. We require significant
capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer
demands that, in turn, may result in shortened product life cycles. Moreover,
expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before
the commercial viability for such developments can be assured. As a result,
there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new
products. There also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market
will be well received by customers, nor that we will realize a return on the
capital expended to develop such products.


We Face
Substantial Competition That Requires Us to Respond Rapidly to Product
Development and Pricing Pressures.

We face intense technological and pricing
competition in the markets in which we operate. We expect this competition will
continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving
niche markets. Certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial,
technical and management resources to develop and market products that may
compete favorably against our products. The price and product development
pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and
lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price
declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support,
software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors.

Our
Performance Depends in Part on Our Ability to Enforce Our Intellectual Property
Rights and to Develop and License New Intellectual Property.

Access to worldwide markets depends in
part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio. There can
be no assurance that, as our business expands into new areas, we will be able to
independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct
our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property
rights of others. To the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from
others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all
or on terms we consider reasonable. The lack of a necessary license could expose
us to claims for damages and/or injunction from third parties, as well as claims
for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have contractually
agreed to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement
claims.

With regard to our own intellectual
property, we actively enforce and protect our rights. However, there can be no
assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or
improper use of our protected technology.

We benefit from royalty revenue generated
from various patent license agreements. The amount of such revenue depends in
part on negotiations with new licensees, and with existing licensees in
connection with renewals of their licenses. There is no guarantee that such
negotiations will be successful. Future royalty revenue also depends on the
strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts,
and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees. Additionally,
consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue.
Royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable, in part due
to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license
agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements.

A Decline in
Demand in Certain End-User Markets Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Demand for Our Products and Results of Operations.

Our customer base includes companies in a
wide range of industries, but we generate a significant amount of revenue from
sales to customers in the communications- and computer-related industries.
Within these industries, a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales
to customers in the cell phone, personal computer and communications
infrastructure markets. Decline in one or several of these end-user markets
could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our
results of operations and financial condition.

Our Global
Manufacturing, Design and Sales Activities Subject Us to Risks Associated with
Legal, Political, Economic or Other Changes.

We have facilities in more than 30
countries worldwide, and in 2008 more than 85 percent of our revenue came from
sales to locations outside the United States. Operating internationally exposes
us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies, as well as
political and economic conditions, security risks, health conditions and
possible disruptions in transportation networks of the various countries in
which we operate. Any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business
operations and our financial results. Also, as discussed in more detail on
page 47 of our 2008 annual report to stockholders, we use forward currency
exchange contracts to reduce the adverse earnings impact exchange rate
fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures.
Nevertheless, in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in
relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business, the
remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition.

Our Results
of Operations Could be Affected by Natural Events in the Locations in Which We
or Our Customers or Suppliers Operate.

We have manufacturing and other operations
in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and
geological events that could disrupt operations. In addition, our suppliers and
customers also have operations in such locations. A natural disaster that
results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our
customers or suppliers, may adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.


The Loss of
or Significant Curtailment of Purchases by Any of Our Largest Customers Could
Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations.

While we generate revenue from thousands
of customers worldwide, the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by
one or more of our top customers (including curtailments due to a change in the
design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or
the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments) may adversely
affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Incorrect
Forecasts of Customer Demand Could Adversely Affect Our Results of
Operations.

Our ability to match inventory and
production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to
meet a quarter’s revenue forecast. In addition, when responding to customers’
requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture products based on
forecasts of customers’ demands. These forecasts are based on multiple
assumptions. If we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold
inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins
and adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition.

Our
Performance Depends on the Availability and Cost of Raw Materials, Utilities,
Critical Manufacturing Equipment, Manufacturing Processes and Third-Party
Manufacturing Services.

Our manufacturing processes and critical
manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials and utilities be
available. Limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could
adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, the inability to
timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing
equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. We subcontract a
portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated
circuits. We also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic
manufacturing process technology development. A limited number of third parties
perform these functions, and we do not have long-term contracts with all of
them. Reliance on these third parties involves risks, including possible
shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, the third parties’ inability to
develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely,
cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties
imposing increased costs on us.

Our Results
of Operations Could be Affected by Changes in Taxation.

We have facilities in more than 30
countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a
number of taxing authorities. Tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we
operate. Our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or
decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or
more countries, or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing
authorities in countries in which we operate.

In addition, we are subject to laws and
regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been
earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. Changes in these
laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn
income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. We have deferred
tax assets on our balance sheet. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations
could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also
affect our results of operations. Each quarter we forecast our tax liability
based on our forecast of our performance for the year. If that performance
forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability will change.

Our Results
of Operations Could be Affected by Changes in the Financial
Markets.

We maintain bank accounts, multi-year
revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the
financing needs of the company. Our ability to fund our daily operations, invest
in our business, and make strategic acquisitions requires continuous access to
our bank and investment accounts, as well as access to our bank credit lines
that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity
through short-term bank loans. If we are unable to access these accounts and
credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our
results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Similarly, such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the
capital markets or redeem our investments. If our customers or suppliers are
unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may
receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect
accounts receivable or access needed technology.


Our Results
of Operations Could be Affected by Warranty Claims, Product Recalls or Product
Liability.

We could be subject to warranty or product
liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could
lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards. The
risk of a significant claim is generally greater for products used in health and
safety applications. In the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs
if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. We maintain
product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will
be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. In addition, it is
possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a TI part. In
such instances, we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. Costs or
payments we may make in connection with warranty, epidemic failure and delivery
claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.

Our
Continued Success Depends in Part on Our Ability to Retain and Recruit a
Sufficient Number of Qualified Employees in a Competitive
Environment.

Our continued success depends in part on
the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, including technical,
marketing, management and staff personnel. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we
require.

Portions of the facilities are

(2)

Leased.

Our facilities in the United States
contained approximately 14.1 million square feet at December 31, 2008, of which
approximately 1.7 million square feet were leased. Our facilities outside the
United States contained approximately 6.2 million square feet at December 31,
2008, of which approximately 1.5 million square feet were leased.

At the end of 2008, we occupied
substantially all of the space in our facilities.

Leases covering our currently occupied
leased facilities expire at varying dates generally within the next 8 years. We
believe our current properties are suitable and adequate for both their intended
purpose and our current and foreseeable future needs.


ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings.

We are involved in various inquiries and
proceedings regarding laws and regulations related to the protection of the
environment. These matters involve various parties, including government
agencies and, in certain cases, other potentially responsible parties. Although
the factual situations and the progress of each of these matters differ, we
believe that the amount of our liability, if any, will not have a material
adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

The Internal Revenue Code requires that
companies disclose in their Form 10-K whether they have been required to pay
penalties to the Internal Revenue Service for certain transactions that have
been identified by the IRS as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance
purpose. We have not been required to pay any such penalties.

“Safe Harbor” Statement under the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:

This report includes forward-looking
statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking
statements generally can be identified by phrases such as TI or its management
“believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “foresees,” “forecasts,” “estimates” or
other words or phrases of similar import. Similarly, statements herein that
describe TI’s business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals
also are forward-looking statements. All such forward-looking statements are
subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those in forward-looking statements.

We urge you to carefully consider the
following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from the expectations of TI or its management:

Market demand for semiconductors, particularly in
  key markets such as communications, entertainment electronics and
  computing;

TI’s ability to maintain or improve profit
  margins, including its ability to utilize its manufacturing facilities at
  sufficient levels to cover its fixed operating costs, in an intensely
  competitive and cyclical industry;

TI’s ability to develop, manufacture and market
  innovative products in a rapidly changing technological
  environment;

TI’s ability to compete in products and prices in
  an intensely competitive industry;

TI’s ability to maintain and enforce a strong
  intellectual property portfolio and obtain needed licenses from third
  parties;

Expiration of license agreements between TI and
  its patent licensees, and market conditions reducing royalty payments to
  TI;

Economic, social and political conditions in the
  countries in which TI, its customers or its suppliers operate, including
  security risks, health conditions, possible disruptions in transportation
  networks and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

Natural events such as severe weather and
  earthquakes in the locations in which TI, its customers or its suppliers
  operate;

Availability and cost of raw materials, utilities,
  manufacturing equipment, third-party manufacturing services and manufacturing
  technology;

Changes in the tax rate applicable to TI as the
  result of changes in tax law, the jurisdictions in which profits are
  determined to be earned and taxed, the outcome of tax audits and the ability
  to realize deferred tax assets;

Losses or curtailments of purchases from key
  customers and the timing and amount of distributor and other customer
  inventory adjustments;

Customer demand that differs from our
  forecasts;


The financial impact of inadequate or excess TI
  inventory that results from demand that differs from
  projections;

The ability of TI and its customers and suppliers
  to access their bank accounts and lines of credit or otherwise access the
  capital markets;

Product liability or warranty claims, claims based
  on epidemic or delivery failure or recalls by TI customers for a product
  containing a TI part;

TI’s ability to recruit and retain skilled
  personnel; and

Timely implementation of new manufacturing
  technologies, installation of manufacturing equipment and the ability to
  obtain needed third-party foundry and assembly/test subcontract
  services.

For a more detailed discussion of these
factors see the Risk Factors discussion in Item 1A of this report. The
forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date
of this report and TI undertakes no obligation to update the forward-looking
statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
