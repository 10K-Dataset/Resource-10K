ITEM 1.   Business.

General Information
- -------------------

Texas Instruments Incorporated ("TI" or the "company," including subsidiaries
except where the context indicates otherwise) is headquartered in Dallas,
Texas, and has manufacturing, design or sales operations in 27 countries.
TI's largest geographic markets are in the United States, Asia, Japan and
Europe.  TI has been in operation since 1930.

The financial information with respect to TI's business segments and
operations outside the United States, which is contained in the note to the
financial statements captioned "Business Segment and Geographic Area Data" on
pages B-23 through B-25 of TI's proxy statement for the 2000 annual meeting of
stockholders, is incorporated herein by reference to such proxy statement.


Semiconductor
- -------------

TI is a global semiconductor company and the world's leading designer and
supplier of digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits, the
engines driving the digitization of electronics.  These two types of
semiconductor products work together in digital electronic devices such as
digital cellular phones.  Analog technology converts analog signals like
sound, light, temperature and pressure into the digital language of zeros and
ones, which can then be processed in real-time by a digital signal processor.
Analog integrated circuits also translate digital signals back to analog.
Digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits enable a wide range of
new products and features for TI's more than 30,000 customers in commercial,
industrial and consumer markets.

TI also is a world leader in the design and manufacturing of other
semiconductor products.  Those products include standard logic, application-
specific integrated circuits, reduced instruction-set computing
microprocessors, microcontrollers and digital imaging devices.

The semiconductor business comprised 84% of TI's 1999 revenues.  TI's
semiconductor products are used in a diverse range of electronic systems,
including digital cell phones, computers, printers, hard disk drives, modems,
networking equipment, digital cameras and video recorders, motor controls,
autos, and home appliances.  Products are sold primarily to original-equipment
manufacturers and through distributors.  TI's semiconductor patent portfolio
has been established as an ongoing contributor to semiconductor revenues.
Revenues generated from sales to TI's top four semiconductor customers
accounted for approximately 23% of total semiconductor revenues in 1999.

The semiconductor business is intensely competitive, subject to rapid
technological change and pricing pressures, and requires high rates of
investment.  TI is the leading supplier of digital signal processors and
analog integrated circuits, yet faces strong competition in all of its
semiconductor

                                       -2-

product lines.  The rapid pace of change and technological breakthroughs
constantly create new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups,
which can quickly render existing technologies less valuable.

In digital signal processors, TI competes with a growing number of large and
small companies, both U.S.-based and international.  New product development
capabilities, applications support, software knowledge and advanced technology
are the primary competitive factors in this business.

The market for analog integrated circuits is highly fragmented.  TI competes
with many large and small companies, both U.S.-based and international.
Primary competitive factors in this business are the availability of innovative
designs and designers, a broad range of process technologies and applications
support and, particularly in the standard products area, price.


A Decline in the Market for Digital Signal Processors or Analog Integrated
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Circuits Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on TI's Results of Operations.
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TI has undertaken a strategy that focuses on developing and marketing digital
signal processors and analog integrated circuits.  TI has divested certain of
its operations and acquired others and invested its resources with the view of
furthering its focus on these products.  While TI believes that focusing its
efforts on digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits offers the
best opportunity for TI to achieve its strategic goals and that TI has
developed, and will continue to develop, a wide range of innovative and
technologically advanced products, the results of TI's operations may be
adversely affected in the future if the demand for digital signal processors
and analog integrated circuits decreases or this market grows at a pace
significantly less than that projected by management.


Other TI Businesses
- -------------------

In addition to semiconductors, TI has two other principal segments.  The
largest, representing 11% of TI's 1999 revenues, is Materials & Controls (M&C).
This business sells electrical and electronic controls, electronic connectors,
sensors, radio-frequency identification systems and clad metals into commercial
and industrial markets. Typically the top supplier in targeted product areas,
M&C faces strong multinational and regional competitors. The primary
competitive factors in this business are product reliability, manufacturing
costs and engineering expertise.  The products of this business are sold
directly to original-equipment manufacturers and through distributors.
Revenues generated from sales to TI's top four M&C customers accounted for
approximately 16% of total M&C revenues in 1999.

Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) represents 5% of TI's 1999
revenues and is a leading supplier of educational and graphing calculators.
This business sells primarily through retailers and to schools through
instructional dealers.  TI's principal competitors in this business are Japan-


                                       -3-

and U.S.-based companies.  Technology expertise, price and infrastructure for
education and market understanding are primary competitive factors in this
business.  Revenues generated from sales to TI's top four E&PS customers
accounted for approximately 35% of total E&PS revenues in 1999.





Acquisitions and Divestitures
- -----------------------------

From time to time TI considers acquisitions and divestitures that may
strengthen its business portfolio.  TI may effect one or more of these
transactions at such time or times as it determines to be appropriate.  In
1999, to support TI's focus on digital signal processors and analog integrated
circuits, it acquired technology companies that brought unique expertise in
key markets for these core product areas.  In the first quarter, TI acquired
Butterfly VLSI, Ltd., a developer of chipsets for the short-distance wireless
market.  In the second quarter, TI acquired Libit Signal Processing Ltd., a
developer of cable modem chipsets.  In the third quarter, TI acquired ATL
Research A/S, a research and development company specializing in radio
frequency engineering, primarily for cellular phones; and Telogy Networks,
Inc., a developer of voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) software.  In the
fourth quarter, TI acquired two companies to support its analog catalog
portfolio:  Unitrode Corporation, a designer and supplier of power supply
control, interface and battery management components, all rapidly growing
technologies necessary for portable devices, power systems and interface
applications; and Power Trends, Inc., a supplier of point-of-use power
solutions. The acquisition of Unitrode was accounted for as a pooling of
interests in 1999.  All prior periods have been restated.  The acquisitions
of Telogy and Power Trends were also accounted for as pooling of
interests in 1999; the historical operations of these entities were not
significant in relation to TI's consolidated operations on either an
individual or an aggregate basis; consequently, prior period financial
statements have not been restated for these acquisitions.

In addition, in the third quarter, TI's Materials & Controls business acquired
Integrated Sensor Solutions, Inc., a developer of high performance sensors
that are used in electrical control systems in the automotive market, and the
Educational & Productivity Solutions business acquired Soft Warehouse, Inc., a
maker of mathematical software for educational and professional use.


Backlog
- -------
The dollar amount of backlog of orders believed by TI to be firm was $1827
million as of December 31, 1999 and $1265 million as of December 31, 1998.
Backlog orders are, under certain circumstances, subject to cancellation by
the purchaser without penalty.  Also, there is generally a short cycle between
order and shipment.  Accordingly, the company does not believe that its
backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual revenues
for any future period.


                                       -4-



Raw Materials
- -------------
TI purchases materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers.  The
materials, parts and supplies essential to TI's business are generally
available at present and TI believes at this time that such materials, parts
and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future.




Patents and Trademarks
- ----------------------
TI owns many patents in the United States and other countries in fields
relating to its business.  The company has developed a strong, broad-based
patent portfolio.  TI also has several agreements with other companies
involving license rights and anticipates that other licenses may be negotiated
in the future.  TI does not consider its business materially dependent upon
any one patent or patent license, although taken as a whole, the rights of TI
and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important
to TI's business.

TI owns trademarks that are used in the conduct of its business.  These
trademarks are valuable assets, the most important of which are "Texas
Instruments," TI's corporate monogram and "TMS320."


Research and Development
- ------------------------
TI's research and development expense was $1333 million in 1999, compared with
$1225 million in 1998 and $1556 million in 1997.  Included is a charge for the
value of acquisition-related purchased in-process research and development of
$79 million in 1999, $25 million in 1998, and $461 million in 1997.


Seasonality
- -----------
TI's revenues and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation.


Employees
- ---------
The information concerning the number of persons employed by TI at December 31,
1999 on page B-31 of TI's proxy statement for the 2000 annual meeting of
stockholders is incorporated herein by reference to such proxy statement.


Cautionary Statements Regarding Future Results of Operations
- ------------------------------------------------------------

You should read the following cautionary statements in conjunction with
discussions of factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of TI's filings


                                       -5-
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials
incorporated by reference in these filings.  These cautionary statements are
intended to highlight certain factors that may affect the financial condition
and results of operations of TI and are not meant to be an exhaustive
discussion of risks that apply to companies with broad international
operations, such as TI.  Like other businesses, TI is susceptible to
macroeconomic downturns in the United States or abroad that may affect the
general economic climate and performance of TI or its customers.  Similarly,
the price of TI's securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in
general market conditions, differences in TI's results of operations from
estimates and projections generated by the investment community and other
factors beyond TI's control.




     A Weakening in the Semiconductor Market May Adversely Affect TI's
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
     Performance.
     ------------

     TI's semiconductor business represents its largest business segment and
the principal source of its revenues.  The semiconductor market has
historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns.  A
significant weakening in the semiconductor market may adversely affect TI's
results of operations and have an adverse effect on the market price of its
securities.


     The Technology Industry is Characterized by Rapid Technological Change
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     that Requires TI to Develop New Technologies and Products.
     ----------------------------------------------------------

     TI's results of operations depend in part upon its ability to successfully
develop and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological
environment.  TI requires significant capital to develop new technologies and
products to meet changing customer demands that, in turn, may result in
shortened product lifecycles.   Moreover, expenditures for technology and
product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such
developments can be assured.  As a result, there can be no assurance that TI
will successfully develop and market these new products, that the products TI
does develop and market will be well received by customers or that TI will
realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products.


     TI's Faces Substantial Competition that Requires TI to Respond Rapidly to
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Product Development and Pricing Pressures.
     ------------------------------------------

     TI faces intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in
which it operates.  TI expects that the level of this competition will increase
in the future from large, established semiconductor and related product


                                       -6-

companies, as well as from emerging companies serving niche markets also served
by TI.  Certain of TI's competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and
management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably
against those products of TI that currently offer technological and/or price
advantages over competitive products.  Competition results in price and product
development pressures, which may result in reduced profit margins and lost
business opportunities in the event that TI is unable to match price declines
or technological, product, applications support, software or manufacturing
advances of its competitors.


     TI's Performance Depends upon its Ability to Enforce Its Intellectual
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Property Rights and to Develop or License New Intellectual Property.
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

     TI benefits from royalties generated from various license agreements that
will be in effect through the year 2005.  Future royalty revenues and access
to world-wide markets depend on the continued strength of TI's intellectual
property portfolio.  TI actively enforces and protects its intellectual
property rights, but there can be no assurance that TI's efforts will be
adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of the protected
technology.  Moreover, there can be no assurance that, as TI's business expands
into new areas, TI will be able to independently develop the technology,
software or know-how necessary to conduct its business.  TI may have to rely
increasingly on licensed technology from others.  To the extent that TI relies
on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that it will be able to
obtain all of the licenses it desires in the future on terms it considers
reasonable or at all.


     A Decline in Demand in Certain End-User Markets Could Have a Material
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Adverse Effect on the Demand for TI's Products and Results of Operations.
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     TI's customer base includes companies in a wide range of industries, but
TI generates a significant amount of revenues from sales to customers in the
telecommunications and computer-related industries.  Within these industries,
a large portion of TI revenues is generated by the sale of digital signal
processors and analog integrated circuits to customers in the cellular phone,
modem and hard disk drive segments of these industries.  A significant decline
in any one or several of these end-user markets could have a material adverse
effect on the demand for TI's products and its results of operations.


     There Can Be No Assurance of the Accuracy of the Assessment of Year 2000
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Issues.
     -------
     In anticipation of potential Year 2000 issues that result from the use of
two digit, rather than four digit, year dates in software, TI implemented a


                                       -7-

company-wide program to assess its Year 2000 readiness and, where appropriate,
to implement corrective actions.  TI does not anticipate any material
disruption in our operations as the result of any Year 2000 issues.  However,
there can be no assurance that TI has fully and accurately assessed its Year
2000 readiness or of the effectiveness of TI's corrective actions.  Nor can
there be any assurance that TI's customers and suppliers fully and accurately
assessed their Year 2000 readiness or of the effectiveness of their corrective
actions.


     TI's International Manufacturing Operations and Sales Subject It to Risks
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Associated with Legal, Political, Economic or Other Changes Outside of the
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     United States.
     --------------

     TI operates in 27 countries worldwide and in 1999 derived in excess of 67%
of its revenues from sales to locations outside the United States.  Operating
internationally exposes TI to changes in the laws or policies, as well as the
general economic conditions, of the various countries in which it operates,
which could result in an adverse effect on TI's business operations in such
countries and its results of operations.  Also, as discussed in more detail on
pages B-11, B-35 and B-36 of TI's proxy statement for the 2000 annual meeting
of stockholders, TI uses forward currency exchange contracts to minimize the
adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the
company's non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures.  Nevertheless, in
periods when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the non-U.S.
currencies in which TI transacts business, the remeasurement of non-U.S.
dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on TI's non-U.S. business.


     The Loss of or Significant Curtailment of Purchases by any of TI's Largest
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Customers Could Adversely Affect TI's Results of Operations.
     ------------------------------------------------------------

     While TI generates revenues from thousands of customers worldwide, the
loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of its top
customers, including curtailments due to a change in the sourcing policies or
practices of these customers, may adversely affect TI's results of operations.


     TI's Continued Success Depends Upon Its Ability to Retain and Recruit a
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Sufficient Number of Qualified Employees in a Competitive Environment.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     TI's continued success depends on the retention and recruitment of
skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff
personnel. Experienced personnel in the electronics industry are in high
demand and competition for their skills is intense.  There can be no


                                       -8-

assurance that TI will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key
personnel that it requires.

(4)  Owned on leased land.

TI's facilities in the United States contained approximately 17,100,000 square
feet as of December 31, 1999, of which approximately 3,300,000 square feet
were leased.  TI's facilities outside the United States contained approximately
5,200,000 square feet as of December 31, 1999, of which approximately 1,400,000
square feet were leased.

TI believes that its existing properties are in good condition and suitable
for the manufacture of its products.  At the end of 1999, the company utilized
substantially all of the space in its facilities.

Leases covering TI's leased facilities expire at varying dates generally
within the next 10 years.  TI anticipates no difficulty in either retaining
occupancy through lease renewals, month-to-month occupancy or purchases of
leased facilities, or replacing the leased facilities with equivalent
facilities.

ITEM 3.   Legal Proceedings.

Approximately $300 million of grants from the Italian government to TI's former
memory operations in Italy are being reviewed in the ordinary course by
government auditors.  TI understands that these auditors are questioning
whether some of the grants were applied to purposes outside the scope of the
grants.  TI's deferred gain on the sale of its memory business may be reduced
to the extent that any grants are determined to have been misapplied.  Also, TI
understands that an Italian prosecutor is conducting a criminal investigation
concerning a portion of the grants relating to specified research and
development activities.  The company believes that the grants were obtained and
used in compliance with applicable law and contractual obligations.

TI is involved in various investigations and proceedings conducted by the
federal Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental
agencies regarding disposal of waste materials.  Although the factual
situations and the progress of each of these matters differ, the company
believes that the amount of its liability will not have a material adverse
effect upon its financial position or results of operations and, in most cases,
TI's liability will be limited to sharing clean-up or other remedial costs with
other potentially responsible parties.

"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995:

This report includes "forward-looking statements" intended to qualify for the
safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995.  These forward-looking statements generally can be
identified by phrases such as TI or its management "believes," "expects,"
"anticipates," "foresees," "forecasts," "estimates" or other words or phrases
of similar import.  Similarly, statements herein that describe TI's business
strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-
looking statements.  All such forward-looking statements are subject to certain
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those in forward-looking statements.

We urge you to carefully consider the following important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations of TI or its
management:

- -   Market demand for semiconductors, particularly for digital signal
    processors and analog integrated circuits in key markets, such as
    telecommunications and computers.

- -   TI's ability to develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a
    rapidly changing technological environment.

- -   TI's ability to compete in products and prices in an intensely competitive
    industry.

- -   TI's ability to maintain and enforce a strong intellectual property
    portfolio and obtain needed licenses from third parties.

- -   Accurate assessment of Year 2000 by TI, its customers and its suppliers.

- -   Global economic, social and political conditions in the countries in which
    TI and its customers and suppliers operate, including fluctuations in
    foreign currency exchange rates.

- -   Losses or curtailments of purchases from key customers or the timing of
    customer inventory corrections.


                                       -19-
- -   TI's ability to recruit and retain skilled personnel.

- -   Availability of raw materials and critical manufacturing equipment.

"Cautionary Statements Regarding Future Results of Operations" in Item 1 of

this report.  The forward-looking statements included in this report are made
only as of the date of this report and TI undertakes no obligation to publicly
