ITEM 1.

Business.

Company Overview

Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and has manufacturing, design or sales operations in more than 25 countries. We had two business
segments in 2007: 1) Semiconductor, which accounted for 96 percent of our revenue, and 2) Education Technology, which accounted for 4 percent of our revenue.

Financial information with respect to our business segments and our operations outside the United States is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned “Segment and Geographic Area Data” on pages 39 through 41 of
TI’s 2007 annual report to stockholders. It is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report.

The company
began operations in 1930 and is incorporated in Delaware.

Semiconductor Segment

Semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside of modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors come in two basic forms: individual transistors and integrated circuits
(generally known as “chips”) that combine different transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit. Our Semiconductor segment designs, manufactures and sells integrated circuits.

The global semiconductor market is characterized by constant, though generally incremental, advances in product designs and manufacturing methods. Typically, new chips
are produced in limited quantities at first and then ramp to high-volume production over time. Chip prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing methods and product life cycles mature.

The “semiconductor cycle” is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand. The semiconductor market historically has been
characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strong demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus products caused by declining demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. This cycle is affected by the
significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities.

We were the world’s fourth largest semiconductor
company in 2007 as measured by revenue, according to preliminary estimates from an external source. Historically, our Semiconductor segment averages a significantly higher growth rate than our Education Technology segment.

The majority of our Semiconductor revenue comes from our core products: analog semiconductors and digital signal processors, or DSPs. These products enhance, and often
make possible, a variety of applications that serve the communications, computer, consumer electronics, automotive and industrial markets. We believe that virtually all of today’s electronic equipment requires some form of analog or digital
signal processing.

We also design and manufacture other types of semiconductors, such as
microcontrollers used in safety-critical automotive applications, DLP

®

products that enable exceptionally clear video, and microprocessors that serve as the brains of high-end computer
servers.

Knowledge about the systems our products go into is becoming increasingly important, because it enables us to differentiate our product offerings
for our customers. Where a customer may previously have required multiple chips for a system to operate, we are now integrating the functionality of those multiple chips onto a few or even a single chip because we have both the system-level
knowledge and the manufacturing technology to do so. An example is our single-chip cell phone solution, which combines the functionality of many separate chips onto one. The digitization of electronics also requires more high-performance analog
functionality. With expertise in both digital signal processing and analog at the system level, we believe we are one of a very few semiconductor companies capable of integrating both technologies onto a single chip.

In addition, we enable our customers, particularly original design manufacturers (ODMs), to take advantage of our system-level knowledge and thereby speed their time to
market by making available to them standard chipsets and reference designs. (An ODM designs and manufactures products for other companies; those other companies then sell the products under their


own brands. A chipset is a group of integrated circuits based principally on our technology that are designed to work together for a specific application and
are therefore packaged and sold as a unit. Reference designs are technical blueprints that contain all the essential elements of a system.) Customers using our reference designs, such as cell phone ODMs, may enhance or modify the design as they
require. Our ability to deliver integrated solutions and system-level knowledge allows our customers to create more advanced systems and products.

In each
of our product categories, we face significant competition. We believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market depends upon several factors, including the breadth of a company’s product line, technological innovation, quality,
reliability, price, customer service, technical support and scale.

Following is detailed information on each product
category:

Analog

Analog semiconductors connect digital signal processors and other types of logic devices to the outside world, taking real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure and visual images, conditioning them, amplifying them and
converting them into digital form and back into real-world signals. They also help manage power distribution and consumption, aspects critical to today’s portable electronic devices.

The analog semiconductor market is diverse and complex, and it is one of the largest sectors of the semiconductor industry. According to external sources, we are the
world’s largest supplier of analog semiconductors. Analog chips generated about 40 percent of our Semiconductor revenue in 2007, and we expect analog to be the primary growth driver for the company in the years ahead.

Our analog product portfolio includes custom mixed-signal products that are designed to a particular customer’s or application’s specifications. These products
account for about 50 percent of our analog revenue. The remainder of our analog revenue comes from standard products that are sold across a range of customers and applications. About 45 percent of our analog revenue is from high-performance standard
products and about 5 percent is from commodity standard products.

Many of our custom and standard products are proprietary and difficult for competitors
to imitate. Many standard analog chips tend to have long life spans.

Our mixed-signal products combine multiple types of analog functionality or analog
and digital functions on a single chip. Purchasers of our custom mixed-signal products tend to be very large companies that require high-volume designs for specific applications such as communications, displays, printers and automotive. Entry into
this market requires significant up-front investment as well as expertise in both analog and digital functionality. The primary competitive factors in this market include design proficiency, and manufacturing expertise and scale.

In the standard analog chip sub-category known as high-performance analog, we have a portfolio of about 20,000 products, including data converters, amplifiers, power
management devices and interface chips. Our high-performance analog products are used by more than 50,000 customers who incorporate our products into a variety of devices sold both in established markets such as for industrial, communications,
computer and consumer devices, and in emerging product markets such as for medical devices. These products are sold primarily through distributors. Prices in this market tend to be stable, with relatively high gross profit margins. The primary
competitive factors are a diverse product portfolio to meet wide-ranging customer needs, and manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance. Products with higher levels of performance tend to command a premium
price.

Our other standard analog chips are commodity in nature. We design and manufacture thousands of low-cost, high-volume standard products that are
sold primarily through distributors. End applications are very diverse and include portable electronic devices and communications. The primary competitive factors in this market are price and availability. Pricing is strongly influenced by supply
and demand.

Overall in the analog market, we compete globally with numerous large and small companies, both broad-based suppliers and niche suppliers. Our
primary competitors include Analog Devices, Inc.; Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.; Infineon Technologies AG; Linear Technology Corporation; Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.; National Semiconductor Corporation; NXP B.V.; and STMicroelectronics NV.


Digital Signal Processors, or DSPs

DSPs use complex algorithms and compression techniques to alter and improve a data stream. DSPs perform these functions instantaneously and power-efficiently. These
products are ideal for applications that require precise, real-time processing of real-world analog signals that have been converted into digital form. Their power efficiency is important for battery-powered devices.

Combining DSP and analog functionality enables a broad range of significant applications. In a cell phone, the process works as follows: 1) the sender’s voice is
picked up by an analog sensor in the cell phone’s microphone; 2) an analog-to-digital converter chip changes the analog sound waves of the sender’s voice into a digital code; 3) the DSP compresses these digital signals and removes
background noise; and 4) in the listener’s cell phone, the digital code is converted back into the analog sound of the sender’s voice. All this happens in real time.

We offer programmable DSPs, which, among other benefits, enable manufacturers to differentiate their product designs via software rather than having to design new hardware. According to external sources, we are the
world’s largest DSP supplier. DSPs represent about 40 percent of our Semiconductor revenue.

Our DSP portfolio includes custom, application-specific
and standard products. Custom products are designed for specific customers with very high volumes in established markets. Application-specific products are implementations crafted for specific applications such as wireless infrastructure, VoIP
(Voice over Internet Protocol) gateways, video image enhancement, medical, digital still cameras and residential gateways, to name a few. Our standard DSP products are sold into a broad range of applications and seed the next generation of
signal-processing innovation.

About 80 percent of our DSP revenue comes from the cell phone market. To satisfy diverse customer needs, our portfolio of
products for cell phone applications consists of both custom and standard products. These products are typically highly integrated semiconductor devices that allow our customers to differentiate their cell phone products from their competitors’
products through performance, long battery life, features or cost. Also included in our DSP-based wireless portfolio are the widely used OMAP™ processors, which are high-performance processors that enable multimedia applications in cell phones
and other electronic devices.

In the DSP market, we compete globally with numerous large and small companies, both broad-based and niche suppliers of DSPs
as well as suppliers of other technologies that deliver functionality that competes with DSPs. Primary competitive factors are the ability to design and cost-effectively manufacture products, system-level knowledge about targeted end markets,
software expertise and applications support. Our primary competitors in the DSP market are Analog Devices, Inc.; Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.; Infineon Technologies AG; and NXP B.V. Others who offer competing technologies include Broadcom Corp.;
Marvell Technology Group, Ltd.; MediaTek Inc.; and QUALCOMM Incorporated.

Other Semiconductor Products

Our other Semiconductor products, which combined account for about 20 percent of our Semiconductor revenue, include the following:

DLP

®

Products

Our DLP technology is a digital display technology used in projectors and high-definition televisions (HDTVs). Projectors based on this technology are used in businesses,
homes, professional venues and increasingly in movie theaters. The technology consists of micro-electromechanical devices that use optical semiconductors to digitally manipulate light. At the center of every DLP product is an array of up to
2.2 million microscopic mirrors. Each mirror tilts back and forth thousands of times each second to create a high resolution, highly reliable, full color image. This technology is used by more than 50 of the world’s top projector and
television manufacturers.

Our DLP technology competes against other display technologies such as liquid crystal display- (LCD) based projectors, and
flat-screen LCD- and plasma-based HDTVs . The primary competitive elements in this market include picture quality, product form factors, reliability and price.


Reduced Instruction-Set Computing (RISC) Microprocessors

A microprocessor is the central processing unit of a computer system. RISC microprocessors are designed to provide very fast computing, typically for a specialized
application such as servers. Our RISC products are primarily 64-bit microprocessors designed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. for use in Sun servers.

Microcontrollers

A microcontroller is a microprocessor designed to control a very specific task for electronic equipment. Key applications
for our microcontrollers include personal medical, automotive, utility meters, portable consumer products, industrial applications, motor controls and digital power management. Primary competitive factors in this market include integration of
control peripherals for reduced board space and number of components, ultra-low power consumption, an easy-to-use integrated development environment for fast system development and a broad range of microcontroller solutions for upgradeability and
flexibility in system design.

Standard Logic

Standard
logic devices are chips generally used to manage the interchange and manipulation of signals within a system. A substantial number of our standard logic products are considered commodities, for which price and delivery are the key competitive
factors. We sell thousands of different standard logic products, primarily to distributors. End applications include consumer products and communications.

Royalties

An additional source of revenue for TI is royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics
companies.

Applications for Our Semiconductor Products

The table below lists the major end markets that use our Semiconductor products and the approximate percentage of our Semiconductor revenue that the market represents.
The chart also lists the most frequent applications and our products used within these key markets.

Manufacturing

Semiconductor manufacturing begins with the wafer fabrication manufacturing process: a sequence of photo-lithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a
number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each device on the wafer is tested and the wafer is cut into pieces called chips. Each chip is assembled into a package that then may be retested. The entire process typically requires between
twelve and eighteen weeks and takes place in highly specialized facilities.


Digital products require the most advanced and most capital-intensive wafer fabrication manufacturing processes and
equipment. Digital products tend to move to more advanced processes and equipment every few years. As a result, maintaining an industry-leadership position in digital manufacturing requires significant capital spending, along with investment in
research and development (R&D), in order to develop new manufacturing processes and capabilities.

Analog products typically do not require the same
level of advanced wafer fabrication manufacturing processes and equipment as digital products. Although analog products benefit from unique, proprietary manufacturing processes, these processes can be applied using older, less-expensive equipment.
Additionally, analog manufacturing processes and equipment remain usable for production for much longer than digital manufacturing processes and equipment. Consequently, for equivalent capacity, the level of capital and R&D spending needed to
support analog manufacturing is considerably less than is needed for digital manufacturing.

We have semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North
America, Asia and Europe. These facilities include high-volume wafer fabrication plants and assembly/test sites. To support our future manufacturing needs, our environmentally efficient Richardson, Texas wafer fabrication facility (RFAB) is complete
and ready for equipment installation, allowing for rapid increases of digital or analog capacity whenever the market demands. In addition, an environmentally efficient assembly/test facility in the Philippines is now under construction, with initial
production planned in the second half of 2008.

Our semiconductor manufacturing facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely
fixed-cost assets once operating. Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed. In general, these costs do not decline when customer demand or our capacity utilization rates drop,
potentially hurting our profit margins. Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, potentially benefiting our profit margins.

To supplement our internal wafer fabrication capacity, maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and minimize our overall capital expenditures, we have implemented
a manufacturing strategy that utilizes the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries. For advanced digital chips, our strategy involves installing internal wafer fabrication capacity to a level we believe will remain fully utilized
over the equipment’s useful lifetime and then outsourcing remaining capacity needs to foundries. Currently, external foundries provide about 25 percent of our total wafers and about 50 percent of the wafers for our advanced digital products. We
expect the proportion of our advanced digital wafers provided by foundries will increase over time. Conversely, we expect to install sufficient internal wafer fabrication capacity to meet substantially all our analog production needs.


In addition to using foundries to supplement our wafer fabrication needs, we use subcontractors to supplement our
assembly and test needs. We generally use subcontractors for assembly/test of products it would be less cost-efficient to complete in-house (e.g., relatively low-volume products that are unlikely to keep internal equipment fully utilized), or in the
event demand temporarily exceeds our internal capacity.

This internal/external manufacturing strategy is designed to reduce the level of our required
capital expenditures, and thereby reduce our subsequent levels of depreciation. Expected end results include less fluctuation in our profit margins due to changing product demand, and lower cash requirements for expanding and updating our
manufacturing capabilities.

Another element of our manufacturing strategy for digital chips involves working collaboratively with our foundry suppliers to
develop future generations of digital wafer fabrication manufacturing process technology. Historically, we have developed these manufacturing processes in-house. In 2007, we transitioned to a collaborative development model with our foundry
suppliers. This strategic shift will allow us to better serve customers with cost-effective digital manufacturing process technology from our foundry suppliers, while also increasing the efficiency of our own R&D and capital. We will continue to
develop our own analog manufacturing process technologies.

Inventory

Our inventory practices vary depending on the type of product. For standard products, where the risk of obsolescence is low, we generally carry higher levels of
inventory. These products usually have many customers and long life cycles, and are often ordered in small quantities. Standard product inventory is sometimes held in unfinished wafer form, giving us greater flexibility to meet final package and
test configurations. Examples of these products are high-performance analog, standard DSPs, and standard microcontrollers. For custom products, where the risk of obsolescence is higher, we carry lower levels of inventory when possible. These
products usually have a single customer, are sold in high volumes and have comparatively shorter life cycles. Life cycles of these products are often determined by end-equipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months. Examples of
these products are digital baseband processors for cell phones and custom application-specific analog and digital products. In addition, our inventory levels have increased over time due to the impact of consignment programs at our largest
customers, our distributors’ desire to carry less inventory, and our increased mix of standard products such as high-performance analog.

Design Centers

Our design centers provide design, engineering and product application support as well as after-sales
customer service. The design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers.

Customers

Our Semiconductor
products are sold to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), ODMs, contract manufacturers and distributors. (An OEM designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures in-house or has manufactured by others.) Our largest single
customer in 2007 was an OEM, the Nokia group of companies. Direct sales to Nokia were more than 15 percent of our revenue in 2007 and more than 10 percent of our revenue in 2006.

Sales and Distribution

We market
and sell our products through a direct sales force, distributors and authorized third-party sales representatives. We have sales or marketing offices in over 25 countries worldwide and have expanded our sales networks in the emerging markets of
China, India and Eastern Europe. Distributors located around the world account for about 30 percent of our overall Semiconductor revenue, and a majority of our revenue from many standard products (e.g., high-performance analog, standard DSP and
standard logic products). Our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers. They also sell products from our competitors.

Education Technology Segment

Education Technology is a leading supplier of graphing handheld calculators. This
business segment also provides its customers with business and scientific calculators and a wide range of advanced classroom tools and professional development resources to help students and teachers interactively explore math and science. Education
Technology relies on third-party manufacturers to build its products. This segment contributed 4 percent of our 2007 revenue.


Competition

Our principal competitors in this business are United States- and Japan-based companies, including Casio Computer Co., Ltd. and Hewlett-Packard Company. The principal competitive factors are an understanding of the
education market, technology expertise and price.

Sales and Distribution

Education Technology sells its products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers.

Acquisitions, Divestitures and Investments

From time to time
we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio. We also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies. Investments are focused primarily on next-generation technologies and markets
strategic to us.

In July 2007, we completed the sale of our broadband digital subscriber line (DSL) customer-premises equipment semiconductor product line
to Infineon Technologies AG for $61 million.

Backlog

We define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customer-requested delivery date within a specified length of time. As customer requirements and industry conditions change, orders may be, under certain
circumstances, subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing, quantity or delivery date. Customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities, as well as
industry supply and capacity considerations. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period. Although we ship a substantial number of orders in the quarter in which they are
received, our backlog of orders was $1.50 billion at December 31, 2007, and $1.64 billion at December 31, 2006.

Raw Materials

We purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers. In some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers. The materials, parts
and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future.

Intellectual Property

We own many patents, and have many patent applications pending, in the United States
and other countries in fields relating to our business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio. We also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate
that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future. In general, our license agreements have multi-year terms and may be renewed after renegotiation.

Our Semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to Semiconductor revenue. We do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license, although taken as a whole, our rights and the products made
and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business.

We often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards. Our
competitors may also participate in the same initiatives. Participation in these initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies.

We own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business. These trademarks are valuable assets, the most
important of which are “Texas Instruments” and our corporate monogram. Other valuable trademarks include DLP

®

and OMAP

TM

.

Research and Development

Our primary area of R&D investment is semiconductor products and semiconductor manufacturing technology. We conduct most of our R&D internally. However, we also
closely engage with a wide range of external industry consortia and universities and collaborate with our foundry suppliers.


From time to time we may terminate R&D projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed
product. We do not expect that all of our R&D projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute to revenue until at least a few years following completion.

Our R&D expense was $2.15 billion in 2007, compared with $2.20 billion in 2006 and $1.99 billion in 2005.

Seasonality

Our revenue and operating results are subject to
some seasonal variation. Education Technology experiences its strongest results in the second and third quarters in preparation for the back-to-school season. The Semiconductor segment generally is seasonally weaker in the first quarter than it is
in other quarters, particularly for products sold into cell phone and consumer electronics applications that have stronger sales later in the year as manufacturers prepare for the holiday selling season.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors.

You should read the following Risk Factors in
conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings. These Risk Factors are intended to highlight certain
factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like TI with broad international operations. Like other companies, we are susceptible to
macroeconomic downturns in the United States or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in
general market conditions, differences in our results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community, and other factors beyond our control.

Cyclicality in the Semiconductor Market May Affect Our Performance.

Our semiconductor business is our largest business segment and the principal source of our revenue. The semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and
decreases in product demand. These changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations, and on the market price of our securities. In particular, our strategic focus in this business is on the development and marketing of analog
integrated circuits and digital signal processors. The results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for analog integrated circuits or digital signal processors decreases or if these markets or key end-equipment markets
such as communications, consumer electronics and computing grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects.

Our Margins May
Vary over Time.

Our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our shipment volume,
reductions in, or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix. In addition, the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products. Because we own much of our manufacturing
capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed. In general, these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or our utilization of our manufacturing capacity, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result.

The Technology Industry Is Characterized by Rapid Technological Change That Requires Us to Develop New Technologies and Products.

Our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing
technological environment. We require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that, in turn, may result in shortened product life cycles. Moreover, expenditures for technology and product
development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products. There also is no assurance that the products
we do develop and market will be well received by customers, nor that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products.

We Face Substantial Competition That Requires Us to Respond Rapidly to Product Development and Pricing Pressures.

We face intense
technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. We expect the level of this competition will increase in the future from large, established semiconductor and related product companies, as well as from smaller companies
serving niche markets. Certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products. The price and product development pressures that
result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or technological, product, applications support, software or manufacturing
advancements of our competitors.


Our Performance Depends in Part upon Our Ability to Enforce Our Intellectual Property Rights and to
Develop and License New Intellectual Property.

Access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property
portfolio. There can be no assurance that, as our business expands into new areas, we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the
intellectual property rights of others. We may have to rely increasingly on licensed technology from others. To the extent that we rely on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain them at all or on terms we
consider reasonable. The lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunction from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have contractually agreed to indemnify our
customers against damages resulting from infringement claims.

We actively enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, but there can be no
assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of the protected technology.

We benefit from royalty revenue
generated from various patent license agreements. The amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees, and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses. There is no guarantee that such negotiations
will be successful. Future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts, and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees. Additionally, the consolidation of our
licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue. Royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable, in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and
renewal of existing agreements.

A Decline in Demand in Certain End-User Markets Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Demand for
Our Products and Results of Operations.

Our customer base includes companies in a wide range of industries, but we generate a significant amount of
revenue from sales to customers in the communications- and computer-related industries. Within these industries, a large portion of our revenue is generated by the sale of analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors to customers in the
cell phone, personal computer and communications infrastructure markets. Decline in one or several of these end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition.

Our Global Manufacturing, Design and Sales Activities Subject Us to Risks Associated with Legal, Political, Economic or Other Changes.

We have facilities in more than 25 countries worldwide, and in 2007 more than 80 percent of our revenue came from sales to locations outside the United
States. Operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies, as well as the general political and economic conditions, security risks, health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks,
of the various countries in which we operate. Any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results. Also, as discussed in more detail on pages 58 and 59 of our 2007 annual report to stockholders, we use
forward currency exchange contracts to minimize the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Nevertheless, in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in
relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business, the remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our Results of Operations Could be Affected by Natural Events in the Locations in which We, Our Customers or Suppliers Operate.

We have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural events such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations. In addition,
our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. A natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may adversely affect our results and financial
condition.


The Loss of or Significant Curtailment of Purchases by Any of Our Largest Customers Could Adversely
Affect Our Results of Operations.

While we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide, the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases
by one or more of our top customers, including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, may adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition.

Incorrect Forecasts of Customer Demand Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations.

Our ability to match inventory and production mix with the product mix needed to fill current orders and orders to be delivered in the given quarter
may affect our ability to meet that quarter’s revenue forecast. In addition, when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands. These forecasts are
based on multiple assumptions. If we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our Performance Depends on the Availability and Cost of Raw Materials, Utilities, Critical Manufacturing Equipment, Manufacturing Processes and
Third-Party Manufacturing Services.

Our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials and
utilities be available. Limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment
could adversely affect our results of operations. We subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits. We also depend on third parties to provide advanced digital process technology development. We
depend on a limited number of third parties to perform these functions. We do not have long-term contracts with all of these third parties. Reliance on these third parties involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high
demand, the third parties’ inability to develop and deliver advanced digital process technology in a timely, cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us.

Our Results of Operations Could be Affected by Changes in Taxation.

We have facilities in more than 25 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. Tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our results of
operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries, or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we
operate.

In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various locations that govern the determination of which is the appropriate jurisdiction
to decide when and how much profit has been earned and is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. Changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of
operations. We have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. Each quarter we forecast
our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year. If that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability will change.

Our Results of Operations Could be Affected by Changes in the Financial Markets.

We maintain bank accounts,
multi-year revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of liquid short-term investments to support the financing needs of the company. Our ability to fund our daily operations, invest in our business, and make strategic acquisitions requires
continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, as well as access to our bank credit lines, which support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. If we are unable to access these accounts
and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Similarly, such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets
or redeem our investments.


Our Results of Operations Could be Affected by Warranty Claims, Product Recalls or Product Liability.

We could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as
we defend such claims or pay damage awards. The risk of a significant claim is generally greater for products used in health and safety applications. In the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected
customer or end consumer. We do maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. In addition, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a
product containing a TI part. In such instances, we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. Costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty, epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition.

Our Continued Success Depends in Part on Our Ability to Retain and Recruit a Sufficient
Number of Qualified Employees in a Competitive Environment.

Our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled
personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel. Experienced personnel in the electronics industry are in high demand and competition for their skills is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require.

ITEM 1B.

Unresolved Staff Comments.

ITEM 2.

Properties.

Our principal executive offices are located at 12500
TI Boulevard, Dallas, Texas. The following table indicates the general location of our principal manufacturing and design operations and the business segments that make major use of them. Except as otherwise indicated, we own these facilities.

(1)

Leased.

(2)

Portions of the facilities are leased and owned.

Our facilities in the United States contained approximately 14.1 million square feet at December 31, 2007, of which approximately 1.8 million square feet
were leased. Our facilities outside the United States contained approximately 5.8 million square feet at December 31, 2007, of which approximately 1.5 million square feet were leased.

At the end of 2007, we occupied substantially all of the space in our facilities.

Leases covering our currently occupied leased facilities expire at varying dates generally within the next 8 years. We believe our current properties are suitable and adequate for both their intended purpose and our current and foreseeable
future needs.


ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings.

We are involved in various proceedings
conducted by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and certain other governmental environmental agencies regarding clean-up of contaminated sites. These proceedings are being coordinated with the agencies and, in certain cases, with other
potentially responsible parties. Although the factual situations and the progress of each of these matters differ, we believe that the amount of our liability will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

The Internal Revenue Code requires that companies disclose in their Form 10-K whether they have been required to pay penalties to
the Internal Revenue Service for certain transactions that have been identified by the IRS as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose. We have not been required to pay any such penalties.

(2)

All purchases during the quarter were made through open-market purchases except for 555,000 shares that were acquired in

portion of our deferred compensation obligations denominated in TI stock.

(3)

The total number of shares purchased includes the purchase of 3,000,000 shares for which trades were settled in the
first three business days of January 2008 for $101 million. The table does not include the purchase of 1,500,000 shares pursuant to orders placed in the third quarter, for which trades were settled in the first three business days of the fourth

Management Compensation Plans and Arrangements.

“Safe Harbor” Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:

This report includes forward-looking statements
intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by phrases such as TI or its management “believes,”
“expects,” “anticipates,” “foresees,” “forecasts,” “estimates” or other words or phrases of similar import. Similarly, statements herein that describe TI’s business strategy, outlook,
objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements. All such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking
statements.

We urge you to carefully consider the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations
of TI or its management:

•

Market demand for semiconductors, particularly for analog chips and digital signal processors in key markets such as communications, entertainment electronics and
computing;

•

TI’s ability to maintain or improve profit margins, including its ability to utilize its manufacturing facilities at sufficient levels to cover its fixed
operating costs, in an intensely competitive and cyclical industry;

•

TI’s ability to develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment;

•

TI’s ability to compete in products and prices in an intensely competitive industry;

•

TI’s ability to maintain and enforce a strong intellectual property portfolio and obtain needed licenses from third parties;

•

Expiration of license agreements between TI and its patent licensees, and market conditions reducing royalty payments to TI;


•

Economic, social and political conditions in the countries in which TI, its customers or its suppliers operate, including security risks, health conditions,
possible disruptions in transportation networks and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

Natural events such as severe weather and earthquakes in the locations in which TI, its customers or its suppliers operate;

•

Availability and cost of raw materials, utilities, manufacturing equipment, third-party manufacturing services and manufacturing technology;

•

Changes in the tax rate applicable to TI as the result of changes in tax law, the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed, the outcome
of tax audits and the ability to realize deferred tax assets;

•

Losses or curtailments of purchases from key customers and the timing and amount of distributor and other customer inventory adjustments;

•

Customer demand that differs from our forecasts;

•

The financial impact of inadequate or excess TI inventory that results from demand that differs from projections;

•

TI’s ability to access its bank accounts and lines of credit or otherwise access the capital markets;

•

Product liability or warranty claims, claims based on epidemic or delivery failure or recalls by TI customers for a product containing a TI part;

•

TI’s ability to recruit and retain skilled personnel; and

•

Timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies, installation of manufacturing equipment and the ability to obtain needed third-party foundry and
assembly/test subcontract services.

For a more detailed discussion of these factors see the Risk Factors discussion in Item 1A of
this report. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date of this report and TI undertakes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
