ITEM 1.

Business.

Company Overview

Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and has manufacturing, design or sales operations in more than 25 countries. We had two separate
business segments in 2006: 1) Semiconductor, which accounted for 96 percent of our revenue and 2) Education Technology, which accounted for 4 percent of our revenue.

The year saw changes in our segments. In January we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our former Sensors & Controls business, and its results were reported as a discontinued operation. The sale
closed on April 27, 2006. At the end of the year, we decided to rename a segment to reflect its strategic focus; Educational & Productivity Solutions became Education Technology.

Financial information with respect to TI’s business segments and operations outside the United States is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned
“Segment and Geographic Area Data” on pages

32 and

33 of TI’s 2006 annual report to stockholders. It is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report.

The company began operations in 1930 and is incorporated in Delaware.

Semiconductor Segment

Semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside of modern
electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors come in two basic forms: individual transistors and integrated circuits (generally known as “chips”) that combine different transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete
electronic circuit. Our Semiconductor segment designs, manufactures and sells integrated circuits.

The global semiconductor market is characterized by
constant, though generally incremental, advances in product designs and manufacturing methods. Typically, new chips are produced in limited quantities at first and then ramp to high-volume production over time. Chip prices and manufacturing costs
tend to decline over time as manufacturing methods and product life cycles mature.

The “semiconductor cycle” is an important concept that refers
to the ebb and flow of supply and demand. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strong demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus products caused by
declining demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. This cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities.

We were the world’s third largest semiconductor company in 2006 as measured by revenue, according to preliminary estimates from iSuppli Corporation, an industry analyst. Historically, our Semiconductor segment
averages a significantly higher growth rate than our Education Technology segment.

The majority of our Semiconductor revenue comes from our core products,
which are analog semiconductors and digital signal processors, or DSPs. These products enhance, and often make possible, a variety of applications that serve the communications, computer, consumer electronics, automotive and industrial markets. We
believe that virtually all of today’s digital electronic equipment requires some form of analog or digital signal processing.

We also design and
manufacture other types of semiconductors, such as DLP

®

products that enable exceptionally clear video, and microprocessors that serve as the brains of high-end computer servers.

Knowledge about the systems our products go into is becoming increasingly important, because it enables us to differentiate our product offerings for our customers. Where a customer may previously have required multiple chips for a system
to operate, we are now integrating the functionality of those multiple chips onto a few or even a single chip because we have both the system-level knowledge and the manufacturing technology to do so. An example is our single-chip cell phone
solution, which combines the functionality of many separate chips onto one. The digitization of electronics also requires more high-performance analog functionality. With expertise in both digital signal processing and analog at the system level, we
believe we are one of a very few semiconductor companies capable of integrating both technologies onto a single chip.

In addition, we enable our
customers, particularly original design manufacturers (ODMs), to take advantage of our system-level knowledge and thereby speed their time to market by making available to them standard chipsets and reference designs. (An ODM designs and
manufactures products for other companies; those other companies then sell the products under their


own brands. A chipset is a group of integrated circuits based principally on our technology that are designed to work together for a specific application and
are therefore packaged and sold as a unit. Reference designs are technical blueprints that contain all the essential elements of a system.) Customers using our reference designs, such as cell-phone ODMs, may enhance or modify the design as required.
Our ability to deliver integrated solutions and system-level knowledge allows our customers to create more advanced systems and products.

In each of our
product categories, we face significant competition. We believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market depends upon several factors, including the breadth of a company’s product line as well as technological innovation,
quality, reliability, price, customer service, technical support and scale.

Following is detailed information on each
product category:

Analog

Analog semiconductors process “real world” inputs, such as sound, temperature, pressure and visual images, conditioning them, amplifying them and converting them into digital signals. They also assist in the management of power
distribution and consumption, aspects critical to today’s portable electronic devices.

The analog semiconductor market is diverse and complex, and it
is one of the largest sectors of the semiconductor industry. We are the world’s largest supplier of analog semiconductors. Analog chips generated about 40 percent of our Semiconductor revenue in 2006.

Our analog product portfolio includes custom mixed-signal products that are designed to a particular customer’s or application’s specifications. These products
account for about 55 percent of our analog revenue. The remainder of our analog revenue comes from standard products that are sold across a range of customers and applications. About 40 percent of our analog revenue is from high-performance standard
products and about 5 percent is from commodity standard products.

Many of our custom and standard products are proprietary and difficult for competitors
to imitate. Many standard analog chips tend to have long life spans.

Our mixed-signal products combine multiple types of analog functionality or analog
and digital functions on a single chip. Purchasers of our custom mixed-signal products tend to be very large companies that require high-volume designs for specific applications such as communications, displays, printers and automotive. Entry into
this market requires significant up-front investment as well as expertise in both analog and digital functionality. A primary competitive factor in this market is manufacturing expertise and scale.

In the standard analog chip sub-category known as high-performance analog, we have a portfolio of about 15,000 products, including data converters, amplifiers, power
management devices and interface chips. Our high-performance analog products are used by more than 50,000 customers. These products are sold primarily through distributors. Prices in this market tend to be stable, with relatively high gross profit
margins. The primary competitive factors are a diverse product portfolio to meet wide-ranging customer needs, and manufacturing process technologies that allow us to provide differentiated levels of performance. Products with higher levels of
performance tend to command a premium price.

Other standard analog chips are commodity in nature. We design and manufacture thousands of low-cost,
high-volume standard products that are sold primarily through distributors. End applications are very diverse and include portable electronic devices and communications. The primary competitive factors in this market are price and availability.
Pricing is strongly influenced by supply and demand.

Overall in the analog market, we compete globally with numerous large and small companies, both
broad-based suppliers and niche suppliers. Our primary competitors include Analog Devices, Inc.; Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.; Infineon Technologies AG; Linear Technology Corporation; Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.; National Semiconductor
Corporation; NXP B.V.; and STMicroelectronics NV.

Digital Signal Processors, or DSPs

DSP is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the semiconductor industry. We are the world’s largest DSP supplier, and DSP represents about 40 percent of our
Semiconductor revenue.

DSPs use complex algorithms and compression techniques to alter and improve a data stream. DSPs perform these functions
instantaneously and power-efficiently. These products are ideal for applications that require precise, real-time processing of real-world analog signals that have been converted into digital form. Their power efficiency is important for
battery-powered devices.


The combination of DSP with analog functionality enables a broad range of significant applications. In a cell phone, the
process works as follows: 1) the sender’s voice is picked up by an analog sensor in the cell phone’s microphone; 2) an analog-to-digital converter chip changes the analog sound waves of the sender’s voice into a digital code; 3) the
DSP compresses these digital signals and removes background noise; and 4) in the listener’s cell phone, the digital code is converted back into the analog sound of the sender’s voice. All this happens in real time.

We offer programmable DSPs, which, among other benefits, enable manufacturers to differentiate their product designs via software rather than having to design new
hardware.

Our DSP portfolio includes custom, application-specific and standard products. Custom products are designed for specific customers with very
high volumes in established markets. Application-specific products are implementations crafted for specific applications like wireless infrastructure, VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) gateways, digital still cameras and residential gateways, to
name a few. Our standard DSP products are sold into a broad range of applications and seed the next generation of signal-processing innovation.

About 80
percent of our DSP revenue comes from the cell-phone market, most of which is derived from custom chips that we develop with large cell-phone manufacturer customers. These products are typically highly integrated semiconductor devices that allow our
customers to differentiate their cell-phone products from their competitors’ products through performance, features or cost, and are sold only to a single, high-volume customer. Additional DSP revenue from this market comes from our sales of
chipsets. Also included in our DSP-based wireless portfolio are the widely used OMAP

™

processors, which are high-performance processors that enable multimedia applications in cell phones and other electronic devices.

In the DSP market, we compete globally with numerous large and small companies, both broad-based and niche suppliers of DSPs as well as suppliers of other technologies that deliver functionality that competes with
DSPs. Primary competitive factors are the ability to design and cost-effectively manufacture products, system-level knowledge about targeted end markets, software expertise and applications support. Our primary competitors in the DSP market are
Agere Systems, Inc.; Analog Devices, Inc.; Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.; and NXP B.V. Others who offer competing technologies include Broadcom Corp., Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. and QUALCOMM Incorporated.

Other Semiconductor Products

Our
other Semiconductor products, which combined account for about 20 percent of our Semiconductor revenue, include the following:

DLP

®

Products

Our DLP technology is a digital display technology used in projectors and high-definition televisions. Projectors based on this technology are used in businesses, homes,
professional venues and digital cinemas. The technology consists of micro-electromechanical devices that use optical semiconductors to digitally manipulate light. At the center of every DLP product is an array of up to 2.2 million microscopic
mirrors. Each mirror tilts back and forth thousands of times each second to create a high resolution, highly reliable, full color image. This technology is used by more than 70 of the world’s top projector and television manufacturers. Since
early 1996 when DLP products were first marketed, TI has shipped more than 10 million DLP sub-systems to customers all over the world.

Our DLP
technology competes against other display technologies such as liquid crystal display (LCD), plasma and cathode-ray tube (CRT). The primary competitive elements in this market include picture quality, product form factors, versatility and price.

Reduced Instruction-Set Computing (RISC) Microprocessors

A microprocessor is the central processing unit of a computer system. RISC microprocessors are designed to provide very fast computing, typically for a specialized application such as servers. Our RISC products are primarily 64-bit
microprocessors designed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. for use in Sun servers.

Microcontrollers

A microcontroller is a microprocessor designed to control a very specific task for electronic equipment. Key applications for our microcontrollers include automotive,
industrial motors and controls, meters and consumer products. Primary competitive factors in this market include integration of control peripherals for reduced board space and number of components, an integrated development environment for fast
system development and a broad range of microcontroller solutions for upgradeability and flexibility in system design.


Standard Logic

Standard logic devices are chips generally used to manage the interchange and manipulation of signals within a system. A substantial number of our standard logic products are considered commodities, for which price and delivery are the key
competitive factors. We sell thousands of different standard logic products, primarily to distributors. End applications include consumer products and communications.

Royalties

An additional source of revenue for TI is royalties received for our patented technology that we license
to other electronics companies.

Applications for Our Semiconductor Products

The table below lists the major end markets that use our Semiconductor products and the approximate percentage of our Semiconductor revenue that the market represents.
The chart also lists the most frequent applications and our products used within these key markets.

Manufacturing

We have semiconductor manufacturing sites in North America, Japan, Asia and Europe. These facilities include high-volume wafer fabrication plants and assembly/test sites.
Our semiconductor manufacturing facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once they are in operation. Because we own most of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs are
fixed. In general, these costs do not decline when


customer demand or our capacity utilization rates drop, and this can hurt our profit margins. Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization
increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, which should benefit profit margins.

The semiconductor manufacturing process begins with a
thin silicon wafer on which an array of semiconductor devices is fabricated. The wafer is then tested, cut into chips, and assembled into packages that are then individually retested.

Our advanced digital products require the most advanced and most capital-intensive manufacturing processes. DSPs and other digital products tend to move to more advanced production techniques every couple of years.
Consequently, maintaining an industry leadership position requires significant capital expenditures for new manufacturing capabilities.

Our manufacturing
strategy for advanced digital processes is to build internal capacity to a level we believe will remain fully utilized over the equipment’s asset lifetime. We then outsource remaining capacity from outside suppliers, including semiconductor
foundries and assembly/test subcontractors. We also outsource the manufacturing of some products when it would be less cost-efficient to make those products in-house, for instance, relatively low-volume products that are unlikely to keep internal
equipment fully utilized. This internal/external strategy is designed to reduce the level of our required capital expenditures, and thereby reduce our subsequent levels of depreciation. The expected end result is less fluctuation in our profit
margins due to changing product demand. Currently, outside foundries provide about 25 percent of our total wafers produced.

Another element of our
manufacturing strategy is the development of advanced digital manufacturing processes. We have traditionally developed these processes in-house. Moving forward, we will work collaboratively with our foundry suppliers to specify and drive the next
generations of digital process technology instead of separately creating our own process technology. We expect that our 32-nanometer manufacturing process will be the first process technology developed entirely through this new collaboration. This
strategic shift will allow us to better serve customers with cost-effective digital process technology from our foundry suppliers, while increasing the efficiency of our own research and development (R&D) and capital. We will continue to develop
our own analog process technologies.

As we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology, we utilize less space per transistor,
which enables us to either: 1) fit more transistors on an equivalent-size chip, 2) decrease the chip’s size or 3) integrate new features onto the chip. By shrinking the size of transistors, we also can provide faster chips that consume less
power and cost less per unit to manufacture.

Our manufacturing capabilities are on par with the best in the semiconductor industry. As of
December 31, 2006, we have shipped more than half a billion chips manufactured using 90-nanometer process technology, and our 65-nanometer process is in the early stages of production. Our advanced semiconductor R&D is now done side-by-side
with production of 300-millimeter (mm) wafers in our Dallas DMOS 6 fabrication plant. 300-mm wafers greatly expand the number of equivalent chips we can put on a single wafer, compared with the previous 200-mm wafers. Construction of our new 300-mm
wafer fabrication plant in Richardson, Texas (RFAB) has been completed.

In 2006, a majority of our advanced digital products were built using 130- or
90-nanometer manufacturing process technology, while devices using 65-nanometer technology continued to increase throughout the year. One nanometer is one billionth of a meter.

Since analog manufacturing technology evolves more slowly than digital manufacturing technology, analog products typically do not require us to build new manufacturing facilities. This tends to improve the profit
margin on analog products, since the equipment on which they are manufactured is frequently fully depreciated.

Design
Centers

Our design centers provide design, engineering and product application support as well as after-sales customer service design. The design
centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers.

Customers

Our Semiconductor products are sold to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), ODMs, contract
manufacturers and distributors. (An OEM designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures in-house or has manufactured by others.) Our largest single customer in 2006 was an OEM, the Nokia group of companies. Direct sales to Nokia
were more than 10 percent of our revenue in both 2005 and 2006.


Sales and Distribution

We market and sell our products through a direct sales force, distributors and authorized third-party sales representatives. We have sales or marketing offices in over 25
countries worldwide. Distributors, located around the world, account for about 30 percent of our Semiconductor revenue, and they sell our products directly to a wide range of customers. These distributors typically maintain an inventory of our
products. They also sell products from our competitors.

Education Technology Segment

Education Technology is a leading supplier of graphing handheld calculators. This business segment also provides its customers with business and scientific calculators and a wide range of advanced classroom tools and
professional development resources to help students and teachers interactively explore math and science. Education Technology relies on third-party manufacturers to build its products. This segment contributed 4 percent of our 2006 revenue.

Competition

Our
principal competitors in this business are U.S.- and Japan-based companies. The principal competitive factors are an understanding of the education market, technology expertise and price.

Sales and Distribution

Education Technology sells its products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers.

Acquisitions, Divestitures and Investments

From time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or
better focus our business portfolio. We also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies. Investments are focused primarily on next-generation technologies and markets strategic to us.

In January 2006, we closed the acquisition of Chipcon Group ASA, a leading company in the design of short-range, low-power wireless radio-frequency (RF) transceiver
devices. Chipcon’s product line complements our existing high-performance analog, power management and ultra-low-power microcontroller portfolio. We paid $183 million in cash for Chipcon.

In January 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Sensors & Control segment, excluding the radio frequency identification (RFID) systems
operations, to an affiliate of Bain Capital, LLC, for $3 billion in cash. The sale was completed on April 27, 2006. The RFID operations are now included in the Semiconductor business segment.

Backlog

Our backlog of
orders was $1.64 billion at December 31, 2006, and $1.88 billion at December 31, 2005. A substantial number of orders are shipped during the quarter in which they are received. We define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase
orders with a customer-requested delivery date within a maximum length of time. As customer requirements and industry conditions change, orders may be, under certain circumstances, subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing,
quantity or delivery date. Customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities, as well as industry supply and capacity considerations. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at
any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period.

Raw Materials

We purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers. In some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers. The materials, parts and supplies
essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future.

Intellectual Property

We
own many patents, and have many patent applications pending, in the United States and other countries in fields relating to our business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio. We also
have several agreements with other companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future. In general, our license agreements have multi-year terms and may be renewed after renegotiation.


Our Semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to Semiconductor revenue. We do not consider our business
materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license, although taken as a whole, our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business.

We often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards. Our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives. Participation in these initiatives
may require us to license our patents to other companies.

We own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business. These trademarks are valuable
assets, the most important of which are “Texas Instruments” and our corporate monogram. Other valuable trademarks include DLP

®

and OMAP

™

.

Research and Development

Our primary area of R&D investment is semiconductor products and semiconductor manufacturing technology. We conduct most of our R&D internally. However, we also
closely engage with a wide range of external industry consortia and universities and collaborate with our foundry suppliers.

From time to time we may
terminate R&D projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product. We do not expect that all of our R&D projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will
contribute to revenue until at least a few years following completion.

Our R&D expense was $2.20 billion in 2006,
compared with $1.99 billion in 2005 and $1.95 billion in 2004.

Seasonality

Our revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation. Education Technology experiences its strongest results in the second and third quarters in
preparation for the back-to-school season. The Semiconductor segment generally has a weak first quarter, particularly in product areas such as wireless and consumer electronics that have stronger sales later in the year as manufacturers prepare for
the holiday selling season.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors.

You should read the following Risk Factors in
conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings. These Risk Factors are intended to highlight certain
factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like TI with broad international operations. Like other companies, we are susceptible to
macroeconomic downturns in the United States or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in
general market conditions, differences in our results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community, and other factors beyond our control.

Cyclicality in the Semiconductor Market May Affect Our Performance.

Our semiconductor business is our largest business segment and the principal source of our revenue. The semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and
decreases in product demand. These changes could adversely affect our results of operations and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. In particular, our strategic focus in this business is on the development and marketing of
analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors. The results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for analog integrated circuits or digital signal processors decreases or if these markets or key end-equipment
markets such as communications, entertainment electronics and computing grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects.

Our Margins May Vary over Time.

Our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in
our shipment volume, reductions in, or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix. In addition, the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products. Because we own most of
our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed. In general, these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or our utilization of our manufacturing capacity, and can adversely affect profit margins
as a result.

The Technology Industry Is Characterized by Rapid Technological Change That Requires Us to Develop New Technologies and
Products.

Our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly
changing technological environment. We require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that, in turn, may result in shortened product life cycles. Moreover, expenditures for technology and
product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products, that the products we do develop and
market will be well received by customers or that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products.


We Face Substantial Competition That Requires Us to Respond Rapidly to Product Development and Pricing
Pressures.

We face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. We expect that the level of this competition will
increase in the future from large, established semiconductor and related product companies, as well as from emerging companies serving niche markets that we also serve. Certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and
management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against those of our products that currently offer technological and/or price advantages over competitive products. Competition results in price and product development
pressures, which may result in reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match price declines or technological, product, applications support, software or manufacturing advances of our competitors.

Our Performance Depends in Part upon Our Ability to Enforce Our Intellectual Property Rights and to Develop and License New
Intellectual Property.

Access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio. There can be no
assurance that, as our business expands into new areas, we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of
others. We may have to rely increasingly on licensed technology from others. To the extent that we rely on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain all of the licenses we desire in the future on terms we
consider reasonable or at all. The lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunction from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have contractually agreed to
indemnify our customers against damages resulting from infringement claims. We actively enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper
use of the protected technology.

We benefit from royalty revenue generated from various license agreements. Some agreements expired in 2005 and 2006 and
either have been or are currently being renegotiated. Others expire at the end of 2007 and in future years. Although we will attempt to renegotiate license agreements that expire in 2007, there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be
successful. Future royalty revenue depends on the strength of our portfolio and enforcement efforts, and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees. Additionally, the consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty
revenue. Royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable, in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements.

A Decline in Demand in Certain End-User Markets Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Demand for Our Products and Results of Operations.

Our customer base includes companies in a wide range of industries, but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the
communications and computer-related industries. Within these industries, a large portion of our revenue is generated by the sale of analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors to customers in the cell-phone, personal computer and
communications infrastructure markets. Decline in one or several of these end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition.

Our Global Manufacturing, Design and Sales Activities Subject Us to Risks Associated with Legal, Political, Economic or Other Changes.

We have facilities in more than 25 countries worldwide, and in 2006 more than 80 percent of our revenue came from sales to locations outside the United States.
Operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies, as well as the general political and economic conditions, security risks, health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks, of the
various countries in which we operate, which could result in an adverse effect on our business operations in such countries and our results of operations. Also, as discussed in more detail on page 55 of our 2006 annual report to stockholders, we use
forward currency exchange contracts to minimize the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Nevertheless, in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in
relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business, the remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.


Our Results of Operations Could be Affected by Natural Events in the Locations in which We, Our
Customers or Suppliers Operate.

We have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural events such as severe weather and
earthquakes that could disrupt operations. In addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. A natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or our customers’ or suppliers’, may
adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The Loss of or Significant Curtailment of Purchases by Any of Our
Largest Customers Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations.

While we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide, the loss of or
significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers, including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory
adjustments, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Incorrect Forecasts of Customer Demand Could
Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations.

Our ability to match inventory and production mix with the product mix needed to fill current orders and
orders to be delivered in the given quarter may affect our ability to meet that quarter’s revenue forecast. In addition, when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture product based on forecasts of
customers’ demands. These forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. If we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

Our Performance Depends on the Availability and Cost of Raw Materials, Utilities, Critical
Manufacturing Equipment, Manufacturing Processes and Third-Party Manufacturing Services.

Our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing
equipment require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available. Limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, the inability to timely implement new
manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. We subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits. We are also in the process of
transitioning future advanced digital process technology development to third parties. We depend on a limited number of third parties to perform these functions. We do not have long-term contracts with all of these third parties. Reliance on these
third parties involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand and their inability to develop and deliver advanced digital process technology in a timely and appropriate manner.

Our Results of Operations Could be Affected by Changes in Taxation.

We have facilities in more than 25 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. Tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our results of
operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries, or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we
operate.

In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various locations that govern the determination of which is the appropriate jurisdiction
to decide when and how much profit has been earned and is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. Changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of
operations. We have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. Each quarter we forecast
our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year. If that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability will change.

Our Results of Operations Could be Affected by Warranty Claims, Product Recalls or Product Liability.

We could be
subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards. In the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end
consumer. We do maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. In addition, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing
a TI part. In such instances, we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. Costs or payments we may


make in connection with warranty claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our Continued Success Depends in Part on Our Ability to Retain and Recruit a Sufficient Number of Qualified Employees in a Competitive
Environment.

Our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management
and staff personnel. Experienced personnel in the electronics industry are in high demand and competition for their skills is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we
require.

ITEM 2.

Properties.

Our principal executive offices are located at 12500
TI Boulevard, Dallas, Texas. The following table indicates the general location of our principal manufacturing and design operations and the business segments that make major use of them. Except as otherwise indicated, we own these facilities.

(1)

Certain facilities or portions thereof in Dallas and Sherman are leased to Raytheon Company or
Raytheon-related entities in connection with the sale in 1997 of our defense systems and electronics business. Certain portions of our facilities in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia are leased to Sensata Technologies, Inc. or Sensata-related entities in
connection with the sale in 2006 of our Sensors & Controls business.

(2)

Leased.

(3)

All of the land and a portion of the facilities are leased; a portion of the facilities is owned.

(4)

Owned facilities located on leased land.

(5)

Portions of the facilities are leased and owned.

Our facilities in the United States contained approximately 14.2 million square feet at December 31, 2006, of which approximately 1.8 million square feet
were leased. Our facilities outside the United States contained approximately 5.8 million square feet at December 31, 2006, of which approximately 1.4 million square feet were leased.


We believe that our existing properties are in good condition and suitable for their intended purpose. As discussed in
Item 1, we outsource a portion of our product manufacturing. At the end of 2006, we occupied substantially all of the space in our facilities.

Leases
covering our currently occupied leased facilities expire at varying dates generally within the next 10 years. We anticipate no difficulty in retaining occupancy through lease renewals, month-to-month occupancy or purchases of leased facilities, or
replacing the leased facilities with equivalent facilities.

ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, Italian
government auditors completed a review, conducted in the ordinary course, of approximately $250 million of grants from the Italian government to TI’s former memory operations in Italy. The Ministry of Industry, which is responsible for
reviewing the auditors’ findings, has published final decrees on all projects relating to the grants, resulting in a $28 million favorable settlement to TI in the fourth quarter of 2006. As of December 31, 2006, TI has no material
obligations remaining on the grants.

We are involved in various proceedings conducted by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and certain other
governmental environmental agencies regarding clean-up of contaminated sites. These proceedings are being coordinated with the agencies and, in certain cases, with other potentially responsible parties. Although the factual situations and the
progress of each of these matters differ, we believe that the amount of our liability will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

The Internal Revenue Code requires that companies disclose in their Form 10-K whether they have been required to pay penalties to the Internal Revenue Service for
certain transactions that have been identified by the IRS as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose. We have not been required to pay any such penalties.

“Safe Harbor” Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:

This report includes forward-looking statements
intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by phrases such as TI or its management “believes,”
“expects,” “anticipates,” “foresees,” “forecasts,” “estimates” or other words or phrases of similar import. Similarly, statements herein that describe TI’s business strategy, outlook,
objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements. All such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking
statements.

We urge you to carefully consider the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations
of TI or its management:

•

Market demand for semiconductors, particularly for analog chips and digital signal processors in key markets such as communications, entertainment electronics and
computing;

•

TI’s ability to maintain or improve profit margins, including its ability to utilize its manufacturing facilities at sufficient levels to cover its fixed
operating costs, in an intensely competitive and cyclical industry;

•

TI’s ability to develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment;

•

TI’s ability to compete in products and prices in an intensely competitive industry;

•

TI’s ability to maintain and enforce a strong intellectual property portfolio and obtain needed licenses from third parties;

•

Expiration of license agreements between TI and its patent licensees, and market conditions reducing royalty payments to TI;

•

Economic, social and political conditions in the countries in which TI, its customers or its suppliers operate, including security risks, health conditions,
possible disruptions in transportation networks and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

Natural events such as severe weather and earthquakes in the locations in which TI, its customers or suppliers operate;

•

Availability and cost of raw materials, utilities, manufacturing equipment, third-party manufacturing services and manufacturing technology;


•

Changes in the tax rate applicable to TI as the result of changes in tax law, the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed, the outcome
of tax audits and the ability to realize deferred tax assets;

•

Losses or curtailments of purchases from key customers and the timing and amount of distributor and other customer inventory adjustments;

•

Customer demand that differs from company forecasts;

•

The financial impact of inadequate or excess TI inventories to meet demand that differs from projections;

•

Product liability or warranty claims, or recalls by TI customers for a product containing a TI part;

•

TI’s ability to recruit and retain skilled personnel; and

•

Timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies, installation of manufacturing equipment and the ability to obtain needed third-party foundry and
assembly/test subcontract services.

For a more detailed discussion of these factors see the Risk Factors discussion in Item 1A of
this report. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date of this report and TI undertakes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
