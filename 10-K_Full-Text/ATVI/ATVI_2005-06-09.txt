PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

(a)

General

Activision, Inc. (“Activision” or “we”) is a leading international
publisher of interactive entertainment software products.  We have built a company with a diverse
portfolio of products that spans a wide range of categories and target markets
and that is used on a variety of game hardware platforms and operating
systems.  We have created, licensed and
acquired a group of highly recognizable brands, which we market to a variety of
consumer demographics.  Our fiscal 2005
product portfolio included such best-selling products as

Spider-Man 2: 
The Movie (“Spider-Man 2”), Shrek 2, Tony Hawk’s Underground 2 (“THUG 2”),
Call of Duty:  Finest Hour, Shark Tale,
DOOM 3

and

X-Men Legends

.

Our products cover diverse game categories including action/adventure,
action sports, racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person action and
strategy.  Our target customer base
ranges from casual players to game enthusiasts, children to adults and
mass-market consumers to “value” buyers. 
We currently offer our products primarily in versions that operate on
the Sony PlayStation 2 (“PS2”), Nintendo GameCube (“GameCube”) and Microsoft
Xbox (“Xbox”) console systems, Nintendo Game Boy Advance (“GBA”), Sony
PlayStation Portable (“PSP”) and Nintendo Dual Screen (“NDS”) hand-held devices
and the personal computer (“PC”).  The
installed base for this current generation of hardware platforms is significant
and growing and the fiscal 2005 release of two new handheld devices, NDS, which
was released worldwide, and PSP, which was released in North America, will also
help expand the software market.  We
successfully executed our strategy of having a high-quality product presence at
the launch of the NDS and PSP and are currently developing additional titles
for the PSP and the NDS while continuing to develop games for the GBA.

We also intend to develop titles for the next-generation console
systems which are being developed by Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft.  Microsoft recently unveiled its
next-generation console, the Xbox 360, which is expected to be released in November 2005.  We are currently developing four titles for
release on the Xbox 360,

Tony Hawk’s
American Wasteland, Call of Duty 2, Quake IV

and

GUN.

Sony
and Nintendo also recently unveiled their next-generation consoles, the
PlayStation 3 and Revolution, respectively, and both are expected to be
released in calendar 2006.  Our
publishing business involves the development, marketing, and sale of products
directly, by license or through our affiliate label program with certain
third-party publishers.  Our distribution
business consists of operations in Europe that provide logistical and sales
services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our
own publishing operations and manufacturers of interactive entertainment
hardware.

We were originally incorporated in California in 1979.  In December 1992, we reincorporated in
Delaware.  In June 2000, we
reorganized into the current holding company organizational structure.

In April 2003, the Board of Directors
approved a three-for-two split of our outstanding common shares effected in the
form of a 50% stock dividend.  The split
was paid on June 6, 2003 to shareholders of record as of May 16,
2003.  In February 2004, the Board
of Directors approved a three-for-two split of our outstanding common shares
effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. 
The split was paid on March 15, 2004 to shareholders of record as of
February 23, 2004.  In February 2005,
the Board of Directors approved a four-for-three split of our outstanding
common shares effected in the form of a 33-1/3% stock dividend.  The split was paid March 22, 2005 to
shareholders of record as of March 7, 2005.  The par value of our common stock was
maintained at the pre-split amount of $.000001.   All share and per share data have been
restated as if the stock splits had occurred as of the earliest period
presented.

(b)

Business
Combinations

We have completed a number of acquisitions of both software development
companies and interactive entertainment product distribution companies.    During fiscal 2005, we continued to enhance
our internal product development capabilities with the acquisition of a game developer,
Vicarious Visions, Inc.  See the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
for additional information regarding the accounting treatment of this and prior
acquisitions.   During the first quarter
of fiscal 2006, we acquired two additional game developers, Toys for Bob, Inc.
and Beenox, Inc.


(c)

Financial
Information About Industry Segments

We have two reportable segments: publishing and distribution.  Publishing relates to the development (both
internally and externally), marketing and sale of DVD, CD, UMD and
cartridge-based interactive entertainment software products owned or controlled
by us directly, by license or through our affiliate label program with certain
third-party publishers.  Distribution
primarily refers to logistical and sales services provided by our European
distribution subsidiaries to third-party publishers of interactive
entertainment software, our own publishing operations and manufacturers of
interactive entertainment hardware.  See
Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain financial information regarding
reporting segment and geographic areas required by Item 1.

Narrative
Description of Business

Our objective is to be a worldwide leader in the development,
publishing and distribution of quality interactive entertainment software
products that deliver a highly satisfying consumer entertainment experience.  Our business strategy, the key components of
our business operations and the risk factors that could impact our business are
detailed below.

Strategy

Create, Acquire and Maintain Strong Brands.

We focus development and publishing
activities principally on products that are, or have the potential to become,
franchise properties with sustainable consumer appeal and brand
recognition.  It is our experience that
these products can then serve as the basis for sequels, prequels and related
new products that can be released over an extended period of time. We believe
that the publishing and distribution of products based in large part on
franchise properties enhances predictability of revenues and the probability of
high unit volume sales and operating profits. We have entered into a series of
strategic relationships with the owners of intellectual property pursuant to
which we have acquired the rights to publish products based on franchises such
as Marvel Comics’ properties, including Spider-Man, X-Men, Iron Man and
Fantastic Four.  Additionally, we have a multi-year, multi-property,
publishing agreement with DreamWorks LLC that grants us the exclusive rights to
publish video games based on DreamWorks Animation SKG’s theatrical release “Shrek
2,” which was released in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, “Shark Tale,” which
was released in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, “Madagascar,” which was
released in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, as well as the upcoming
computer-animated film “Over the Hedge” and all of their respective sequels,
including “Shrek 3.”  We also have
a strategic relationship with professional skateboarder Tony Hawk through an
exclusive multi-year agreement to develop video games using his name and
likeness.  Through fiscal 2005, we have released
six successful titles in the Tony Hawk franchise.  We also have created a number of successful
internally developed intellectual properties such as the True Crime and Call of
Duty franchise properties.  We believe
that our fiscal 2006 release,

GUN,

also
has the potential to join this list of franchise properties.

Execute Disciplined Product Selection and Development Processes.

The success of our publishing business
depends, in significant part, on our ability to develop high quality games that
will generate high unit volume sales.  
Our publishing units have implemented a formal control process for the
selection, development, production and quality assurance of our products. We
apply this process, which we refer to as the “Greenlight Process,” to all of
our products, whether externally or internally developed. The Greenlight
Process includes in-depth reviews of each project at six important stages of
development by a team that includes many of our highest-ranking operating
managers and coordination between our sales and marketing personnel and
development staff at each step in the process.

We develop our products using a combination of our internal development
resources and external development resources acting under contract with
us.  We typically select our external
developers based on their track record and expertise in producing products in
the same category. One developer will often produce the same game for multiple
platforms and will produce sequels to the original game. We believe that selecting
and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the
particular expertise of our internal and external development resources, which
we believe adds to the quality of our products.

Create and Maintain Diversity in Product Mix, Platforms and Markets.

We believe that maintaining a diversified mix
of products can reduce our operating risks and enhance profitability.
Therefore, we develop and publish products spanning a wide range of product
categories, including action/adventure, action sports, racing, role-playing,
simulation, first-person action and strategy. 
We also develop products designed for target audiences ranging


from casual players to game enthusiasts,
children to adults and mass-market consumers to “value” buyers.  Presently, we concentrate on developing,
publishing and distributing products that operate on PS2, GameCube and Xbox
console systems, GBA, PSP, and NDS hand-held devices and the PC.  We intend to develop products for the
next-generation console systems: Microsoft Xbox 360, Sony PlayStation 3 and
Nintendo Revolution. We typically offer our products for use on multiple
platforms in order to reduce the risks associated with any single platform,
leverage our costs over a larger installed hardware base and increase unit
sales.

Continue to Improve Profitability.

We continually strive to manage risk and
increase our operating leverage and efficiency with the goal of increased
profitability. We believe the key factor affecting our future profitability
will be the success rate of our product releases. Therefore, our product
selection and development process includes, as a significant component,
periodic evaluations of the expected commercial success of products under development.
Through this process, for titles that we determine to be less promising,
corrections are made in the development process or, if necessary, they are
discontinued before we incur additional development costs. In addition, we
believe our focus on cross platform releases and branded products will
contribute to improved profitability.

We continue to focus on increasing our margins. We have, for example,
acquired certain experienced and specialized developers in instances where we
can enhance profitability through the elimination of royalty obligations.  Additionally, we often rely on independent
third-party interactive entertainment software developers to develop some of
our software products, thereby taking advantage of specialized independent
developers without incurring the fixed overhead obligations associated with
increased internally employed staff.

Our sales and marketing staff work with our studio resources to
increase the visibility of new product launches and to coordinate the timing
and promotion of product releases. Our finance and sales and marketing
personnel work together to improve inventory management and receivables
collections. We have instituted broad, objective-based reward programs that
provide incentives to management and staff throughout the organization to
produce results that meet our financial objectives.

Grow Through Continued Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances.

The interactive entertainment industry has
been consolidating, and we believe that success in this industry will be driven
in part by the ability to take advantage of scale. Specifically, smaller
companies are more capital constrained, enjoy less predictability of revenues
and cash flow, lack product diversity and must spread fixed costs over a
smaller revenue base. Several industry leaders are emerging that combine the
entrepreneurial and creative spirit of the industry with professional
management, the ability to access the capital markets and the ability to
maintain favorable relationships with developers, intellectual property owners
and retailers. Through numerous completed acquisitions since 1997, we believe
that we have successfully diversified our operations, our channels of
distribution, our development talent pool and our library of titles, and have
emerged as one of the industry’s leaders. We intend to continue to evaluate the
expansion of our resources through acquisitions, strategic relationships and
key license transactions. We intend to continue expanding our intellectual
property library through key license transactions and strategic relationships
with intellectual property owners and to continue to evaluate opportunities to
increase our development capacity through the acquisition of or investment in
selected experienced software development firms.

Products

Historically we have been best known for our action/adventure, strategy
and simulation products.  We have also
been successful in the superheroes and skateboarding categories with our
release of titles based on the Spider-Man and X-Men properties, as well as the
Tony Hawk franchise.  We have also been
successful in the racing and first person action categories through two
original intellectual properties, True Crime

and Call of Duty

,

both
of which we plan on continuing as successful long-term franchises.  In addition, we have established ourselves as
a leader in the “value” software publishing business with products under our
Cabela’s, Rapala’s and Greg Hasting’s

Paintball
licenses, as well as with products distributed on behalf of our “value”
affiliate label partners.   Products
published by us in this category are generally developed by third-parties,
often under contract with us, and are marketed under the Activision Value
Publishing name.  Value software is
typically less sophisticated and less complex, both in terms of the development
process and consumer gameplay.

Hardware Licenses.

Our products currently are
being developed or published primarily for PS2, Xbox and GameCube console
systems; GBA, PSP and NDS hand-held devices; and PCs.  We also intend to develop products for the
next-generation console systems: Microsoft Xbox 360, Sony PlayStation 3 and
Nintendo Revolution.  In order to
maintain general access to the console systems and hand-held devices marketplace,
we have maintained licenses for PS2, GameCube and Xbox console systems and GBA,
PSP and NDS hand-held devices with the owners of each such


platform. 
Each license allows us to create multiple products for the applicable
platform, subject to certain approval rights which are reserved by each
licensor.  Each license also requires
that we pay the licensor a per unit royalty for each unit manufactured.  In contrast, we are not required to obtain
any license for the development and production of products for PCs.

Intellectual Property Rights.

Many of our current and planned releases are
based on intellectual property and other character or story rights licensed
from third-parties, as well as a combination of characters, worlds and concepts
derived from our extensive library of titles, and original characters and
concepts owned and created by us.  When
publishing products based on licensed intellectual property rights, we
generally seek to capitalize on the name recognition, marketing efforts and
goodwill associated with the underlying property. For intellectual property
owned by Activision, we generally attempt to establish such properties as
sustainable, long-term game franchises.

In acquiring intellectual property rights from third-parties, we seek
to obtain rights to publish titles across a variety of platforms, to include
the ability to produce multiple titles and to retain rights over an extended
period of time.  In past years, we have
been able to enter into a series of long-term or multi-product agreements with
owners of various intellectual properties that are well known throughout the
world and to create products based on these recognizable characters, story
lines or concepts.  These agreements typically
provide us with exclusive publishing rights for a specific period of time and,
in some cases, for specified platforms and, in other cases, with renewal rights
upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The scope of our licensing
activities includes theatrical motion pictures, television shows, animated
films and series, comic books, literary works, sports personalities and events
and celebrities. We intend to continue expanding relationships with our
existing intellectual property partners and to enter into agreements with other
intellectual property owners for additional recognizable properties,
characters, story lines and concepts. 
However, we may not be able to maintain or expand our existing
relationships or to seek out and sustain new long-term relationships of similar
caliber in the future.

Product Development and Support

We develop and produce titles using a model in which a core group of
creative, production and technical professionals, in coordination with our
marketing and finance departments, have responsibility for the entire
development and production process including the supervision and coordination
of internal and external resources.  This
team assembles the necessary creative elements to complete a title using, where
appropriate, outside programmers, artists, animators, scriptwriters, musicians
and songwriters, sound effects and special effects experts, and sound and video
studios.  We believe that this model
allows us to supplement internal expertise with top quality external resources
on an as-needed basis.

In addition, we often seek out and engage independent third-party
developers to create products on our behalf. 
Such products are sometimes owned by us, and usually we have unlimited
rights to commercially exploit these products. 
In other circumstances, the third-party developer may retain ownership
of the intellectual property and/or technology included in the product and
reserve certain exploitation rights. We typically select these independent
third-party developers based on their expertise in developing products in a
specific category and use the same developer to produce the same game for
multiple platforms.  Each of our
third-party developers is under contract with us for specific or multiple
titles.  From time to time, we also
acquire the license rights to publish and/or distribute software products that
are or will be independently created by third-party developers.  In such cases, the agreements with such
developers provide us with exclusive publishing and/or distribution rights for
a specific period of time, often for specified platforms and territories.  In either case, we often have the ability to
publish and/or distribute sequels, conversions, enhancements and add-ons to the
product initially being produced by the independent developer and frequently
have the right to engage the services of the original developer with regard to
the development of such products.

In consideration for the services that the independent third-party
developer provides, it receives a royalty generally based on net sales of the
product that it has developed. 
Typically, the developer also receives an advance, which we recoup from
the royalties otherwise payable to the developer.  The advance generally is paid in “milestone”
stages. The payment at each stage is tied to the completion and delivery of a
detailed performance milestone.  Working
with an independent developer allows us to reduce our fixed development costs,
share development risks with the third-party developer, take advantage of the
third-party developer’s expertise in connection with certain categories of
products or certain platforms, and gain access to proprietary development
technologies.

From time to time, we may make a capital investment and hold a minority
interest in a third-party developer in connection with interactive
entertainment software products to be developed by such developer for us, which
we


believe helps to create a closer relationship
between us and the developer.  We account
for those capital investments over which we have the ability to exercise
significant influence using the equity method. 
For those investments over which we do not have the ability to exercise
significant influence, we account for our investment using the cost
method.  There can be no assurance that
we will realize long-term benefits from such investments or that we will
continue to carry such investments at their current value.

“Greenlight Process”

We have adopted and implemented a rigorous procedure for the selection,
development, production and quality assurance of our internally and externally
produced interactive entertainment software titles. The process, known
internally as the “Greenlight Process,” involves six phases throughout the
development and production phases of a title, each of which includes a number
of specific performance milestones.  The
six phases of the “Greenlight Process” are the concept, assessment, prototype,
first playable, alpha and beta.  This
procedure is designed to enable us to manage and control production and
development budgets and timetables, to identify and address production and
technical issues at the earliest opportunity, and to coordinate marketing and
quality control strategies throughout the production and development phases,
all in an environment that fosters creativity. 
Checks and balances are intended to be provided through the structured
interaction of the project team with our creative, technical, marketing and
quality assurance/customer support personnel, as well as our legal, accounting
and finance departments.  In order to
maintain the competitiveness of our products and to take advantage of
increasingly sophisticated technology associated with hardware platforms, our
development process includes a significant amount of time for play-testing new
products and extensive product quality evaluations.

Product Support

We provide various forms of product support to both our internally and
externally developed titles.  Our quality
assurance personnel are involved throughout the development and production of
each title published by us.  We subject
all such products to extensive testing before release to ensure compatibility
with all appropriate hardware systems and configurations and to minimize the number
of bugs and other defects found in the products.  To support our products after release, we
provide online access to our customers on a 24-hour basis as well as telephone
operator help lines during regular business hours.  The customer support group tracks customer
inquiries, and we use this data to help improve the development and production
processes.

Publishing Activities

Marketing

Our marketing efforts include online activities (such as the creation
of World Wide Web pages to promote specific titles), public relations,
print and broadcast advertising, coordinated in-store and industry promotions
(including merchandising and point of purchase displays), participation in
cooperative advertising programs, direct response vehicles, and product
sampling through demonstration software distributed through the Internet or on
compact discs.  From time to time, we
also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers and retailers in
connection with their own promotional efforts. 
In addition, certain of our products contain software that enables
customers to “electronically register” their purchases with us online.

We believe that certain of our franchise properties have loyal and
devoted audiences who purchase our sequels as a result of dedication to the
property and satisfaction from previous product purchases.  We therefore market these sequels both toward
the established market as well as broader audiences.  In addition, in marketing titles based on
licensed properties, we believe that we derive benefits from the continued
exploitation of these licensed properties and the marketing and promotional
activities of the property owners.

Sales and Distribution

North America.

Our products are available for sale or rental in thousands of retail
outlets domestically.  Our North American
customers include Best Buy, Blockbuster, Circuit City, Electronics Boutique,
GameStop, Target, Toys “R” Us and Wal-Mart. 
Our largest customer, Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 23% and 20%
of our consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.

In the United States and Canada, our products are sold primarily on a
direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount
warehouses and game specialty stores.  We
believe that a direct relationship


with retail accounts results in more
effective inventory management, merchandising and communications than would be
possible through indirect relationships. 
We have implemented electronic data interchange linkages with many of
our retailers to facilitate the placing and shipping of orders.  We sell our products to a limited number of
distributors.

International.

Our products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis,
through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements, and through our
wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries.  We conduct our international publishing
activities through offices in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy,
Spain, the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden, Australia and Japan.  Whenever practicable, we seek to maximize our
worldwide revenues and profits by releasing high quality foreign language
releases concurrently with English language releases and by continuing to
expand the number of direct selling relationships we maintain with key
retailers in major territories.

Affiliate Labels.

In addition to our own products, we
distribute a select number of interactive entertainment products that are
developed and marketed by other third-party publishers through our “affiliate
label” programs in North America and Europe. The distribution of other
publishers’ products allows us to increase the efficiencies of our sales force
and provides us with the ability to better ensure adequate shelf presence at
retail stores for all of the products that we distribute. Distributing other
publishers’ titles mitigates the risk associated with a particular title or
titles published by us failing to achieve expectations. Services provided by us
under our affiliate label program include order solicitation, in-store
marketing, logistics and order fulfillment, sales channel management, as well
as other accounting and general administrative functions. Our current affiliate
label partners include LucasArts, as well several affiliate label partners in
our “value” business. Each affiliate label relationship is unique and may
pertain only to distribution in certain geographic territories such as the
United States or Europe and may be further limited only to specific titles or
titles for specific platforms.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain financial information
regarding reporting segments and geographic areas required by Item 1.

Distribution

We distribute interactive entertainment hardware and software products
in Europe through our European distribution subsidiaries, Centresoft in the
United Kingdom, NBG in Germany and CD Contact in the Benelux countries.  These subsidiaries act as wholesalers in the
distribution of products and also provide packaging, logistical and sales
services, and in some cases, product localization for certain vendors.  They provide services to our publishing
operations and to various third-party publishers, including Sony, Nintendo and
Microsoft.  Centresoft is Sony’s
exclusive distributor of PlayStation products to the independent channel in the
United Kingdom.  In the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2005, sales for Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft accounted for
approximately 18%, 4% and 3%, respectively, of our worldwide distribution net
revenues.

We entered into the distribution business to obtain distribution
capacity in Europe for our own products, while supporting the distribution
infrastructure with third-party sales, and to diversify our operations into the
European market.  Centresoft and our
other distribution subsidiaries operate in accordance with strict
confidentiality procedures in order to provide independent services to various
third-party publishers.

Emerging Technologies

We are actively supporting emerging platforms (wireless devices, closed
and open online networks and interactive television) by publishing and
licensing key brands, such as

Shrek 2

,

Tony Hawk’s Underground 2

and

Call of Duty

for these emerging platforms.
 We also develop and optimize many of our
titles for consoles that support online play, such as PS2, Xbox Live, and the
up-coming next-generation consoles, Microsoft Xbox 360, Sony PlayStation 3, and
Nintendo Revolution.  We have published
and licensed rights to various brands, such as

Spider-Man
2: The Movie, Shrek 2, Call of Duty

and

X-Men Legends,

for various hand-held wireless devices, such
as Nokia’s N-Gage wireless platform, as well as many traditional wireless
handsets.  We believe that more of our
brands ca

n
be successfully published for wireless and online platforms, as well as
exploited through other emerging technologies, as they continue to evolve.

Manufacturing

We prepare a set of master program copies, documentation and packaging
materials for our products for each hardware platform on which the product will
be released.  Except with respect to
products for use on the Sony,


Nintendo and Microsoft systems, our disk
duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly and
shipping are performed by third-party subcontractors.

To maintain protection over their hardware technologies, Sony, Nintendo
and Microsoft generally specify or control the manufacturing and assembly of
finished products. We deliver the master materials to the licensor or its
approved replicator, which then manufactures finished goods and delivers them
to us for distribution under our label. 
At the time our product unit orders are filled by the manufacturer, we
become responsible for the costs of manufacturing and the applicable per unit
royalty on such units, even if the units do not ultimately sell.

To date, we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in
the manufacture and assembly of our products or material returns due to product
defects.

Competition

The interactive entertainment software industry is intensely
competitive and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms
are regularly introduced.  Our
competitors vary in size from small companies with limited resources to very
large corporations with significantly greater financial, marketing and product
development resources than we have.  Due
to their greater resources, certain of our competitors can spend more money and
time on developing and testing products, undertake more extensive marketing
campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, pay higher fees to licensors
for desirable motion picture, television, sports and character properties and
pay more to third-party software developers than we can.  In addition, competitors with larger product
lines and popular titles typically have greater leverage with retailers,
distributors and other customers who may be willing to promote titles with less
consumer appeal in return for access to such competitor’s most popular
titles.  We believe that the main
competitive factors in the interactive entertainment software industry include:
product features and playability; brand name recognition; compatibility of
products with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; quality of
products; ease of use; price; marketing support; and quality of customer
service.

We compete primarily with other publishers of personal computer and
video game console interactive entertainment software.  Significant third-party software competitors
currently include, among others: Atari, Inc.; Capcom Co. Ltd.; Eidos PLC;
Electronic Arts Inc.; Konami Company Ltd.; Namco Ltd.; Sega Enterprises, Ltd.;
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.; THQ Inc.; Ubi Soft Entertainment; and
Vivendi Universal Publishing.  In
addition, integrated video game console hardware and software companies such as
Sony Computer Entertainment, Nintendo Co. Ltd. and Microsoft Corporation
compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their
respective platforms.

Employees

As of March 31, 2005, we had 1,728 employees, including 984 in
product development, 154 in North American publishing, 138 in international
publishing, 121 in operations, corporate finance and administration, and 331 in
European distribution activities.

As of March 31, 2005, 234 of our full-time employees were subject
to term employment agreements with us. 
These agreements generally commit such employees to employment terms of
between one and five years from the commencement of their respective
agreements.  Most of the employees
subject to such agreements are executive officers or key members of the product
development, sales or marketing divisions. 
These individuals perform services for us as executives, directors, producers,
associate producers, computer programmers, game designers, sales directors and
marketing product managers.  The
execution by us of employment agreements with such employees, in our
experience, reduces our turnover during the development, production and
distribution phases of our entertainment software products and allows us to
plan more effectively for future development and marketing activities.

None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement
except for the employees of our German distribution subsidiary who are allowed
by German law to belong to an organized labor council.  To date, we have not experienced any
labor-related work stoppages.

Factors Affecting Future Performance

In connection with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
(the “Litigation Reform Act”), we are hereby disclosing certain cautionary
information to be used in connection with written materials (including this
Annual Report on Form 10-K) and oral statements made by or on behalf of

We depend on a relatively small
number of brands for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.

A significant portion of our revenues is derived from products based on
a relatively small number of popular brands each year, and these products are
responsible for a disproportionate amount of our profits.  In addition, many of these products have
substantial production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets.  In fiscal 2005, 37% of our consolidated net
revenues (48% of worldwide publishing net revenues) was derived from three
brands, which accounted for 16%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of consolidated net
revenues (21%, 14% and 13%, respectively, of worldwide publishing net
revenues).  In fiscal 2004, 35% of our
consolidated net revenues (49% of worldwide publishing net revenues) was
derived from three brands, which accounted for 17%, 14% and 4%, respectively,
of consolidated net revenues (24%, 20% and 5%, respectively, of worldwide
publishing net revenues).  In fiscal
2003, two brands accounted for 38% of our consolidated net revenues (52% of
worldwide publishing net revenues), one of which accounted for 20% and the
other of which accounted for 18% of consolidated net revenues (27% and 25%,
respectively, of worldwide publishing net revenues).  We expect that a limited number of popular
brands will continue to produce a disproportionately large amount of our
revenues and profits.  Due to this
dependence on a limited number of brands, the failure to achieve anticipated
results by one or more products based on these brands may significantly harm
our business and financial results.

Our future success depends on our ability to release popular
products.

The life of any one game product is relatively short, in many cases
less than one year.  It is therefore
important for us to be able to continue to develop many high quality new
products that are popularly received.  We
focus our development and publishing activities principally on products that
are, or have the potential to become, franchise brand properties.  If we are unable to do this, our business and
financial results may be negatively affected.

If we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to
intellectual property, we may publish fewer “hit” titles and our revenue may
decline.

Many of our products are based on intellectual property and other
character or story rights acquired or licensed from third-parties.  These license and distribution agreements are
limited in scope and time, and we may not be able to renew key licenses when
they expire or to include new products in existing licenses.  The loss of a significant number of our
intellectual property licenses or of our relationships with licensors, or inability
to obtain additional licenses of significant commercial value could have a
material adverse effect on our ability to develop new products and therefore on
our business and financial results. 
Additionally, the failure of intellectual property acquired by us to be
popularly received could impact the market acceptance of our products in which
the intellectual property is included. 
Such lack of market acceptance could result in the write-off of the
unrecovered portion of acquired intellectual property assets, which could cause
material harm to our business and financial results.  Furthermore, the competition for these
licenses and distribution agreements is often intense.  Competition for these licenses may also drive
up the advances, guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor, which
could increase our costs.

Transitions in console platforms could have a material
impact on the market for interactive entertainment software.

When new console platforms are announced or introduced into the market,
consumers typically reduce their purchases of game console entertainment
software products for current console platforms in anticipation of new
platforms becoming available.  During
these periods, sales of our game console entertainment software products may be
expected to slow or even decline until new platforms are introduced and achieve
wide consumer acceptance.  In fiscal
2005, Nintendo released its latest portable game system, the NDS, and Sony
released the PSP in North America.  We
began selling games for each of these hand-held platforms concurrently with
their respective launches and are


currently developing additional titles for
the PSP and NDS.  The introduction of the
PSP and NDS may have a negative effect on the sale of our GBA titles.  We also intend to develop titles for the
next-generation console systems being developed by Sony, Nintendo and
Microsoft.   Microsoft recently unveiled
their next-generation console, the Xbox 360, which is expected to be released
in November 2005.  Sony and Nintendo
also recently unveiled their next-generation consoles, the PlayStation 3 and
Revolution, respectively, and both are expected to be released in calendar
2006.  Delays in the launch, shortages,
technical problems or lack of consumer acceptance of the next-generation
platforms could adversely affect our sales of products for these
platforms.  In addition, as console
hardware moves through its life cycle, hardware manufacturers typically enact
price reductions, and decreasing prices may put downward pressure on our
software prices.

We must make significant expenditures to develop products
for new platforms which may not be successful or released when anticipated.

The interactive entertainment software industry is subject to rapid
technological change.  New technologies
could render our current products or products in development obsolete or
unmarketable.  We must continually
anticipate and assess the emergence and market acceptance of new interactive
entertainment hardware platforms well in advance of the time the platform is
introduced to consumers.  New platforms
have historically required the development of new software and also have the
effect of undermining demand for products based on older technologies.  Because product development cycles are
difficult to predict, we must make substantial product development and other
investments in a particular platform well in advance of introduction of the
platform and we may be required to realign our product portfolio and
development efforts in response to market changes.  If the platforms for which we develop new
software products or modify existing products are not released on a timely
basis, do not attain significant market penetration, if we develop products for
a delayed or unsuccessful platform or if we cancel development of products in
response to market changes, we may not be able to recover in revenues our
development costs, which could be significant, and our business and financial
results could be significantly harmed.

We are exposed to seasonality in the purchases of our
products.

The interactive entertainment software industry is highly seasonal,
with the highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the year end
holiday buying season.  As a result, our
net revenues, gross profits and operating income have historically been highest
during the second half of the calendar year. 
Additionally, in a platform transition period, sales of game console
software products can be significantly affected by the timeliness of
introduction of game console platforms by the manufacturers of those platforms,
such as Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft. 
The timing of hardware platform introduction is also often tied to
holidays and is not within our control. 
If a hardware platform is released unexpectedly close to the holidays,
this would result in a shortened holiday buying season and could negatively
impact the sales of our products. 
Further, delays in development, licensor approvals or manufacturing can
also affect the timing of the release of our products, causing us to miss key
selling periods such as the year end holiday buying season.

We depend on skilled personnel.

Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify,
hire and retain skilled personnel.  The
software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and
aggressive recruiting among competitors for personnel with technical,
marketing, sales, product development and management skills.  We may not be able to attract and retain
skilled personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do so.  If we are unable to attract additional
qualified employees or retain the services of key personnel, our business and
financial results could be negatively impacted.

Our platform licensors are
our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of and have
broad approval rights over our video game products.

Generally, when we develop interactive entertainment software products
for hardware platforms offered by Sony, Nintendo or Microsoft, the products are
manufactured exclusively by that hardware manufacturer or their approved
replicator.

Our agreements with these manufacturers include certain provisions,
such as approval rights over all products and related promotional materials and
the ability to change the fee they charge for the manufacturing of products,
that allow them substantial influence over our costs and the release schedule of
our products.  In addition, since each of
the manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware platforms and
manufactures products for all of its


other licensees, a manufacturer may give
priority to its own products or those of our competitors in the event of
insufficient manufacturing capacity. 
Accordingly, Sony, Nintendo or Microsoft could cause unanticipated
delays in the release of our products as well as increases to our development,
manufacturing, marketing or distribution costs, which could materially harm our
business and financial results.

In addition, as online capabilities for video game
platforms emerge, our platform licensors will control our ability to provide
online game capabilities for our console platform products and will in large
part establish the financial terms on which these services are offered to
consumers.  Currently, both Microsoft and
Sony provide online capabilities for Xbox and PS2 products, respectively.  In each case, compatibility code and the
consent of the licensor are required for us to include online capabilities in
our products.  In addition, the business
model for Microsoft’s and Sony’s online businesses for their video game
products may compete with our online business. As these capabilities become
more significant, the failure or refusal of our licensors to approve our
products, or the successful deployment by these licensors of services
competitive to ours, may harm our business.

Our platform licensors set
the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their
platforms, and therefore have significant influence on our costs.

We pay a licensing fee to the hardware manufacturer
for each copy of a product manufactured for that manufacturer’s game
platform.  In the next year, we expect
our platform licensors to introduce new hardware platforms into the
market.  In order to publish products for
new hardware platforms, we must take a license from the platform licensor which
gives the platform licensor the opportunity to set the fee structure that we
must pay in order to publish games for that platform.  Similarly, the platform licensors have
retained the flexibility to change their fee structures for online gameplay and
features for their consoles and the manufacturing of products.  The control that platform licensors have over
the fee structures for their future platforms and online access makes it
difficult for us to predict our costs and profitability in the medium to long
term.  Because publishing products for
console systems is the largest portion of our business, any increase in fee
structures would have a significant negative impact on our business model and
profitability.

If our products contain defects, our business could be
harmed significantly.

Software products as complex as the ones we publish may contain
undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions are released.  Despite extensive testing prior to release,
we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in new products or releases
after shipment, that could result in loss of or delay in market
acceptance.  This loss or delay could
significantly harm our business and financial results.

Inadequate intellectual property protections could prevent
us from enforcing or defending our proprietary technology.

We regard our software as proprietary and rely on a combination of
copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, employee and third-party
nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary
rights.  We own or license various
copyrights and trademarks.  Although we
provide “shrink-wrap” license agreements or limitations on use with our
software, it is uncertain to what extent these agreements and limitations are
enforceable.  We are aware that some
unauthorized copying occurs within the computer software industry, and if a significantly
greater amount of unauthorized copying of our interactive entertainment
software products were to occur, it could cause material harm to our business
and financial results.

Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and software
piracy is a persistent problem, especially in some international markets.  Further, the laws of some countries where our
products are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and
intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United
States, or are poorly enforced.  Legal
protection of our rights may be ineffective in such countries.  Moreover, as we leverage our software
products using emerging technologies such as the Internet and online services,
our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing
intellectual property rights of others may diminish.  We cannot be certain that existing
intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in
connection with these emerging technologies.

We may be subject to intellectual property claims.

As the number of interactive entertainment software products increases
and the features and content of these products continue to overlap, software
developers increasingly may become subject to infringement claims.  Many of our products are highly realistic and
feature materials that are based on real world examples, which may
inadvertently


infringe upon the intellectual property
rights of others.  Our products often
utilize complex, cutting edge technology that may become subject to the
intellectual property rights of others. 
Although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our
products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others, it is
possible that third-parties still may claim infringement.  From time to time, we receive communications
from third-parties regarding such claims. 
Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid or not,
may be time consuming and expensive to defend.

Intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or
more of the following:

•

Cease selling,
incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged
intellectual property;

•

Obtain a license
from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which if available at
all, may not be available on commercially favorable terms; or

•

Redesign the
effected interactive entertainment software products, which could cause us to
incur additional costs, delay introduction and possibly reduce commercial
appeal of our products.

Any of these actions may cause material harm
to our business and financial results.

We rely on independent third-parties to develop some of our
software products.

We rely on independent third-party interactive entertainment software
developers to develop some of our software products.  Since we depend on these developers, in the
aggregate, we remain subject to the following risks:

•

Continuing
strong demand for developers’ resources, combined with the recognition they
receive in connection with their work, may cause developers who worked for us
in the past either to work for our competitors in the future or to renegotiate
our agreements with them on terms less favorable for us;

•

Limited
financial resources and business expertise and inability to retain skilled
personnel may force developers out of business prior to completing our products
or require us to fund additional costs; and

•

Our competitors
may acquire the businesses of key developers or sign them to exclusive
development arrangements.  In either
case, we would not be able to continue to engage such developers’ services for
our products, except for those that they are contractually obligated to
complete for us.

Increased competition for skilled third-party software developers also
has compelled us to agree to make significant advance payments on royalties to
game developers.  If the products subject
to these arrangements do not generate sufficient revenues to recover these
royalty advances, we would have to write-off unrecovered portions of these
payments, which could cause material harm to our business and financial
results.  Typically, we pay developers a
royalty based on a percentage of net revenues, less agreed upon deductions, but
in a few cases, we have agreed to pay developers fixed per unit product
royalties after royalty advances are fully recouped.  To the extent that sales prices of products
on which we have agreed to pay a fixed per unit royalty are marked down, our
profitability could be adversely affected.

We operate in a highly competitive industry.

The interactive entertainment software industry is intensely
competitive and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms
are regularly introduced.  Our competitors
vary in size from small companies with limited resources to very large
corporations with significantly greater financial, marketing and product
development resources than we have.  Due
to these greater resources, certain of our competitors can spend more money and
time on developing and testing products, undertake more extensive marketing
campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, pay higher fees to licensors
for desirable motion picture, television, sports and character properties and
pay more to third-party software developers than we can.  We believe that the main competitive factors
in the interactive entertainment software industry include: product features
and playability; brand name recognition; compatibility of products with popular
platforms; access to distribution channels; quality of products; ease of use;
price; marketing support; and quality of customer service.


We compete primarily with other publishers of personal computer and
video game console interactive entertainment software.  Significant third-party software competitors
currently include, among others: Atari, Inc.; Capcom Co. Ltd.; Eidos PLC;
Electronic Arts Inc.; Konami Company Ltd.; Namco Ltd.; Sega Enterprises, Ltd.;
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.; THQ Inc.; Ubi Soft Entertainment; and
Vivendi Universal Publishing.  In
addition, integrated video game console hardware and software companies such as
Sony Computer Entertainment, Nintendo Co. Ltd. and Microsoft Corporation compete
directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective
platforms.

We also compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure
activities.  For example, we believe that
the overall growth in the use of the Internet and online services by consumers
may pose a competitive threat if customers and potential customers spend less
of their available time using interactive entertainment software and more using
the Internet and online services.

We may face difficulty obtaining access to retail shelf
space necessary to market and sell our products effectively.

Retailers of our products typically have a limited amount of shelf
space and promotional resources, and there is intense competition among
consumer interactive entertainment software products for high quality retail
shelf space and promotional support from retailers.  To the extent that the number of products and
platforms increases, competition for shelf space may intensify and may require us
to increase our marketing expenditures. 
Retailers with limited shelf space typically devote the most and highest
quality shelf space to those products expected to be best sellers.  We cannot be certain that our new products
will consistently achieve such “best seller” status.  Due to increased competition for limited
shelf space, retailers and distributors are in an increasingly better position
to negotiate favorable terms of sale, including price discounts, price
protection, marketing and display fees and product return policies.  Our products constitute a relatively small
percentage of any retailer’s sales volume. 
We cannot be certain that retailers will continue to purchase our
products or to provide our products with adequate levels of shelf space and
promotional support on acceptable terms. 
A prolonged failure in this regard may significantly harm our business
and financial results.

Our sales may decline substantially without warning and in a
brief period of time because we do not have long-term contracts for the sale of
our products.

In the United States and Canada, we primarily sell our products on a
direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount
warehouses and game specialty stores. 
Our products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through
third-party distribution and licensing arrangements and through our
wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries.  Our sales are made primarily on a purchase
order basis without long-term agreements or other forms of commitments.  Our largest customer, Wal-Mart, accounted for
approximately 23% and 20% of our consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2005 and
2004, respectively.  The loss of, or
significant reduction in sales to, any of our principal retail customers or
distributors could significantly harm our business and financial results.

We may permit our customers to return our products and to
receive pricing concessions which could reduce our net revenues and results of
operations.

We are exposed to the risk of product returns and price protection with
respect to our distributors and retailers. Return policies allow distributors
and retailers to return defective, shelf-worn and damaged products in
accordance with terms granted. Price protection, when granted and applicable,
allows customers a credit against amounts they owe us with respect to
merchandise unsold by them. We may permit product returns from, or grant price
protection to, our customers under certain conditions.  The conditions our customers must meet to be
granted the right to return products or price protection are, among other
things, compliance with applicable payment terms, delivery to us of weekly
inventory and sell-through reports, and consistent participation in the
launches of our premium title releases. 
We may also consider other factors, including the facilitation of
slow-moving inventory and other market factors.   When we offer price protection, we offer it
with respect to a particular product to all of our retail customers; however,
only those customers who meet the conditions detailed above can avail
themselves of such price protection.  We
also offer a 90-day limited warranty to our end users that our products will be
free from manufacturing defects. Although we maintain a reserve for returns and
price protection, and although we may place limits on product returns and price
protection, we could be forced to accept substantial product returns and
provide substantial price protection to maintain our relationships with
retailers and our access to distribution channels. Product returns and price
protection that exceed our reserves could significantly harm our business and
financial results.


We may be burdened with payment defaults and uncollectible
accounts if our distributors or retailers cannot honor their credit arrangement
with us.

Distributors and retailers in the interactive entertainment software
industry have from time to time experienced significant fluctuations in their
businesses, and a number of them have failed. 
The insolvency or business failure of any significant retailer or
distributor of our products could materially harm our business and financial
results.  We typically make sales to most
of our retailers and some distributors on unsecured credit, with terms that
vary depending upon the customer’s credit history, solvency, credit limits and
sales history, as well as whether we can obtain sufficient credit
insurance.  Although, as in the case with
most of our customers, we have insolvency risk insurance to protect against our
customers’ bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation, this insurance contains a
significant deductible and a co-payment obligation, and the policy does not
cover all instances of non-payment.  In
addition, although we maintain a reserve for uncollectible receivables, the
reserve may not be sufficient in every circumstance.  As a result, a payment default by a
significant customer could significantly harm our business and financial
results.

We may not be able to maintain our distribution relationships
with key vendors.

Our CD Contact, NBG and Centresoft subsidiaries distribute interactive
entertainment software and hardware products and provide related services in
the Benelux countries, Germany and the United Kingdom, respectively, and via
export in other European countries for a variety of entertainment software
publishers, many of which are our competitors, and hardware manufacturers.  These services are generally performed under
limited term contracts.  Although we
expect to use reasonable efforts to retain these vendors, we may not be
successful in this regard.  The
cancellation or non-renewal of one or more of these contracts could
significantly harm our business and financial results.  Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft products
accounted for approximately 18%, 4% and 3%, respectively, of our worldwide
distribution net revenues for fiscal 2005.

Our international revenues may be
subject to regulatory requirements as well as currency fluctuations.

Our international revenues have accounted for a significant portion of
our total revenues.  International sales
and licensing accounted for 50%, 53% and 50% of our consolidated net revenues
in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 
We expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant
portion of our total revenues in the future. 
International sales may be subject to unexpected regulatory
requirements, tariffs and other barriers. 
Additionally, foreign sales that are made in local currencies may
fluctuate. We have and may continue to engage in limited currency hedging
activities.  Currency exchange rates
fluctuations may in the future have a material negative impact on revenues from
international sales and licensing and thus our business and financial results.

Our business, our products and our
distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories of
content, consumer piracy and online delivery. 
If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our business may
suffer.

Legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the
content of our products and their distribution. 
For example, privacy laws in the United States and Europe impose various
restrictions on our web sites.  Those rules vary
by territory although the Internet recognizes no geographical boundaries.  In addition, many foreign countries have laws
that permit governmental entities to censor the content and advertising of
interactive entertainment software. 
Other countries, such as Germany, have adopted laws regulating content
both in packaged goods and those transmitted over the Internet that are
stricter than current United States laws.

In the United States, federal and several state governments are
considering content restrictions on products such as ours, as well as
restrictions on distribution of such products. 
We may be required to modify our products or alter our marketing
strategies to comply with new regulations, which could delay the release of our
products in those countries.  Due to the
uncertainties regarding such regulations, confusion in the marketplace may
occur, and we are unable to predict what effect, if any, such regulations would
have on our business.  In addition, a
number of state legislative bodies in states such as Illinois, California, New
York and Washington introduced various forms of legislation designed to
regulate and control sales of video games deemed inappropriate for sales to
minors. While we believe that such legislation is in violation of the First
Amendment prohibition on restraints on free speech and therefore
unconstitutional and will continue to support the efforts of our industry in
opposing the introduction and adoption of such laws, in the event such
legislation is adopted and enforced, the sales of our products in states with
such laws may be negatively affected.

In addition to such regulations, certain retailers have in the past
declined to stock some of our products because they believed that the content
of the packaging artwork or the products would be offensive to the retailer’s


customer base.  Although to date these actions have not
caused material harm to our business, we cannot assure you that similar actions
by our distributors or retailers in the future would not cause material harm to
our business.

Our products may be subject to legal claims.

In prior fiscal years, two lawsuits,

Linda
Sanders, et al. v. Meow Media, Inc., et al.

, United States
District Court for the District of Colorado, and

Joe James,
et al. v. Meow Media, Inc., et al.

, United States District
Court for the Western District of Kentucky, Paducah Division, have been filed
against numerous video game companies, including us, by the families of victims
who were shot and killed by teenage gunmen in attacks perpetrated at
schools.  These lawsuits alleged that the
video game companies manufactured and/or supplied these teenagers with violent
video games, teaching them how to use a gun and causing them to act out in a
violent manner.  These lawsuits have been
dismissed.  Similar additional lawsuits
may be filed in the future.  Although our
general liability insurance carrier agreed to defend us in such lawsuits in the
past, it is uncertain whether the insurance carrier would do so in the future,
or if it would cover all or any amounts which we might be liable for if such
future lawsuits are not decided in our favor. 
If such future lawsuits are filed and ultimately decided against us and
our insurance carrier does not cover the amounts we are liable for, it could
have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.  Payment of significant claims by insurance
carriers may make such insurance coverage materially more expensive or
unavailable in the future, thereby exposing our business to additional risk.

We may face limitations on our ability to find suitable
acquisition opportunities or to integrate additional acquired businesses.

We intend to pursue additional acquisitions of companies, properties
and other assets that can be purchased or licensed on acceptable terms and
which we believe can be operated or exploited profitably.  Some of these transactions could be material
in size and scope.  Although we continue
to search for additional acquisition opportunities, we may not be successful in
identifying suitable acquisitions.  As
the interactive entertainment software industry continues to consolidate, we
face significant competition in seeking and consummating acquisition
opportunities.  We may not be able to
consummate potential acquisitions or an acquisition may not enhance our
business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings.  In the future, we may issue additional shares
of our common stock in connection with one or more acquisitions, which may
dilute our existing shareholders.  Future
acquisitions could also divert substantial management time and result in
short-term reductions in earnings or special transaction or other charges.  In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will
be able to successfully integrate the businesses that we may acquire into our
existing business.  Our shareholders may
not have the opportunity to review, vote on or evaluate future acquisitions.

Our shareholder rights plan, charter documents and other
agreements may make it more difficult to acquire us without the approval of our
Board of Directors.

We have adopted a shareholder rights plan
under which one right entitling the holder to purchase two nine-hundredths
(2/900) of a share, as adjusted on account of stock dividends made since the
plan’s adoption, of our Series A Junior Preferred Stock price at an
exercise price of $8.89 per share, subject to adjustment and as adjusted on
account of stock dividends made since the plan’s adoption, is attached to each
outstanding share of common stock.  Such
shareholder rights plan makes an acquisition of control in a transaction not
approved by our Board of Directors more difficult.  Our Amended and Restated By-laws have advance
notice provisions for nominations for election of nominees to the Board of
Directors which may make it more difficult to acquire control of us.  Our long-term incentive plans provide, in the
discretion of a committee, for acceleration of stock options following a change
in control under certain circumstances, which has the effect of making an
acquisition of control more expensive. 
In addition, some of our officers have severance compensation agreements
that provide for substantial cash payments and accelerations of other benefits
in the event of a change in control. 
These agreements and arrangements may also inhibit a change in control.


Our reported financial results could be
affected if significant changes in current accounting principles are adopted.

Recent actions and public comments from the
Securities and Exchange Commission have focused on the integrity of financial
reporting generally. Similarly, Congress has considered a variety of bills that
could affect certain accounting principles. The Financial Accounting Standards
Board, Public Company Accounting and Oversight Board and other regulatory
accounting agencies have recently adopted several new accounting standards,
such as accounting for stock options, some of which represent a significant
change from current practices. Changes in our accounting for stock options
could materially increase our reported expenses.

Our stock price is highly
volatile.

The trading price of our common stock has been and could continue to be
subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, including:

•

Quarter
to quarter variations in results of operations;

•

Our
announcements of new products;

•

Our
competitors’ announcements of new products;

•

Our
product development or release schedule;

•

General
conditions in the computer, software, entertainment, media or electronics
industries and in the economy;

•

Timing
of the introduction of new platforms and delays in the actual release of new
platforms;

•

Hardware
manufacturers’ announcements of price reductions in hardware platforms;

•

Changes
in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts; and

•

Investor
perceptions and expectations regarding our products, plans and strategic
position and those of our competitors and customers.

In addition, the public stock markets experience extreme price and trading
volume volatility, particularly in high technology sectors of the market.  This volatility has significantly affected
the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons often
unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies.  These broad market fluctuations may adversely
affect the market price of our common stock.

We seek to manage
our business with a view to achieving long-term results, and this could have a
negative effect on short-term trading.

We focus on
creation of shareholder value over time, and we intend to make decisions that
will be consistent with this long-term view. 
As a result, some of our decisions, such as whether to make or
discontinue operating investments, manage our balance sheet and capital structure,
or pursue or discontinue strategic initiatives, may be in conflict with the
objectives of short-term traders. 
Further, this could adversely affect our quarterly or other short-term
results of operations.

We do not pay cash dividends on our common stock.

We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock nor do we
anticipate paying cash dividends in the near future.

Item 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On March 5, 2004, a class action lawsuit was filed against us and
certain of our current and former officers and directors.  The complaint, which asserts claims under
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based
on allegations that our revenues and assets were overstated during the period
between February 1, 2001 and December 17, 2002, was filed in the
United States District Court, Central District of California by the
Construction Industry and Carpenters Joint Pension Trust for Southern Nevada
purporting to represent a class of purchasers of Activision stock.  Five additional purported class actions have
subsequently been filed by Gianni Angeloni, Christopher Hinton, Stephen Anish,
the Alaska Electrical Pension Fund and Joseph A. Romans asserting the same
claims.  Consistent with the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”), the court appointed lead plaintiffs
consolidating the six putative securities class actions into a single
case.  In an Order dated May 16,
2005, the court dismissed the consolidated complaint because the plaintiffs
failed to satisfy the heightened pleading standards of the PSLRA.  The court did, however, give the lead
plaintiffs leave to file an amended consolidated complaint within 30 days of
the order.  We do not know whether the
lead plaintiffs will file an amended consolidated complaint, but in the event
that one is filed, we intend to vigorously defend the case at such time.


In
addition, on March 12, 2004, a shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned

Frank Capovilla, Derivatively on Behalf of Activision, Inc. v.
Robert Kotick, et al.

was filed, purportedly on behalf of
Activision, which in large measure asserts the identical claims set forth in
the federal class action lawsuit.  That complaint was filed in California
Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles. Also, on March 22, 2005, a
new derivative lawsuit captioned

Ramalingham Balamohan,
Derivatively on Behalf of Nominal Defendant Activision, Inc. v. Robert
Kotick, et al.

was filed in the Federal Court of Los Angeles. 
This complaint makes the same allegations as the previous complaints, but it
names all the current directors as defendants.  We strongly deny
allegations in both derivative cases and will vigorously defend these
cases.  In the California derivative case, Activision, as nominal
defendant, filed a motion to stay all proceedings.  The case, and all
motion practice and responsive pleadings, has been held in abeyance pending a
status conference with the court. In the Federal derivative case, plaintiff
filed a notice of dismissal of the action, without prejudice on or about June 3,
2005.

On July 11, 2003, we were informed by
the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that the Securities and
Exchange Commission has commenced a non-public formal investigation captioned “In
the Matter of Certain Video Game Manufacturers and Distributors.” The
investigation appears to be focused on certain accounting practices common to the
interactive entertainment industry, with specific emphasis on revenue
recognition.  In connection with this
inquiry, the Securities and Exchange Commission submitted to us a request for
information.  We responded to this
inquiry on September 2, 2003.  To
date, we have not received a request from the Securities and Exchange
Commission for any additional information. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission staff also informed us that other
companies in the video game industry received similar requests for information.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has advised us that this request for
information should not be construed as an indication from the Securities and
Exchange Commission or its staff that any violation of the law has occurred,
nor should it reflect negatively on any person, entity or security. We have
cooperated and intend to continue to cooperate fully with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in the conduct of this inquiry.

On June 30, 2003, we terminated our Star
Trek Merchandising License Agreement with Viacom Consumer Products, Inc.
and filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California for
breach of contract and constructive trust against Viacom Consumer Products and
Viacom International, Inc. (“Viacom”). On August 15, 2003, Viacom
filed its response to our complaint as well as a cross-complaint alleging,
among other matters, a breach of contract by Activision and seeking claimed
damages in excess of $50 million.

On February 23, 2005, we reached an agreement with Viacom that
settled the legal disputes.  As a result
of the settlement, all pending lawsuits filed by each party in the Superior
Court in Los Angeles regarding this matter have been dismissed by court order
dated March 18, 2005.   The
settlement had no material impact on the financial results of Activision’s
operations.

In addition, w

e
are party to other routine claims and suits brought by us and against us in the
ordinary course of business, including disputes arising over the ownership of
intellectual property rights, contractual claims and collection matters.  In the opinion of management, after
consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such routine claims will not
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

Item 4.

SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY

Item 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY
AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol “ATVI.”

The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low
reported sale prices for our common stock. 
As of May 31, 2005, there were approximately 2,808 holders of
record of our common stock.

On May 31, 2005, the last reported sales price of our common stock
was $15.80.

Cash Dividends

We paid no cash dividends in our fiscal years 2005 or 2004 nor do we
anticipate paying any cash dividends at any time in the foreseeable
future.  We expect that earnings will be
retained for the continued growth and development of the business.  Future dividends, if any, will depend upon our
earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other
factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.

Stock Splits

In April 2003, the Board of Directors
approved a three-for-two split of our outstanding common shares effected in the
form of a 50% stock dividend.  The split
was paid on June 6, 2003 to shareholders of record as of May 16,
2003.  In February 2004, the Board
of Directors approved a second three-for-two split of our outstanding common
shares effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend.  The split was paid on March 15, 2004 to
shareholders of record as of February 23, 2004.   In February 2005, the Board of
Directors approved a four-for-three split of our outstanding common shares
effected in the form of a 33-1/3% stock dividend.  The split was paid on March 22, 2005 to
shareholders of record as of March 7, 2005.  The par value of our common stock was
maintained at the pre-split amount of $.000001.   All share and per share data have been
restated as if the stock splits had occurred as of the earliest period
presented.

On March 7, 2005, in connection with our
stock split, all shares of common stock held as treasury stock were formally
cancelled and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common
Stock.

Buyback Program

During fiscal 2003, our
Board of Directors authorized a buyback program under which we can repurchase
up to $350.0 million of our common stock. Under the program, shares may be
purchased as determined by management, from time to time and within certain
guidelines, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions,
including privately negotiated structured stock repurchase transactions and
through transactions in the options markets. Depending on market conditions and
other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or
from time to time without prior notice.

Under the buyback
program, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the year ended
March 31, 2005.  We repurchased
approximately 2.5 million shares of our common stock for $12.4 million and 21.6
million


shares of our common
stock for $101.4 million, in the years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.  In addition, approximately
2.3 million shares of common stock were acquired in the year ended March 31,
2004 as a result of the settlement of $10.0 million of structured stock
repurchase transactions entered into in fiscal 2003.  As of March 31, 2005, we had no
outstanding structured stock repurchase transactions.  Structured stock repurchase transactions are
settled in cash or stock based on the market price of our common stock on the
date of the settlement. Upon settlement, we either have our capital investment
returned with a premium or receive shares of our common stock, depending,
respectively, on whether the market price of our common stock is above or below
a pre-determined price agreed in connection with each such transaction.

Shareholders’
Rights Plan

On April 18, 2000, our Board of Directors approved a shareholders
rights plan (the “Rights Plan”).  Under
the Rights Plan, each common shareholder at the close of business on April 19,
2000 received a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held.  Each right represents the right to purchase
two nine-hundredths (2/900) of a share, as adjusted on account of stock
dividends made since the plan’s adoption, of our Series A Junior Preferred
Stock at an exercise price of $8.89, as adjusted on account of stock dividends
made since the plan’s adoption. 
Initially, the rights are represented by our common stock certificates
and are neither exercisable nor traded separately from our common stock.  The rights will only become exercisable if a
person or group acquires 15% or more of the common stock of Activision, or
announces or commences a tender or exchange offer which would result in the
bidder’s beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock.

In the event that any person or group acquires 15% or more of our
outstanding common stock, each holder of a right (other than such person or
members of such group) will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise
of such right, in lieu of shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock, the
number of shares of common stock of Activision having a value equal to two
times the then current exercise price of the right.  If we are acquired in a merger or other
business combination transaction after a person has acquired 15% or more of our
common stock, each holder of a right will thereafter have the right to receive
upon exercise of such right a number of the acquiring company’s common shares
having a market value equal to two times the then current exercise price of the
right.  For persons who, as of the close
of business on April 18, 2000, beneficially own 15% or more of the common
stock of Activision, the Rights Plan “grandfathers” their current level of
ownership, so long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of
certain limitations.

We may redeem the rights for $.01 per right at any time until the first
public announcement of the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 15% of our
common stock.  At any time after a person
has acquired 15% or more (but before any person has acquired more than 50%) of
our common stock, we may exchange all or part of the rights for shares of
common stock at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock per right.  The rights expire on April 18, 2010.


Securities Authorized for Issuance Under
Equity Compensation Plans

Information for our equity compensation plans in effect as of March 31,
2005 is as follows (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):

See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included

intangible assets.  Under SFAS No. 142,
goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and should not be
amortized but rather tested at least annually for impairment.  In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we have
not amortized goodwill during the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004, 2003
and 2002.

MANAGE

MENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Our Business

We are a leading international publisher of interactive entertainment
software products.  We have built a
company with a diverse portfolio of products that spans a wide range of
categories and target markets and that is used on a variety of game hardware
platforms and operating systems.  We have
created, licensed and acquired a group of highly recognizable brands, which we
market to a variety of consumer demographics. Our fiscal 2005 product portfolio
included such best-selling products as

Spider-Man 2:  The Movie (“Spider-Man 2”),
Shrek 2, Tony Hawk’s Underground 2 (“THUG 2”), Call of Duty:  Finest Hour, Shark Tale, DOOM 3

and

X-Men Legends

.

Our products cover diverse game categories including action/adventure,
action sports, racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person action and
strategy.  Our target customer base
ranges from casual players to game enthusiasts, children to adults and
mass-market consumers to “value” buyers. 
We currently offer our products primarily in versions that operate on
the Sony PlayStation 2 (“PS2”), Nintendo GameCube (“GameCube”) and Microsoft
Xbox (“Xbox”) console systems, Nintendo Game Boy Advance (“GBA”), Sony
PlayStation Portable (“PSP”) and Nintendo Dual Screen (“NDS”) hand-held devices
and the personal computer (“PC”).  The
installed base for this current generation of hardware platforms is significant
and growing and the fiscal 2005 release of two new handheld devices, NDS, which
was released worldwide, and PSP, which was released in North America, will also
help expand the software market.  We
successfully executed our strategy of having a high-quality product presence at
the launch of the NDS and PSP with one title based on the Spider-Man franchise
at the launch of the NDS and two titles based on the Spider-Man and Tony Hawk
franchises for the launch of the PSP.  We
are currently developing additional titles for the PSP and the NDS while
continuing to develop games for the GBA given its large and growing base.

We also intend
to develop titles for the next-generation console systems which are being
developed by Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft. 
Microsoft recently unveiled their next-generation console, the Xbox 360,
which is expected to be released in November 2005.  We are currently developing four titles for
release on the Xbox 360,

Tony Hawk’s
American Wasteland, Call of Duty 2, Quake IV

and

GUN.

Sony and Nintendo recently unveiled their next-generation consoles, the
PlayStation 3 and Revolution, respectively, and both are expected to be
released in calendar 2006.  Though there
are still many unknowns relating to these new platforms, our aim is to have a
significant presence at the launch of each new platform while being careful not
to move away too quickly from the current generation platforms given their
large and still growing installed base.

Our publishing business involves the development, marketing and sale of
products directly, by license or through our affiliate label program with
certain third-party publishers.  In the
United States and Canada, we primarily sell our products on a direct basis to
mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses and
game specialty stores.  We conduct our
international publishing activities through offices in the United Kingdom (“UK”),
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, Canada and
Japan.  Our products are sold
internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party distribution
and licensing arrangements and through our wholly-owned European distribution
subsidiaries.  Our distribution business
consists of operations located in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany that
provide logistical and sales services to third-party publishers of interactive
entertainment software, our own publishing operations and manufacturers of
interactive entertainment hardware.

Our profitability is directly
affected by the mix of revenues from our publishing and distribution
businesses. Operating margins realized from our publishing business are
substantially higher than margins realized from our distribution business.  Operating margins in our publishing business
are affected by our ability to release highly successful or “hit” titles.  Though many of these titles have substantial
production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets, once a title recoups
these costs, incremental net revenues directly and positively impact our
operating margin. Operating margins in our distribution business are affected
by the mix of hardware and software sales, with software producing higher
margins than hardware.

Our Focus

With respect to future
game development, we will continue to focus on our “big propositions,” products
that are backed by strong brands and high quality development, for which we
will provide significant marketing support.

Our fiscal 2006 “big
propositions” will include well-established brands, which are backed by
high-profile intellectual property and/or highly anticipated motion picture
releases.  Examples of these brands are
our superheroes


and skateboarding brands.  We have a long-term relationship with Marvel
Enterprises through an exclusive licensing agreement.  This agreement grants us the exclusive rights
to develop and publish video games based on Marvel’s comic book franchises
Spider-Man, X-Men, Fantastic 4 and Iron Man. 
Through our long-term relationship with Marvel Enterprises, we expect
our fiscal 2006 releases to include titles based on Marvel’s Spider-Man,
Fantastic 4 and X-Men.  The video game
release of

Fantastic 4

is
scheduled for June 2005 just prior to the theatrical release of “Fantastic
4.”  We will also be developing and
publishing video games based on New Line Cinema’s upcoming feature film “Iron
Man,” which is expected to be released in calendar 2007.  In addition, through our licensing agreement
with Spider-Man Merchandising, LLP, we will be developing and publishing video
games based on Columbia Pictures/Marvel Enterprises, Inc.’s upcoming feature
film “Spider-Man 3,” which is expected to be released in May 2007.   In addition, we have an exclusive licensing
agreement with professional skateboarder Tony Hawk.  The agreement grants us exclusive rights to develop
and publish video games using Tony Hawk’s name and likeness.  Through fiscal 2005, we have released six
successful titles in the Tony Hawk franchise with cumulative net revenues of
$958.1 million, including the most recent,

THUG

, which was released in the third quarter of fiscal 2005.  We will continue to promote our skateboarding
franchise with the release in fiscal 2006 of

Tony
Hawk’s American Wasteland

.

We also continue to develop a number of original intellectual
properties which are developed and owned by Activision.  For example, in the third quarter of fiscal
2005 we released the highly successful

Call
of Duty: Finest Hour

, on multiple console platforms.  This title was ranked by NPD Funworld (“NPD”)
as one of the top-five best selling games in December 2004 and was the
third game based upon this original property following the

Call of Duty

and

Call of Duty: United Offensive

titles

for the PC.  The highly successful title

True Crime: Streets of L.A.,

released in
the third quarter of fiscal 2004, is another title based upon original
intellectual property.  We expect to
develop a variety of games on multiple platforms based on these two original
properties.  We also expect to establish
our fiscal 2006 release,

GUN,

as
a source of recurring revenues.

We
will also continue to evaluate and exploit emerging brands that we believe have
potential to become successful game franchises. 
For example, we have a multi-year, multi-property, publishing agreement
with DreamWorks LLC that grants us the exclusive rights to publish video games
based on DreamWorks Animation SKG’s theatrical release “Shrek 2,” which was
released in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, “Shark Tale,” which was released
in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, “Madagascar,” which was released in the
first quarter of fiscal 2006, as well as upcoming computer-animated films “Over
the Hedge,” and all of their respective sequels, including “Shrek 3.”

In addition to acquiring or creating high profile
intellectual property, we have also continued our focus on establishing and
maintaining relationships with talented and experienced software development
teams.  We have strengthened our internal
development capabilities through the acquisition of several development
companies with talented and experienced teams including, most recently, the
acquisitions of Vicarious Visions Inc. in January 2005, Toys For Bob, Inc.
in April 2005 and Beenox, Inc. in May 2005.  We have development agreements with other
top-level, third-party developers such as id Software and Lionhead Studios.

We
are utilizing these developer relationships, new intellectual property
acquisitions, new original intellectual property creations and our existing
library of intellectual property to further focus our game development on
product lines that will deliver significant, lasting and recurring revenues and
operating profits.

Critical Accounting Policies

We have identified the policies below as
critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial
results.  The impact and any associated
risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed
throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected
financial results.  For a detailed
discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note
1 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.  The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of
title and risk of loss to our customers. 
Certain products are sold to customers with a street date (the date that
products are made widely available for sale by retailers).  For these products we recognize revenue no
earlier than the street date.  Revenue
from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for
returns and price protection.  With
respect to license agreements that provide customers the right to make multiple
copies in exchange for


guaranteed
amounts, revenue is recognized upon delivery of such copies.  Per copy royalties on sales that exceed the
guarantee are recognized as earned.  In
addition, in order to recognize revenue for both product sales and licensing
transactions, persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection
of the related receivable must be probable. 
Revenue recognition also determines the timing of certain expenses,
including cost of sales — intellectual property licenses and cost of sales —
software royalties and amortization.

Sales incentives or other consideration given
by us to our customers is accounted for in accordance with the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue 01-9, “Accounting
for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the
Vendor’s Products).”  In accordance with
EITF Issue 01-9, sales incentives and other consideration that are considered
adjustments of the selling price of our products, such as rebates and product
placement fees, are reflected as reductions of revenue.  Sales incentives and other consideration that
represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received, such as the
appearance of our products in a customer’s national circular ad, are reflected
as sales and marketing expenses.

Allowances for Returns, Price
Protection, Doubtful Accounts and Inventory Obsolescence.

In determining the appropriate unit shipments to our customers, we
benchmark our titles using historical and industry data.  We
closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles,
the performance of products released by other publishers and the anticipated
timing of other releases in order to assess future demands of current and
upcoming titles.  Initial volumes
shipped upon title launch and subsequent reorders are evaluated to ensure that
quantities are sufficient to meet the demands from the retail markets but at
the same time, are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel.

We may permit product returns from, or grant price
protection to, our customers under certain conditions.  In general, price protection refers to the
circumstances when we elect to decrease the wholesale price of a product by a
certain amount and, when granted and applicable, allows customers a credit
against amounts owed by such customers to Activision with respect to open
and/or future invoices.  The conditions
our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or price
protection are, among other things, compliance with applicable payment terms,
delivery to us of weekly inventory and sell-through reports, and consistent
participation in the launches of our premium title releases.  We may also consider other factors, including
the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market factors.  Management must make estimates of potential
future product returns and price protection related to current period product
revenue.  We estimate the amount of
future returns and price protection for current period product revenue
utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and
the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer.  The following factors are used to estimate
the amount of future returns and price protection for a particular title:  historical performance of titles in similar
genres, historical performance of the hardware platform, historical performance
of the brand, console hardware life cycle, Activision sales force and retail
customer feedback, industry pricing, weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory,
absolute quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory, Activision warehouse
on-hand inventory levels, the title’s recent sell-through history (if
available), marketing trade programs and competing titles.  The relative importance of these factors
varies among titles depending upon, among other items, genre, platform,
seasonality and sales strategy. 
Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in
connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in
any accounting period.  Based upon
historical experience we believe our estimates are reasonable.  However, actual returns and price protection
could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a number of reasons
including, among others, a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release
in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor, or
technological obsolescence due to the emergence of new hardware platforms.  Material differences may result in the amount
and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments
or utilizes different estimates in determining the allowances for returns and
price protection.

Similarly, management must make estimates of the
uncollectibility of our accounts receivable. 
In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze the age of
current outstanding account balances, historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes
in our customers’ payment terms and their economic condition, as well as
whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance.  Any significant changes in any of these
criteria would impact management’s estimates in establishing our allowance for
doubtful accounts.

We value inventory at the lower of cost or
market.  We regularly review inventory
quantities on hand and in the retail channel and record a provision for excess
or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products.
Significant changes in demand for our products would impact management’s
estimates in establishing our inventory provision.


Software Development Costs.

Software development costs include payments made to independent software
developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for
internally developed products.

We account for software development costs in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 86,
“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed.”  Software development costs
are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and
such costs are determined to be recoverable. 
Technological feasibility of a product encompasses both technical design
documentation and game design documentation. 
For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the
development cycle.  Technological
feasibility is evaluated on a product-by-product basis.  Prior to a product’s release, we expense, as
part of cost of sales — software royalties and amortization, capitalized costs
when we believe such amounts are not recoverable.  Capitalized costs for those products that are
cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period
of cancellation.  Amounts related to
software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to
product development expense.  We evaluate
the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.  The
recoverability of capitalized software development costs is evaluated based on
the expected performance of the specific products for which the costs
relate.  Criteria used to evaluate
expected product performance include: 
historical performance of comparable products using comparable
technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and estimated
performance of a sequel product based on the performance of the product on
which the sequel is based.

Commencing upon product release, capitalized software
development costs are amortized to cost of sales — software royalties and
amortization based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected
revenues, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months or
less.  For products that have been
released in prior periods, we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized
amounts on a quarterly basis.  The
primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance.

Significant management judgments and estimates are
utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established, as
well as in the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of capitalized
costs.  In evaluating the recoverability
of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes
forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred.  If revised forecasted or actual product sales
are less than and/or revised forecasted or actual costs are greater than the
original forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis,
the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given
quarter, which could result in an impairment charge.

Intellectual Property Licenses.

Intellectual property license costs represent license fees paid to
intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks, copyrights,
software, technology or other intellectual property or proprietary rights in
the development of our products. 
Depending upon the agreement with the rights holder, we may obtain the
rights to use acquired intellectual property in multiple products over multiple
years, or alternatively, for a single product.

We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized
intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis.  The recoverability of capitalized
intellectual property license costs is evaluated based on the expected performance
of the specific products in which the licensed trademark or copyright is to be
used.  As many of our intellectual
property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple years, we also
assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs
based on certain qualitative factors such as the success of other products
and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property, whether
there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series based on
the intellectual property and the rights holder’s continued promotion and
exploitation of the intellectual property. 
Prior to the related product’s release, we expense, as part of cost of
sales — intellectual property licenses, capitalized intellectual property costs
when we believe such amounts are not recoverable.  Capitalized intellectual property costs for
those products that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product
development expense in the period of cancellation.  Criteria used to evaluate expected product
performance include: historical performance of comparable products using
comparable technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and
estimated performance of a sequel product based on the performance of the
product on which the sequel is based.

Commencing upon the related product’s release,
capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost of sales
— intellectual property licenses based on the ratio of current revenues for the
specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the
licensed property will be utilized.  As
intellectual property license contracts may extend for multiple years, the
amortization of capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to
such contracts may extend beyond one year. 
For intellectual property included in products that have been released


and
unreleased products, we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized
amounts on a quarterly basis.  The
primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance.

Significant management
judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of
capitalized costs.

In evaluating the recoverability of
capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes
forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred.  If revised forecasted or actual product sales
are less than, and/or revised forecasted or actual costs are greater than, the
original forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis,
the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given
quarter, which could result in an impairment charge.  Additionally, as noted above, as many of our
intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple
years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property
license costs based on certain qualitative factors such as the success of other
products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property,
whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series
based on the intellectual property and the rights holder’s continued promotion
and exploitation of the intellectual property. 
Material differences may result in the amount and timing of charges for
any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates
in evaluating these qualitative factors.


Selected Consolidated Statements of
Operations Data

The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of
operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of consolidated net
revenues and also breaks down net revenues by territory and platform, as well
as operating income by business segment:


Results of Operations – Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2005 and 2004

Net income for the year ended March 31, 2005 was $138.3 million or
$0.66 per diluted share, as compared to $77.7 million or $0.40 per diluted
share for the year ended March 31, 2004.

Net Revenues

We primarily derive revenue
from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on video
game consoles (such as the PS2, Xbox and GameCube), PCs and hand-held game
devices (such as the GBA, NDS and PSP). 
We also derive revenue from our distribution business in Europe that
provides logistical and sales services to third-party publishers of interactive
entertainment software, our own publishing operations and third-party
manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

The following table details our consolidated net revenues by business
segment and our publishing net revenues by territory for the years ended March 31,
2005 and 2004 (in thousands):

Consolidated net revenues increased 48% from $947.7 million for the
year ended March 31, 2004 to $1,405.9 million for the year ended March 31,
2005.  This increase was principally
generated by our publishing business. 
The increase in consolidated net revenues was driven by the following:

•

Strong performances from our publishing
business on the releases of our largest ever lineup of titles including:

Spider-Man 2, Call of Duty: Finest Hour, THUG 2,
Shrek 2, X-Men Legends, Doom 3, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate
Events, Shark Tale, Cabela’s Big Game Hunter 2005

and

Rome: Total War.

The strength of these titles combined with the
significant sales and marketing investment led to over ten million-unit selling
titles and achievement of our goal of having four multi-million-unit selling
titles.  We also had strong catalog sales from a number of our franchises
including Tony Hawk, True Crime, Spider-Man and Call of Duty.  As a result of the strong performance of our
key fiscal 2005 releases, we were able to maintain the original price points
for those titles for an extended period of time.

•

Continued focus on
international publishing expansion with the opening of offices in Spain and
Italy and an increased focus on other territories contributing to an increase
in International Publishing revenues of 72% over fiscal 2004.

•

An increase in
our hand-held platform presence growing consolidated hand-held revenues

by $118.7 million or 274% from
$43.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2004 to $162.0 million for the
year ended March 31, 2005.  This was
driven by a significant increase in the number of GBA titles released from four
titles in fiscal 2004 to eleven titles in fiscal 2005, and by the introduction
of the PSP and NDS platforms, for which we released a combined total of three
titles.

•

International
net revenues benefited from the strong year-over-year strengthening of the Euro
(“EUR”) and Great British Pound (“GBP”) in relation to the U.S. dollar.  We estimate that foreign exchange rates
increased reported net revenues by approximately $55.3 million.   Excluding the impact of changing foreign
currency rates, our international net revenues increased 31% year-over-year.

In
addition, we had strong catalog sales from a number of our franchises,

the EUR and the GBP in relation to the U.S. dollar of approximately $29.0
million.  Excluding the impact of

increased 59% year-over-year.  In the

capabilities.  In fiscal 2006, we expect
to increase our direct-selling efforts in five countries and materially expand
our international marketing efforts.

combined
with continued strong sell through of our catalog title,

Call of Duty.

According to NPD, we were the only publisher
to have three top-ten PC titles for calendar year 2004 —

Doom 3, Call of Duty

and

Rome: Total War.

Also
contributing to the increase in net revenues from sales of titles for the PC
was an increase in the total number of titles shipped from eight in fiscal 2004
to fifteen in fiscal 2005.   We expect
fiscal 2006 PC publishing net revenues as a percentage of total publishing net
revenues to remain consistent with fiscal 2005.

Net revenues from sales of titles for the PS2
increased 44% from $289.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2004 to
$417.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2005.  The increase was primarily due to strong,
worldwide sales of several of our fiscal 2005 releases including

THUG 2, Call of Duty: Finest
Hour, X-Men Legends, Spider-Man 2, Shrek 2, Shark Tale,

Lemony Snicket’s A Series of
Unfortunate Events

and

Cabela’s Big Game Hunter 2005.

In fiscal
2005 we released thirteen titles for PS2 compared to ten in fiscal 2004 which
included:

True Crime: Streets of L.A., Tony Hawk’s Underground,
X2: Wolverine’s Revenge, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Cabela’s Dangerous Hunts

and

Cabela’s Deer Hunt 2004
Season.

We expect the
installed base of PS2 to continue to grow, although at a slower rate than in
previous years, due to the anticipated release of the next-generation system in
calendar 2006.  Given our slate of fiscal 2006 titles, as the
installed base increases we expect our overall net revenues from PS2 sales to
continue to increase over prior periods. 
In addition, Sony recently announced that they will be releasing their
next-generation console, the PlayStation 3 (“PS3”), in calendar 2006.  Given the initially low installed base, we
expect the release of the PS3 to have little impact on fiscal 2006 net
revenues.

Net revenues from sales of titles for the
Xbox increased 36% from $145.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2004
to $196.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2005.  Though the number of new Xbox titles remained
relatively consistent from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005, we were able to increase
our Xbox sales in both the North America and international markets.  The increase was primarily due to strong
worldwide sales of several of our Xbox titles including

THUG 2, Call of Duty: Finest
Hour, X-Men Legends, Spider-Man 2, Shrek 2, Shark Tale,

Greg Hastings’ Tournament
Paintball

and

Cabela’s Big Game Hunter 2005.

The increase was also affected by an
increased installed base of the Xbox due mainly to the price cuts on the Xbox
hardware in calendar 2004.  Given our slate of fiscal 2006 titles, as the
installed base increases we expect our overall net revenues from Xbox sales to
continue to increase over prior periods. 
We expect the growth of the installed base of Xbox hardware to
continue to grow through the remainder of calendar 2005 with growth slowing as
the release of Microsoft’s next-generation system, the Xbox 360, which is
expected to be released in November 2005. 
Consistent with our strategy of having a high-quality presence at the
launch of each new platform, we are currently developing four titles,

Tony Hawk’s American Wasteland, Call of Duty 2, Quake
IV

and

GUN,

to be
released concurrently with the launch of the Xbox 360.  We expect that the potential release of the
Xbox 360 will not have a material impact on our fiscal 2006 net revenues due to
a number of factors, including an initially small installed base.

Net revenues from sales of titles for the
Nintendo GameCube increased 83% from $52.9 million for the year ended March 31,
2004 to $96.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2005.  The increase is primarily due to the increase
in the number of GameCube new title releases from five in fiscal 2004 to eight
in fiscal 2005.  Also driving the
increase in revenues was that the title slate in fiscal 2005 performed strongly
as it was more targeted toward the demographic of the GameCube audience than
the fiscal 2004 GameCube title slate. 
Our fiscal 2005 title slate was driven by new title releases of

Shrek 2, Spider-Man 2, Shark Tale,

Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events

, THUG 2

and

Call of Duty: Finest Hour.

Fiscal
2004 GameCube revenues were driven mainly by releases of

Tony Hawk’s Underground

and

True Crime: Streets of L.A

.

We
expect the installed base of GameCube hardware to continue to grow given its current
low price point; however, at a slower pace than previous years given the
upcoming next-generation console transition.  
We also expect fiscal 2006 GameCube net revenues to increase over fiscal
2005 given our planned 2006 product slate. 
Nintendo recently announced

that
they will be releasing their next-generation console, the Revolution, in
calendar 2006.  Given the initially low
installed base, we expect the release of the Revolution to have little initial
impact on our net revenues.

Net revenues from sales of titles for the hand-held
for the year ended March 31, 2005 increased 456% from the prior fiscal
year, from $24.9 million to $138.7 million. 
This was driven mainly by a significant increase in the number of GBA
titles released from four titles in fiscal 2004 to eleven titles in fiscal 2005
and the introduction of two new handheld devices, NDS, which was released
worldwide, and PSP, which was released in North America.   We successfully executed our strategy of
having a high-quality presence at the launch of both the NDS and PSP platforms
with one title based on the Spider-Man franchise at the launch of the NDS and
two titles based on the Spider-Man and Tony Hawk franchises for the launch of
the PSP.  In addition to the increase in
the number of GBA titles released,

we implemented a customized marketing plan for the GBA platform and
demographic to support a strong slate of new releases including

THUG 2, Shrek 2: Beg for Mercy!, Shark Tale

,

Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events

, Spider-Man 2

and

Shrek 2

which were all targeted toward the demographic of the GBA audience.

We expect the overall hand-held market to grow significantly with the
recent releases of the NDS and PSP. 
However, with the releases of the NDS and PSP we expect that market
share for the GBA will eventually begin to decrease while the overall hand-held
market will continue to expand with a growing installed base and broader
demographic on the newer platforms.  We
expect to continue our focus on developing hand-held games for mass-market
consumers for each of these hand-held platforms.   Due to the expected increase in the overall
hand-held market and our fiscal 2006 product slate, we expect net revenues from
sales of titles for the hand-held to increase over fiscal 2005.


Overall

The platform mix of our future publishing net
revenues will likely be impacted by a number of factors, including the ability
of hardware manufacturers to continue to increase their installed hardware
base, the introduction of new hardware platforms, as well as the timing of key
product releases from our product release schedule.  We expect that net revenues from console
titles will continue to represent the largest component of our publishing net
revenues with PS2 having the largest percentage of that business due to its
larger installed hardware base.  We
expect net revenues from hand-held titles to remain the smallest component of
our publishing net revenues.  However,
with the recent releases of the NDS and PSP platforms, we expect to see a
continued increase in our hand-held business in comparison to prior
periods.  Our net revenues from PC titles
will be primarily driven by our product release schedule.

A significant portion of our revenues and
profits is derived from a relatively small number of popular titles and brands
each year as revenues and profits are significantly affected by our ability to
release highly successful or “hit” titles.  
For example, for the year ended March 31, 2005, 31% of our
consolidated net revenues and 41% of worldwide publishing net revenues were
derived from net revenues from our

Spider-Man
2, THUG 2

and

Call of Duty:
Finest Hour

titles.  Though
many titles have substantial production or acquisition costs and marketing
budgets, once a title recoups these costs, incremental net revenues directly
and positively impact operating profits resulting in a disproportionate amount
of operating income being derived from these select titles.   We expect that a limited number of titles
and brands will continue to produce a disproportionately large amount of our
net revenues and profits.

Two factors that could affect future
publishing and distribution net revenue performance are console hardware
pricing and software pricing.  As console
hardware moves through its life cycle, hardware manufacturers typically enact
price reductions.  Reductions in the
price of console hardware typically result in an increase in the installed base
of hardware owned by consumers.

Price cuts on Xbox, PS2 and GBA hardware were
announced in March, May and September 2004, respectively.  Historically, we have also seen that
lower console hardware prices put downward pressure on software pricing.  While we expect console software launch
pricing for most genres to hold at $49.99 through the calendar 2005 holidays,
we believe we could see additional software price declines thereafter.

Distribution net revenues for the year ended March 31,
2005 increased 18% from the prior fiscal year, from $281.9 million to $333.1
million.  Excluding the impact of the
changing foreign currency rates, our distribution net revenues increased 9%
year-over-year.  About half of this
increase was due to the positive impact of the year-over-year strengthening of
the EUR and the GBP in relation to the U.S. dollar.

The increase was primarily due to the continued growth in the industry
wide software market, an increase in sales to mass merchants, as well as a
change in the product mix.  The
mix of distribution net revenues between hardware and software sales varied
year-over-year with approximately 13% of distribution net revenues from
hardware sales in the year ended March 31, 2005 as compared to 28% in the
prior fiscal year.  This was mainly
attributed to an increase in business with large, mass-market customers that
generate a higher percentage of sales from software.  In both fiscal years, hardware sales were
principally comprised of sales of console hardware.  The mix of future distribution net revenues
will be driven by a number of factors including the occurrence of further
hardware price reductions instituted by hardware manufacturers, the
introduction of new hardware platforms and our ability to establish and
maintain distribution agreements with hardware manufacturers and third-party
software publishers.  We expect our
fiscal 2006 distribution results to be in line with fiscal 2005.

Cost of sales – product costs represented 47%

and 2004, respectively.

In absolute dollars, cost of sales — product
costs increased 39% due to significantly higher sales in fiscal 2005 as
compared to fiscal 2004.  The primary
factors affecting the reduction in the cost of sales — product costs as a percentage
of consolidated net revenues were:

•

Increased ability to maintain premium pricing
on “big proposition” titles for the year ended March 31, 2005.

•

An increase in publishing net revenues from
sales of PC titles by 66% year-over-year. 
PC publishing revenues as a percent of publishing net revenues for the
year also grew from 20% to 21%.  PC
titles typically have lower product costs associated with them.

•

A lower percentage of revenues generated from
our distribution business, which is a lower margin business, in fiscal 2005 as
compared to fiscal 2004.

We expect cost of sales — product costs as a
percentage of net revenues to slightly decrease as a percentage of revenue in
fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. 
This is primarily due to a lower percentage of revenue expected to be
generated from our distribution business in fiscal 2006, which is a lower
margin business.  We may also continue to
experience a benefit from changes in product mix in fiscal 2006 due to the
focus on “big proposition” titles, for which we could benefit from higher
retail pricing and manufacturing volume discounts.

Cost of sales – intellectual property

and as a percentage of publishing net revenues over the same period last year,
from 5% to 6%.

The increases in both absolute dollars and as
a percentage of publishing net revenues were due to the release of more titles
with associated licensed intellectual property as well as continued strong
catalog sales of titles with associated licensed intellectual property compared
to the titles released in fiscal 2004 for which a higher proportion of revenues
was derived from titles that were internally developed with no associated
intellectual property.  In fiscal
2005 we released the following titles with associated intellectual property:

Spider-Man 2, Shrek 2, Shark Tale, X-Men Legends,
THUG 2, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events

and

Doom 3.

In
fiscal 2004, two of our top performing titles,

True
Crime: Streets of L.A.

and

Call

were based on our wholly-owned original intellectual
property. In fiscal 2006, we expect cost of sales – intellectual property

Product development expenses for the year

from the prior fiscal year, from 15% to 8%. In absolute dollars, product
development expenses for the year ended March 31, 2005 also decreased from
the prior fiscal year, from $97.9 million to $86.5 million.  The decrease in product development as a
percentage of publishing net revenues and in absolute dollars primarily
resulted from

a
pre-tax charge of approximately $21 million taken in the third quarter of
fiscal 2004 related to the cancellation of products which were believed to be
unlikely to produce an acceptable level of return on our investment.   Excluding the impact of the pre-tax charge,
product development expenses for the year ended March 31, 2005 increased
by approximately $9.7 million.  This
increase was attributable to higher game development costs as development time
and team sizes as well as quality assurance time increased due to enhanced
production values and to support more complex and robust gaming
experiences.  We expect product
development costs to increase in absolute dollars due to next-generation
development costs but stay constant as a percentage of revenues as we leverage
the costs against bigger brands, sold in more markets, across more gaming
devices.

General and administrative expenses of $59.7
million and $44.6 million represented 4% and 5% of consolidated net revenues
for the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  The increase in absolute dollars was
primarily due to

an
increase in headcount and related costs to support business growth, as well as
an increase in professional services fees to support Sarbanes-Oxley related
compliance.  The decrease as a percentage
of consolidated net revenues was due mainly to the significant increase in
sales volume.

Operating Income

(in thousands)

Publishing operating income for the year ended March 31, 2005
increased $67.6 million from the same period last year, from $93.2 million to
$160.8 million.  Excluding the impact of
changes in foreign currency rates, publishing operating income for the year
ended March 31, 2005 increased approximately $56.7 million from the same
period last year. International publishing operating income for the year ended March 31,
2005 benefited from the positive impact of the year-over-year strengthening of
the EUR and the GBP in relation to the U.S. dollar.  The $56.7 million increase is primarily due
to:

•

Strong
performance in both the North America and international markets of our fiscal
2005 title releases.  The strong
performance of the fiscal 2005 releases was driven by our largest lineup ever
of big propositions, a record number of million-unit and multi-million unit
titles and an increased hand-held presence.

Partially offset by:

•

Increased sales
and marketing spending.

•

Increased cost
of sales – product costs, cost of sales – software royalties and amortization,
and cost of sales – intellectual property licenses.

Distribution operating income for the year
ended March 31, 2005 increased over the same period last year, from $16.6
million to $23.7 million.  Excluding the
impact of changes in foreign currency rates, distribution operating income for
the year ended March 31, 2005 increased approximately $5.4 million from
the same period last year. Distribution operating income for the year ended March 31,
2005 benefited from the positive impact of the year-over-year strengthening of
the EUR and the GBP in relation to the U.S. dollar.  The $5.4 million increase was primarily due
to

continued growth
industry wide in the software market combined with a change in the product mix
of hardware versus software sales as software tends to be a higher margin business.

The income tax provision of $59.3 million for
the year ended March 31, 2005 reflects our effective income tax rate of
30%.  The significant items that
generated the variance between our effective rate and our statutory rate of 35%
were research and development tax credits and the impact of foreign tax rate
differentials, partially offset by an increase in our deferred tax asset
valuation allowance and state taxes.  The
realization of deferred tax assets depends primarily on the generation of
future taxable income.  We believe that
it is more likely than not that we will generate taxable income sufficient to
realize the benefit of net deferred tax assets recognized.

Results of Operations – Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2004 and 2003

Net income for the year ended March 31, 2004 was $77.7 million or
$0.40 per diluted share, as compared to $66.2 million or $0.32 per diluted
share for the year ended March 31, 2003.

Net Revenues

The following table details our consolidated net revenues by business
segment and our publishing net revenues by territory for the years ended March 31,
2004 and 2003 (in thousands):

Consolidated net revenues increased 10% from $864.1 million for the
year ended March 31, 2003 to $947.7 million for the year ended March 31,
2004.  This increase was generated by
both our publishing and distribution businesses.  The increase in consolidated net revenues was
driven by the following:


•

Strong
performance of our fiscal 2004 third quarter releases of

True Crime: Streets of L.A.

and

Tony Hawk’s Underground

for the PS2, Xbox
and GameCube

and

Call of Duty

for the PC. We continued to
see strong sales of these titles through March 2004

.

In
addition, we had strong results from several other titles released during
fiscal 2004 including,

Return to Castle
Wolfenstein, X2: Wolverine’s Revenge, Cabela’s Dangerous Hunts, Cabela’s Deer
Hunt 2004 Season,

and in select European markets,

Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy.

We also had strong catalog sales
from a number of our franchises, including Spider-Man.  Catalog sales are sales of titles released
prior to the current fiscal year.

•

Publishing
console net revenues increased by 9% from $466.1 million for the year ended March 31,
2003 to $508.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2004.  As expected, within the mix of specific
consoles, net revenues from the sale of software for the prior generation
console hardware systems, such as PS1, continued to decline while the net
revenues from the sale of software for the current generation of console
hardware systems continued to grow.

•

Net revenues
were positively impacted from titles selling at higher average retail prices
throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003.  As a result of the strong performance of our
key fiscal 2004 releases, we were able to maintain the original price points
for those titles for an extended period of time.

•

International
net revenues benefited from the strong year-over-year strengthening of the Euro
(“EUR”) and Great British Pound (“GBP”) in relation to the U.S. dollar.  We estimate that foreign exchange rates
increased reported net revenues by approximately $52.1 million.   Excluding the impact of changing foreign
currency rates, our international net revenues increased 4% year-over-year.

•

The
increase in publishing net revenues was offset by fewer titles released in
fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003.

Net revenues from sales of titles for the GBA for the year ended March 31,
2004 decreased 44% from the prior fiscal year, from $44.1 million to $24.6
million.  This is due to a decrease in
the number of GBA games released year-over-year.  In fiscal 2003, we released 11 GBA titles,
whereas in fiscal 2004 we released 4 GBA titles.  We expect the hand-held installed base to
grow with the release of the NDS and PSP which are expected to launch in late
calendar year 2004 and early calendar year 2005, respectively.

A significant portion of our revenues and profits are derived from a
relatively small number of popular titles and brands each year as revenues and
profits are significantly affected by our ability to release highly successful
or “hit” titles.   For example, for the
year ended March 31, 2004, 28% of our consolidated net revenues and 40% of
worldwide publishing net revenues were derived from net revenues from our

Tony Hawk’s Underground

and

True Crime: Streets of L.A.

titles.  Though many of these titles have substantial
production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets, once a title recoups
these costs, incremental net revenues directly and positively impact operating
profits resulting in a disproportionate amount of operating income being
derived from these select titles.

Distribution net revenues for the year ended March 31,
2004 increased 14% from the prior fiscal year, from $248.1 million to $281.9
million.  The increase was primarily due
to the positive impact of the year-over-year strengthening of the EUR and the
GBP in relation to the U.S. dollar.  Excluding
the impact of the changing foreign currency rates, our distribution net revenues
was in line with our prior fiscal year, with a slight increase of 2%
year-over-year.  The mix of distribution
net revenues between hardware and software sales varied year-over-year with
approximately 28% hardware in the year ended March 31, 2004 as compared to
38% hardware in the prior fiscal year. 
This is mainly attributed to an increase in business with large,
mass-market customers that generate a higher percentage of sales from software.  In both fiscal years, hardware sales were
principally comprised of sales of console hardware.

Cost of sales – product costs represented 50%

and 2003, respectively.  In absolute
dollars, cost of sales – product costs increased due to higher sales volume in
fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. 
There were two primary factors that affected cost of sales – product
costs as a percentage of consolidated net revenues:

•

The product mix
of our publishing business for the year ended March 31, 2004 reflects a
lower proportion of net revenues from titles for hand-held devices, as compared
to the year ended March 31, 2003. 
Titles for hand-held devices generally have the highest manufacturing
per unit cost of all platforms.

•

Due
to the lower manufacturing costs for PC titles, we were able to benefit from
the strong sales of

Call of Duty

for the year ended March 31, 2004.

royalties and amortization for the year ended March 31, 2004 also
decreased from the prior fiscal year, from $79.2 million to $59.7 million.  The decrease in absolute dollars reflects
that there were approximately fifteen major titles released in fiscal 2004 as

Product development expenses for the year

development expenses for the year ended March 31, 2004 also increased from
the prior fiscal year, from $57.0 million to $97.9 million.  The increase in product development as a
percentage of publishing net revenues and in absolute dollars resulted from:

•

A $21 million
game cancellation charge recorded in the fiscal 2004 third quarter.  We executed a realignment of our product
portfolio driven by the evolution of the video game market, which is
increasingly dominated by high quality products that are based on recognizable
franchises and supported with big marketing programs.  We completed a comprehensive review of our
product portfolio in which we evaluated each product based on a number of
criteria, including:  the strength of the
franchise, the projected product quality, the potential responsiveness of the
product to aggressive marketing support and the financial risk in the event of
product failure.  As a result of this
review, we believed that we had an extensive slate of high-potential properties
in development.  However, we found that
certain projects had a lower likelihood of achieving acceptable levels of
operating performance and that continued pursuit of these projects would create
a substantial opportunity cost as it related to our slate of high-potential
projects. Accordingly, in the three months ended December 31, 2003, we
cancelled the development of ten products that we believed were unlikely to
produce an acceptable level of return on our investment.  In connection with the cancellation of these
products, we recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $21 million.

•

Our increased
emphasis on product quality and the lengthening of product development
schedules.  To maintain the
competitiveness of our products and to take advantage of increasingly
sophisticated technology associated with new hardware platforms, we have
increased the amount of time spent play-testing new products, conducted more
extensive product quality evaluations and lengthened product development
schedules to allow time to make the improvements indicated by our testing and
evaluations.  We are focused on improved
game quality, and in many cases, this has resulted in an increase in product
development costs.

•

The increase in
absolute dollars is also due to an increase in studio employee incentive
compensation as a result of the strong performances of key fiscal 2004 title
releases.

to $44.6 million.  As a percentage of
consolidated net revenues, general and administrative expenses remained
constant at 5%.  The decrease in absolute
dollars was primarily due to:

•

The incurrence
in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 of $1.0 million of merger related expenses
by our publishing business.

•

An approximate

the relocation of our UK distribution facility.

Operating Income

currency rates, publishing operating income for the year ended March 31,

increase is primarily due to:

•

Strong
performance in both the North America and international markets of our fiscal

Partially offset by:

•

Increased sales
and marketing spending.

•

The product
development charge recorded in the fiscal 2004 third quarter in connection with

The income tax provision of $38.3 million for
the year ended March 31, 2004 reflects our effective income tax rate of
33%.  The significant items that
generated the variance between our effective rate and our statutory rate of 35%
were research and development tax credits and the impact of foreign tax rate
differentials, partially offset by an increase in our deferred tax asset
valuation allowance and state taxes.  The
realization of deferred tax assets depends primarily on the generation of
future taxable income.

Selected Quarterly Operating Results

Our quarterly operating results have in the past varied significantly
and will likely vary significantly in the future, depending on numerous
factors, several of which are not under our control.    See Item 1 “Business – Factors Affecting
Future Performance.”  Our business also
has experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant
seasonality, largely due to consumer buying patterns and our product release schedule focusing
on those patterns.  Net revenues
typically are significantly higher during the fourth calendar quarter,
primarily due to the increased demand for consumer software during the year-end
holiday buying season.  Accordingly, we
believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not
necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future
performance.

The following table is a comparative breakdown of our quarterly results
for the immediately preceding eight quarters (amounts in thousands, except per
share data):

Consolidated
financial information has been restated for the effect of our four-for-three
stock split effected in the form of a 33-1/3% stock dividend to shareholders of
record as of March 7, 2005, paid March 22, 2005.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

As of March 31, 2005, our primary source
of liquidity is comprised of $313.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and
$527.3 million of short-term investments. 
Over the last two years, our primary sources of liquidity have included
cash on hand at the beginning of the year and cash flows generated from
continuing operations.  We have also
generated significant cash flows from the issuance of our common stock to
employees through the exercise of options, as well as from the utilization of
structured stock repurchase transactions, which are described in more detail
below in “Cash Flows from Financing Activities.”  We have not utilized debt financing as a
significant source of cash flows. 
However, we do have available at certain of our international locations,
credit facilities, which are described below in “Credit Facilities,” that can
be utilized if needed.

In August 2003, we filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission two amended shelf registration statements,
including the base prospectuses therein. The first shelf registration
statement, on Form S-3, allows us, at any time, to offer any combination
of securities described in the base prospectus in one or more offerings with an
aggregate initial offering price of up to $500,000,000.  Unless we state otherwise in the applicable
prospectus supplement, we expect to use the net proceeds from the sale of the
securities for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures,
working capital, repayment or reduction of long-term and short-term debt and
the financing of acquisitions and other business combinations. We may invest
funds that we do not immediately require in marketable securities.

The second shelf registration statement, on Form S-4,
allows us, at any time, to offer any combination of securities described in the
base prospectus in one or more offerings with an aggregate initial offering
price of up to $250,000,000 in connection with our acquisition of the assets,
business or securities of other companies whether by purchase, merger or any
other form of business combination.

We believe that we have sufficient working
capital ($915.4 million at March 31, 2005), as well as proceeds available
from our international credit facilities, to finance our operational
requirements for at least the next twelve months, including purchases of
inventory and equipment, the funding of the development, production, marketing
and sale of new products and the acquisition of intellectual property rights
for future products from third-parties.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

The primary drivers of cash flows from
operating activities typically have included the collection of customer
receivables generated by the sale of our products, offset by payments to
vendors for the manufacture, distribution and marketing of our products,
third-party developers and intellectual property holders and our own
employees.  A significant operating use
of our cash relates to our continued investment in software development and
intellectual property licenses.  We spent
approximately $126.9 million and $115.2 million in the years ended March 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively, in connection with the acquisition of publishing
or distribution rights for products being developed by


third-parties, the execution of new license agreements granting us
long-term rights to intellectual property of third-parties, as well as the
capitalization of product development costs relating to internally developed
products.  We expect that we will
continue to make significant expenditures relating to our investment in
software development and intellectual property licenses.  Our future cash commitments relating to these
investments are detailed below in “Commitments.”  Cash flows from operations are affected by
our ability to release highly successful or “hit” titles.  Though many of these titles have substantial
production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets, once a title recoups
these costs, incremental net revenues typically will directly and positively
impact cash flows.

For the year
ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, cash flows from operating activities were
$215.3 million and $67.4 million, respectively. 
The principal components comprising cash flows from operating activities
for the year ended March 31, 2005, included favorable operating results
and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by
increases in accounts receivable and our continued investment in software
development and intellectual property licenses. 
See an analysis of the change in key balance sheet accounts below in “Key
Balance Sheet Accounts.”  We expect that
a primary source of future liquidity, both short-term and long-term, will be
the result of cash flows from continuing operations.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

The primary drivers of cash used in investing
activities typically have included capital expenditures, acquisitions of
privately held interactive software development companies and the net effect of
purchases and sales/maturities of short-term investment vehicles.  The goal of our short-term investments is to
maximize return while minimizing risk, maintaining liquidity, coordinating with
anticipated working capital needs and providing for prudent investment
diversification.

For the year ended March 31, 2005 and
2004, cash flows used in investing activities were $143.9 million and $170.2
million, respectively.  For the year
ended March 31, 2005, cash flows used in investing activities were
primarily the result of capital expenditures, cash paid for an acquisition, and
the increase in short-term investments. 
We have historically financed our acquisitions through the issuance of
shares of common stock or a combination of common stock and cash. We will
continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates as to the benefit they
bring to us.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

The primary drivers of cash provided by
financing activities have related to transactions involving our common stock,
including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees and the public,
the purchase of treasury shares, as well as the use of structured stock
repurchase transactions.  We have not
utilized debt financing as a significant source of cash flows.  However, we do have available at certain of
our international locations, credit facilities, which are described below in “Credit
Facilities,” that can be utilized if needed.

For the year ended March 31, 2005 and
2004, cash flows from financing activities were $72.7 million and $117.6
million, respectively.  The cash provided
by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2005 primarily is the
result of the

issuance of common stock related to employee stock option and stock purchase
plans.  During fiscal 2003, our
Board of Directors authorized a buyback program under which we can repurchase
up to $350.0 million of our common stock. Under the program, shares may be
purchased as determined by management and within certain guidelines, from time
to time, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including
privately negotiated structured stock repurchase transactions and through
transactions in the options markets. Depending on market conditions and other
factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time
to time without prior notice.   In the
past, we have entered into structured stock repurchase transactions that were
settled in cash or stock based on the market price of our common stock on the
date of the settlement. Upon settlement, we either had our capital investment
returned with a premium or received shares of our common stock, depending,
respectively, on whether the market price of our common stock was above or
below a pre-determined price agreed in connection with each such
transaction.  As of March 31, 2005,
we had approximately $226.2 million available for utilization under the buyback
program and no outstanding structured stock repurchase transactions.  We actively manage our capital structure as a
component of our overall business strategy. 
Accordingly, in the future, when we determine that market conditions are
appropriate, we may seek to achieve long term value for the shareholders
through, among other things, new debt or equity financings or refinancings,
share repurchases and other transactions involving our equity or debt
securities.


Key Balance Sheet Accounts

Accounts Receivable

The increase in gross accounts
receivable was primarily the result of:

•

Late fourth quarter North American releases
of

THUG 2 Remix

and

Spider-Man 2

for the PSP. 
Both titles were released concurrently with the release of the PSP
platform in late March 2005.

•

The fourth quarter releases of three
affiliate titles,

Mercenaries, Star Wars:
Knights of the Old Republic II

and

Star Wars: Republic Commando

, in our European territories.

•

A continued increase in business of our UK
distribution facility with large, mass-market customers.  Large, mass-market customers typically have
longer trading terms than smaller, independent accounts.

Reserves for returns, price
protection and bad debt increased from $47.0 million at March 31, 2004 to
$69.2 million at March 31, 2005 while reserves as a percentage of gross
receivables declined from 43% to 39%. 
The change in reserves is primarily due to the strong sell through to
end consumers of our key third quarter fiscal 2005 releases.

advances as of March 31, 2004. 
These titles included

Spider-Man 2,
Shrek 2, THUG 2, Call of Duty, Doom 3, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of
Unfortunate Events, Shark Tale

and

Rome:
Total War.

Partially offset by:

•

Continued
investment in software development and intellectual property licenses.  We
spent approximately $126.9 million in the year ended March 31, 2005 in
connection with the acquisition of publishing or distribution rights for
products being developed by third-parties, payments on license agreements
granting us long-term rights to intellectual property of third-parties, as well
as the capitalization of product development costs relating to internally

long-term prospects of the respective product lines.

•

Increased
foreign income taxes payable.

•

Expenses related
to the fourth quarter releases of three affiliate label products in our
European territories.

Credit Facilities

We have revolving credit facilities with our
Centresoft subsidiary located in the UK (the “UK Facility”) and our NBG
subsidiary located in Germany (the “German Facility”).  The UK Facility provided Centresoft with the
ability to borrow up to GBP 8.0 million ($15.0 million), including issuing
letters of credit, on a revolving basis as of March 31, 2005. Furthermore,
under the UK Facility, Centresoft provided a GBP 0.6 million ($1.1 million)
guarantee for the benefit of our CD Contact subsidiary as of March 31,
2005.  The UK Facility bore interest at
LIBOR plus 2.0% as of March 31, 2005, is collateralized by substantially
all of the assets of the subsidiary and expires in January 2006.  The UK Facility also contains various
covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios
related to, among others, fixed charges. 
As of March 31, 2005, we were in compliance with these
covenants.  No borrowings were
outstanding against the UK Facility as of March 31, 2005.  The German Facility provided for revolving
loans up to EUR 0.5 million ($0.6 million) as of March 31, 2005, bore
interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus 2.5%, is collateralized by certain of the
subsidiary’s property and equipment and has no expiration date.  No borrowings were outstanding against the
German Facility as of March 31, 2005.


Commitments

In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual
arrangements with third-parties for non-cancelable operating lease agreements
for our offices, for the development of products, as well as for the rights to
intellectual property.  Under these
agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor, developer or
intellectual property holder, based upon contractual arrangements. Typically,
the payments to third-party developers are conditioned upon the achievement by
the developers of contractually specified development milestones.  These payments to third-party developers and
intellectual property holders typically are deemed to be advances and are
recoupable against future royalties earned by the developer or intellectual
property holder based on the sale of the related game. Additionally, in

connection with certain
intellectual property right acquisitions and development agreements, we will
commit to spend specified amounts for marketing support for the related game(s)
which is to be developed or in which the intellectual property will be
utilized.   Assuming all contractual
provisions are met, the total future minimum commitments for these and other
contractual arrangements in place as of March 31, 2005, are scheduled to
be paid as follows (amounts in thousands):

As of March 31, 2005 and 2004, we did not
have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, such
as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose
entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited
purposes.  As such, we are not exposed to
any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had
engaged in such relationships.

Related Parties

In August 2001, we elected to our Board of Directors
an individual who is a partner in a law firm that has provided legal services
to Activision for more than ten years and who remains a director of the
Company.   For the years ended March 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, the fees we paid to the law firm were an insignificant
portion of the law firm’s total revenues.  
We believe that the fees charged to us by the law firm are competitive
with the fees charged by other law firms.

Financial Disclosure

We maintain internal controls over financial reporting, which generally
include those controls relating to the preparation of our financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. We also are focused on our “disclosure controls and
procedures,” which as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission are
generally those controls and procedures designed to ensure that financial and
non-financial information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission is reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and
that such information is communicated to management, including our Chief
Executive Officers and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our Disclosure Committee, which operates under the board approved
Disclosure Committee Charter and Disclosure Controls & Procedures
Policy, includes senior management representatives and assists executive


management in its oversight of the accuracy
and timeliness of our disclosures, as well as in implementing and evaluating
our overall disclosure process. As part of our disclosure process, senior
finance and operational representatives from all of our corporate divisions and
business units prepare quarterly reports regarding their current quarter
operational performance, future trends, subsequent events, internal controls,
changes in internal controls and other accounting and disclosure-relevant
information.  These quarterly reports are
reviewed by certain key corporate finance representatives.  These corporate finance representatives also
conduct quarterly interviews on a rotating basis with the preparers of selected
quarterly reports. The results of the quarterly reports and related interviews
are reviewed by the Disclosure Committee. 
Finance representatives also conduct reviews with our senior management
team, our internal and external counsel and other appropriate personnel
involved in the disclosure process, as appropriate. Additionally, senior
finance and operational representatives provide internal certifications
regarding the accuracy of information they provide that is utilized in the
preparation of our periodic public reports filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  Financial results
and other financial information also are reviewed with the Audit Committee of
the board of directors on a quarterly basis. As required by applicable regulatory
requirements, the Chief Executive Officers and the Chief Financial Officer
review and make various certifications regarding the accuracy of our periodic
public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, our
disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial
reporting. With the assistance of the Disclosure Committee, we will continue to
assess and monitor our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal
controls over financial reporting, and will make refinements as necessary.

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards and Laws

On December 16, 2004, the

Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)

issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123R”),
which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (“

SFAS 123”).  SFAS No. 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

,
and amends FASB Statement No. 95,

Statement
of Cash Flows

.  Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123R
is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123.  However, SFAS No. 123R
requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair
values.  Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.

SFAS No. 123R must be adopted by the Company no later than April 1,
2006.  Early adoption will be permitted
in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued.  The
Company expects to adopt SFAS No. 123R on April 1, 2006.

SFAS No. 123R permits public companies to adopt its requirements
using one of two methods:

•

A “modified prospective” method in which
compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based
on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share-based payments granted
after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for
all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R
that remain unvested on the effective date.

•

A “modified retrospective” method which
includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above,
but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized
under SFAS 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) all prior
periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of adoption.

The Company has not yet determined which method it will use.

As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company
currently accounts for share-based payments to employees using Opinion 25’s intrinsic
value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for
employee stock options.  Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R’s
fair value method will have a significant impact on the Company’s results of
operations, although it will have no impact on its overall financial position.
 The impact of adoption of SFAS No. 123R cannot be predicted at this
time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the
future.


On November 24, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151,

Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4

(“SFAS No. 151”). The standard requires that abnormal
amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs within inventory should be excluded
from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred.  The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are
applicable to inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2005.  The Company expects the adoption
of SFAS No. 151 will not have a material impact on our financial position
or results of operations.

On December 15, 2004 the FASB issued Statement No. 153
(“SFAS No. 153”),

Exchanges of
Nonmonetary Assets

—

an Amendment
of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29

.

This
standard requires exchanges of productive assets to be accounted for at fair
value, rather than at carryover basis, unless (1) neither the asset
received nor the asset surrendered has a fair value that is determinable within
reasonable limits or (2) the transactions lack commercial substance. The
new standard is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2005. 
The Company expects the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will not have a
material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

On October 22,
2004, the President of the United States signed the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004 (the “Act”). The Act raises a number of issues with respect to
accounting for income taxes.  For
companies that pay U.S. income taxes on manufacturing activities in the U.S.,
the Act provides a deduction from taxable income equal to a stipulated
percentage of qualified income from domestic production activities.  The manufacturing deduction provided by the
Act replaces the extraterritorial income (“ETI”) deduction currently in
place.  We currently derive benefits from
the ETI exclusion which was repealed by the Act.  Our exclusion for fiscal 2005, 2006, and 2007
will be limited to 95%, 75%, and 45% of the otherwise allowable exclusion and
no exclusion will be available in fiscal 2008 and thereafter.  The Act also creates a temporary incentive
for U.S. multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by
providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
controlled foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of
limitations. The Act also provides for other changes in tax law that will
affect a variety of taxpayers.  On December 21,
2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued two FASB Staff
Positions (“FSP”) regarding the accounting implications of the Act related to (1) the
deduction for qualified domestic production activities and (2) the
one-time tax benefit for the repatriation of foreign earnings. The FASB
determined that the deduction for qualified domestic production activities
should be accounted for as a special deduction under FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

.  The FASB also confirmed, that upon deciding
that some amount of earnings will be repatriated, a company must record in that
period the associated tax liability.  The
guidance in the FSPs applies to financial statements for periods ending after
the date the Act was enacted.

We are evaluating
the Act at this time and have not yet determined whether we will avail
ourselves of the opportunity of the one-time tax benefit for the repatriation
of foreign earnings.  We plan to complete
our assessment before the end of fiscal 2006 and are not currently in a
position to estimate a range of possible repatriation amounts.

Inflation

Our management currently believes that inflation has not had a material
impact on continuing operations.


Item 7A. 
QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market
rates and prices.  Our market risk
exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency
exchange rates and market prices.  Our
market risk sensitive instruments are classified as instruments entered into
for purposes “other than trading.”  Our
views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may
occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may
occur, since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based
upon actual fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and
market prices and the timing of transactions.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes
in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio.  We do not use derivative financial
instruments in our investment portfolio. 
We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio
consisting primarily of debt instruments with high credit quality and
relatively short average maturities.  We
also manage our interest rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash
equivalent balances such that we are typically able to hold our investments to
maturity.  As of March 31, 2005, our
cash equivalents and short-term investments included debt securities of $551.4
million.

The following table presents the amounts and
related weighted average interest rates of our investment portfolio as of March 31,
2005 (amounts in thousands):

Our short-term investments generally mature between three months and
thirty months.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We transact business in many different foreign currencies and may be
exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, particularly GBP and EUR. The volatility of GBP and EUR (and
all other applicable currencies) will be monitored frequently throughout the
coming year.  When appropriate, we enter
into hedging transactions in order to mitigate our risk from foreign currency
fluctuations. We will continue to use hedging programs in the future and may
use currency forward contracts, currency options and/or other derivative
financial instruments commonly utilized to reduce financial market risks if it
is determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk.  We do not hold or purchase any foreign
currency contracts for trading purposes. 
As of March 31, 2005, we had no outstanding hedging contracts.

Market Price Risk

With regard to the structured stock
repurchase transactions described in Note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, at those times when we have structured stock repurchase
transactions outstanding, it is possible that at settlement we could take
delivery of shares at an effective repurchase price higher than the then market
price.  As of March 31, 2005, we had
no structured stock repurchase transactions outstanding.

.  CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The
Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive
Officers and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by
this report.  Disclosure controls and
procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that (i) information
required to be disclosed in the company’s reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) information
is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive
Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures.  Based on
this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing,
summarizing, and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover
failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required
to be set forth in our periodic reports.


Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over
financial reporting.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The
Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. 
Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
management, including our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer,
the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal
control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework
in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this evaluation, the Company’s
management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of March 31, 2005.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.  Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005 as stated in their report on
pages F-1 and F-2.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Activision, Inc.:

We have completed an integrated audit of Activision, Inc.’s
2005 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2005 and audits of its 2004 and 2003

consolidated

financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Our opinions,
based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
listed in the index appearing under Item 8, present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Activision, Inc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”)
at March 31, 2005 and 2004 and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2005
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.  In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed
in the index appearing under Item 8, presents fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated

financial statements.
 These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based
on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

F-1

Internal control over financial
reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment,
included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005 based on criteria
established in

Internal Control - Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,
2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.  The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting.  Our responsibility is to express
opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our
audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
 Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects.  An audit of internal
control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Activision, Inc.
(“Activision” or “we”) is a leading international publisher of interactive
entertainment software products.  We have
built a company with a diverse portfolio of products that spans a wide range of
categories and target markets and that is used on a variety of game hardware
platforms and operating systems.  We have
created, licensed and acquired a group of highly recognizable brands, which we
market to a variety of consumer demographics. 
Our products cover diverse game categories including action/adventure,
action sports, racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person action and
strategy.  Our target customer base
ranges from casual players to game enthusiasts, children to adults and
mass-market consumers to “value” buyers. 
We currently offer our products primarily in versions that operate on
the Sony PlayStation 2 (“PS2”), Nintendo GameCube (“GameCube”) and Microsoft
Xbox (“Xbox”) console systems, Nintendo Game Boy Advance (“GBA”), Sony
PlayStation Portable (“PSP”) and Nintendo Dual Screen (“NDS”) hand-held devices
and the personal computer (“PC”).  In
prior years, we have also offered our products on the Sony PlayStation (“PS1”)
and Nintendo 64 (“N64”) console systems and Nintendo Game Boy Color (“GBC”)
hand-held device.  We also intend on
developing titles for the next-generation console systems being developed by
Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft.

Our publishing business involves the development,
marketing and sale of products directly, by license or through our affiliate
label program with certain third-party publishers.  Our distribution business consists of
operations in Europe that provide logistical and sales services to third-party
publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations
and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

We maintain operations in the United States, Canada,
the United Kingdom (“UK”), Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, Australia,
Sweden and the Netherlands.  In fiscal
year 2005, international operations contributed approximately 50% of
consolidated net revenues.

Principles of
Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Activision, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash, Cash
Equivalents and Short-term Investments

Cash and cash equivalents include cash, money
markets and short-term investments with original maturities of not more than 90
days.

Short-term investments generally mature between three
and thirty months.  Investments with
maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their
liquid nature and because such securities represent the investment of cash that
is available for current operations.  All
of our short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are
carried at fair market value with unrealized appreciation (depreciation)
reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
shareholders’ equity.  The specific
identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed with
realized gains and losses reflected in investment income, net.

Concentration of
Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject us to
concentration of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments
and accounts receivable.  We place our
temporary cash investments with financial institutions.  At various times during the fiscal years
ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, we had deposits in excess of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limit at these financial institutions.

Our customer base includes retail outlets and
distributors, including mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores,
discount warehouses and game specialty stores in the United States and
countries worldwide.

F-7

We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers
and maintain allowances for potential credit losses.  We generally do not require collateral or
other security from our customers.  As of
and for the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we had one customer
that accounted for 23%, 20% and 16%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues
and 41%, 39% and 46%, respectively, of consolidated accounts receivable,
net.    This customer was the same customer
in all periods and was a customer of both our publishing and distribution
businesses.

Financial
Instruments

The estimated fair values of financial instruments
have been determined using available market information and valuation
methodologies described below.  However,
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein may not be
indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange.  The use of different market assumptions or
valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value
amounts.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair
value due to their short-term nature. 
Short-term investments are carried at fair value with fair values being
estimated based on quoted market prices.

We account for derivative instruments in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” SFAS No. 138, “Accounting
for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an amendment
of SFAS 133” and SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 133, 138 and 149 require
that all derivatives, including foreign exchange contracts, be recognized in
the balance sheet in other current assets or accrued expenses at their fair
value.

We utilize forward contracts in order to reduce
financial market risks.  These
instruments are used to hedge foreign currency exposures of underlying assets,
liabilities, or certain forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions.  Our accounting policies for these instruments
are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as hedging
transactions.  Changes in fair value of
derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, are highly effective, and
qualify as hedging instruments, are recorded in other comprehensive income
until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings within the financial
statement line item consistent with the hedged item.  Any ineffective portion of a derivative
change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.  Changes in fair value of derivatives that do
not qualify as hedging instruments are recorded in earnings.  The fair value of foreign currency contracts
is estimated based on the spot rate of the various hedged currencies as of the
end of the period.  As of March 31,
2005 and 2004, we had no outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts.

Equity Investments

From time to time, we may make a capital investment
and hold a minority interest in a third-party developer in connection with
entertainment software products to be developed by such developer for us.  We account for those capital investments over
which we have the ability to exercise significant influence using the equity
method.  For those investments over which
we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, we account for
our investment using the cost method.

Software
Development Costs

Software development costs
include payments made to independent software developers under development
agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for internally developed products.

We account for software
development costs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(“SFAS”) No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be
Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.” 
Software development costs are capitalized once technological
feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be
recoverable.  Technological feasibility
of a product encompasses both technical design documentation and game design
documentation.  For products where proven
technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle.  Technological feasibility is evaluated

F-8

on a product-by-product
basis.  Prior to a product’s release, we
expense, as part of cost of sales — software royalties and amortization,
capitalized costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable.  Capitalized costs for those products that are
cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period
of cancellation.  Amounts related to
software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to
product development expense.  We evaluate
the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.  The
recoverability of capitalized software development costs is evaluated based on
the expected performance of the specific products for which the costs
relate.  Criteria used to evaluate
expected product performance include: 
historical performance of comparable products using comparable
technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and estimated
performance of a sequel product based on the performance of the product on
which the sequel is based.

Commencing upon product
release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of sales
— software royalties and amortization based on the ratio of current revenues to
total projected revenues, generally resulting in an amortization period of six
months or less.  For products that have
been released in prior periods, we evaluate the future recoverability of
capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis. 
The primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance.

Significant management
judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility
is established, as well as in the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of
capitalized costs.  In evaluating the
recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product
performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs
to be incurred.  If revised forecasted or
actual product sales are less than and/or revised forecasted or actual costs
are greater than the original forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability
analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in
any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge.

Intellectual
Property Licenses

Intellectual property license
costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for
use of their trademarks, copyrights, software, technology or other intellectual
property or proprietary rights in the development of our products.  Depending upon the agreement with the rights
holder, we may obtain the rights to use acquired intellectual property in
multiple products over multiple years, or alternatively, for a single product.

We evaluate the future
recoverability of capitalized intellectual property licenses on a quarterly
basis.  The recoverability of capitalized
intellectual property license costs is evaluated based on the expected
performance of the specific products in which the licensed trademark or
copyright is to be used.  As many of our
intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple
years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property
license costs based on certain qualitative factors such as the success of other
products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property,
whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series
based on the intellectual property and the rights holder’s continued promotion
and exploitation of the intellectual property. 
Prior to the related product’s release, we expense, as part of cost of
sales — intellectual property licenses, capitalized intellectual property costs
when we believe such amounts are not recoverable.  Capitalized intellectual property costs for
those products that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product
development expense in the period of cancellation.  Criteria used to evaluate expected product
performance include: historical performance of comparable products using
comparable technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and
estimated performance of a sequel product based on the performance of the
product on which the sequel is based.

Commencing upon the related
product’s release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are
amortized to cost of sales — intellectual property licenses based on the ratio
of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for
all products in which the licensed property will be utilized.  As intellectual property license contracts
may extend for multiple years, the amortization of capitalized intellectual
property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one
year.  For intellectual property included
in products that have been released and unreleased products, we evaluate the
future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.  The primary evaluation criterion is actual
title performance.

F-9

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the
recoverability of capitalized costs.

In evaluating the recoverability of
capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes
forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred.  If revised forecasted or actual product sales
are less than, and/or revised forecasted or actual costs are greater than, the
original forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis,
the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given
quarter, which could result in an impairment charge.  Additionally, as noted above, as many of our
intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple
years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property
license costs based on certain qualitative factors such as the success of other
products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property,
whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series
based on the intellectual property and the rights holder’s continued promotion
and exploitation of the intellectual property. 
Material differences may result in the amount and timing of charges for
any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different
estimates in evaluating these qualitative factors.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out) or market.

Property and
Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation and amortization are provided
using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives
or the lease term:  buildings, 25 to 33
years; computer equipment, office furniture and other equipment, 2 to 5 years;
leasehold improvements, through the life of the lease.  When assets are retired or disposed of, the
cost and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed and any resultant gains
or losses are recognized in current operations.

Goodwill

We account for goodwill using the provisions of SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangibles.”  SFAS No. 142
addresses financial accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill
and other intangible assets.  Under SFAS No. 142,
goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and should not be
amortized but rather tested at least annually for impairment.  An impairment loss should be recognized if
the carrying amount of goodwill is not recoverable and its carrying amount
exceeds its fair value.  In accordance
with SFAS No. 142, we have not amortized goodwill during the years ended March 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003.

Revenue
Recognition

We recognize revenue from the
sale of our products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our
customers.  Certain products are sold to
customers with a street date (the date that products are made widely available
for sale by retailers).  For these
products we recognize revenue no earlier than the street date.  Revenue from product sales is recognized
after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection.  With respect to license agreements that
provide customers the right to make multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed
amounts, revenue is recognized upon delivery of such copies.  Per copy royalties on sales that exceed the
guarantee are recognized as earned.  In
addition, in order to recognize revenue for both product sales and licensing
transactions, persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection
of the related receivable must be probable. 
Revenue recognition also determines the timing of certain expenses,
including cost of sales — intellectual property licenses and cost of sales —
software royalties and amortization.

Sales incentives or other consideration given by us to
our customers is accounted for in accordance with the Financial Accounting
Standards Board’s Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue 01-9, “Accounting
for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the
Vendor’s Products).”  In accordance with
EITF Issue 01-9, sales incentives and other consideration that are considered
adjustments of the selling price of our products, such as rebates and product
placement fees, are reflected as reductions of revenue.  Sales incentives and other consideration that
represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received, such as the
appearance of our products in a customer’s national circular ad, are reflected
as sales and marketing expenses.

F-10

Allowance
for Returns and Price Protection

In determining the
appropriate unit shipments to our customers, we benchmark our titles using
historical and industry data.  We closely monitor and analyze the historical
performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by
other publishers and the anticipated timing of other releases in order to
assess future demands of current and upcoming titles.  Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and
subsequent reorders are evaluated to ensure that quantities are sufficient to
meet the demands from the retail markets but at the same time, are controlled
to prevent excess inventory in the channel.

We may permit product returns
from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain
conditions.  In general, price protection
refers to the circumstances when we elect to decrease the wholesale price of a
product by a certain amount and, when granted and applicable, allows customers
a credit against amounts owed by such customers to Activision with respect to
open and/or future invoices.  The
conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products
or price protection are, among other things, compliance with applicable payment
terms, delivery to us of weekly inventory and sell-through reports, and
consistent participation in the launches of our premium title releases.  We may also consider other factors, including
the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market factors.  Management must make estimates of potential
future product returns and price protection related to current period product
revenue.  We estimate the amount of
future returns and price protection for current period product revenue
utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and
the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer.  The following factors are used to estimate
the amount of future returns and price protection for a particular title:  historical performance of titles in similar
genres, historical performance of the hardware platform, historical performance
of the brand, console hardware life cycle, Activision sales force and retail
customer feedback, industry pricing, weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory,
absolute quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory, Activision warehouse
on-hand inventory levels, the title’s recent sell-through history (if
available), marketing trade programs and competing titles.  The relative importance of these factors
varies among titles depending upon, among other items, genre, platform,
seasonality and sales strategy. 
Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in
connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in
any accounting period.  Based upon
historical experience we believe our estimates are reasonable.  However, actual returns and price protection
could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a number of reasons
including, among others, a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release
in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor, or
technological obsolescence due to the emergence of new hardware platforms.  Material differences may result in the amount
and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different
judgments or utilizes different estimates in determining the allowances for
returns and price protection.

Shipping and
Handling

Shipping and handling costs, which consist primarily
of packaging and transportation charges incurred to move finished goods to
customers, are included in cost of sales – product costs.

Advertising
Expenses

We expense advertising as incurred, except for
production costs associated with media advertising which are deferred and
charged to expense the first time the related ad is run.  Advertising expenses for the years ended March 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 were approximately $150.7 million, $76.6 million and $60.0
million, respectively, and are included in sales and marketing expense in the
consolidated statements of operations.

F-11

Investment Income,
Net

Investment income, net is comprised of the following,
(amounts in thousands):

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes using SFAS No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes.”  Under SFAS No. 109,
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled.  The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Foreign Currency
Translation

The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries
are their local currencies.  All assets
and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at
the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period, and revenue and expenses
are translated at weighted average exchange rates during the period. The
resulting translation adjustments are reflected as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.

Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive income includes net income, unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) on short-term investments, foreign currency
translation adjustments, and the effective portion of gains or losses on cash flow
hedges that are presented as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities or the disclosure of gain or loss
contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Earnings Per
Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for all periods. 
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding, increased by common stock equivalents.  Common stock equivalents are calculated using
the treasury stock method and represent incremental shares issuable upon
exercise of our outstanding options and warrants and, if applicable in the
period, conversion of our convertible debt. 
However, potential common shares are not included in the denominator of
the diluted earnings per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would
be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded.

F-12

Stock-Based
Compensation and Pro Forma Information

Under SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” compensation expense is recorded for the issuance of stock
options and other stock-based compensation based on the fair value of the stock
options and other stock-based compensation on the date of grant or measurement
date.  Alternatively, SFAS No. 123
allows companies to continue to account for the issuance of stock options and
other stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”  Under APB No. 25, compensation expense
is recorded for the issuance of stock options and other stock-based
compensation based on the intrinsic value of the stock options and other
stock-based compensation on the date of grant or measurement date.  Under the intrinsic value method,
compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant or measurement date only
if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the stock option or
other stock-based compensation exercise price. 
At March 31, 2005, we had several stock-based employee compensation
plans, which are described more fully in Note 14. We account for those plans
under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25 and
related Interpretations.  The following
table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to
stock-based employee compensation:

The fair value of options granted in the years ended March 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 has been estimated at the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the
input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility.  We use the historical stock
price volatility of our common stock over the most recent period that is generally
commensurate with the expected option life as the basis for estimating expected
stock price volatility.  In fiscal 2003,
the historical stock price volatility used was based on the daily, low stock

F-13

price of our common stock, which, in recent years,
resulted in an expected volatility ranging from approximately 65% to 70%.  For options granted during each of the
quarters in the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, the historical stock
price volatility used was based on a weekly stock price observation, using an
average of the high and low stock prices of our common stock, which resulted in
an expected stock price volatility ranging from 45% to 48%.  Management believes such amounts are more representative
of prospective trends.  For purposes of
the above pro forma disclosure, the fair value of options granted is amortized
to stock-based employee compensation cost over the period(s) in which the
related employee services are rendered. 
Accordingly, the pro forma stock-based compensation cost for any period
will typically relate to options granted in both the current period and prior
periods.

For options granted during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
the per share weighted average fair value of options with exercise prices equal
to market value on the date of grant was $4.11, $2.08 and $3.28,
respectively.  The per share weighted
average estimated fair value of Employee Stock Purchase Plan shares granted
during the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $2.12, $1.13 and
$1.63, respectively.

The effects on pro forma disclosures of applying SFAS No. 123
are not likely to be representative of the effects on pro forma disclosures of
future years.

Common stock warrants are granted to non-employees in
connection with the development of software and acquisition of licensing rights
for intellectual property.   In
accordance with EITF No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments that
are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring or in Connection With Selling
Goods or Services,” the fair value of common stock warrants granted is
determined as of the measurement date and is capitalized, expensed and
amortized consistent with our policies relating to software development and
intellectual property license costs.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to conform with the current year’s
presentation.

The Company has reclassified certain auction rate
securities from cash and cash equivalents to short-term investments.  Auction rate securities are variable rate
bonds tied to short-term interest rates with maturities on the face of the
underlying security in excess of 90 days. 
Auction rate securities have interest rate resets through a modified
Dutch auction at predetermined short-term intervals, typically every 7, 28, or
35 days.  Interest paid during a given
period is based upon the interest rate determined during the prior auction.

Although these securities are issued and rated as
long-term bonds, they are priced and traded as short-term instruments because
of the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset.  The Company had historically classified these
instruments as cash and cash equivalents if the reset period between interest
rate resets was 90 days or less, which was based on our ability to liquidate
our holdings or roll our investment over to the next reset period.  The Company’s re-evaluation of the maturity
dates and other provisions associated with the underlying bonds resulted in a
reclassification from cash and cash equivalents to short-term investments of
approximately $301.4 million on the March 31, 2004 balance sheet.  As a result of this balance sheet
reclassification, certain amounts were reclassified in the accompanying
consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2004
and 2003 to reflect the gross purchases and sales of these securities as
investing activities rather than as a component of cash and cash
equivalents.  This change in
classification does not affect previously reported cash flows from operating or
from financing activities in the previously reported consolidated statements of
cash flows or the previously reported consolidated statements of
operations.  As of March 31, 2004,
before these revisions in classification, $301.4 million of these current
investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated
balance sheet.  For the years ended March 31,
2004 and 2003, as a result of these revisions in classification, net cash used
in investing activities related to these current investments increased $155.0
million and $146.4 million, respectively.

Splits

In April 2003, the Board of Directors approved a
three-for-two split of our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a
50% stock dividend.  The split was paid
on June 6, 2003 to shareholders of record as of May 16, 2003.  In February 2004, the Board of Directors
approved a second three-for-two split of our outstanding common shares effected
in the form of a 50% stock dividend.  The
split was paid on March 15, 2004 to shareholders of record as of February 23,
2004.  In February 2005, the Board
of Directors approved a four-for-three split of our outstanding common shares
effected in the form of a 33-1/3% stock dividend.  The split was paid March 22, 2005 to
shareholders of record as of March 7, 2005.  The par value of our common stock was
maintained at the pre-split amount of $.000001.   The consolidated financial statements and
Notes thereto, including all share and per share data, have been restated as if
the stock splits had occurred as of the earliest period presented.

On March 7, 2005, in connection with our stock
split, all shares of common stock held as treasury stock were formally
cancelled and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common
Stock.

3.

Acquisitions

During the three years ended March 31, 2005, we
separately completed the acquisition of four privately held interactive
software development companies.  We
accounted for these acquisitions in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations.”   SFAS No. 141
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations,
requiring that the purchase method be used to account and report for all
business combinations.  These
acquisitions have further enabled us to implement our multi-platform
development strategy by bolstering our internal product development
capabilities for console systems and personal computers and strengthening our
position in the first-person action, action and action sports game
categories.  A significant portion of the
purchase price for all of these acquisitions was assigned to goodwill as the
primary asset we acquired in each of the transactions was an assembled
workforce with proven technical and design talent with a history of high
quality product creation.  Pro forma
consolidated statements of operations for these acquisitions are not shown, as
they would not differ materially from reported results.

Auction rate securities are securities that are
structured with short-term reset dates of generally less than 90 days but with
maturities in excess of 90 days.  At the
end of the reset period, investors can sell or continue to hold the securities
at par.  These securities are classified
in the table below based on their legal stated maturity dates.

The following table summarizes the maturities of our
investments in debt securities as of March 31, 2005 (amounts in
thousands):

For the year ended March 31, 2005, net realized
gains on short-term investments consisted of $471,000 of gross realized gains
and no gross realized losses.  For the
year ended March 31, 2004, net realized gains on short-term investments
consisted of $25,000 of gross realized gains and $4,000 of gross realized
losses.  For the year ended March 31,
2003, net realized gains on short-term investments consisted of $350,000 of
gross realized gains and $116,000 of gross realized losses.

In accordance
with EITF 03-1, “

The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,”

the
fair value of investments in an unrealized loss position for which an
other-than-temporary impairment has not been recognized was $508,224,000 and
$28,583,000 at March 31, 2005 and 2004, 
respectively, with related gross unrealized losses of $4,144,000 and
$66,000, respectively.  At March 31,
2005, the gross unrealized losses were comprised mostly of unrealized losses on
corporate bonds, U.S. agency issues, and asset-back securities with $464,000 of
unrealized loss being in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve
months or greater.  At March 31,
2004, the gross unrealized losses were comprised mostly of unrealized losses on
corporate bonds, U.S. agency issues, and asset-back securities with $21,000 of
unrealized loss being in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve
months or greater.

The Company’s investment portfolio consists of
government and corporate securities with effective maturities less than 30
months.  The longer the term of the
securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market rates of
interest and yields on bonds. 
Investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible
impairment.  When evaluating the
investments, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent
to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the
issuer, and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the investment for a
period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market
value.  The Company has the intent and
ability to hold these securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for
a forecasted recovery of fair value up to (or beyond) the initial cost of the
investment.  The Company expects to
realize the full value of all of these investments upon maturity or sale.

Software
Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses

As of March 31, 2005, capitalized software
development costs included $61.3 million of internally developed software costs
and $30.3 million of payments made to third-party software developers.  As of March 31, 2004, capitalized
software development costs included $35.3 million of internally developed
software costs and $51.5 million of payments made to third-party software
developers.  Capitalized intellectual
property licenses were $35.7 million and $48.5 million as of March 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. 
Amortization and write-offs of capitalized software development costs
and intellectual property licenses, combined, was $134.8 million, $87.9 million
and $100.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

During the three months ended
December 31, 2003, we completed a comprehensive review of our product
portfolio in which we evaluated each product based on a number of criteria,
including: the strength of the franchise, the projected product quality, the
potential responsiveness of the product to aggressive marketing support and the
financial risk in the event of product failure. As a result of this review at the
time, we found that we had an extensive slate of high-potential properties in
development. However, we also found that certain projects had a lower
likelihood of achieving acceptable levels of operating performance and that
continued pursuit of these projects would create a substantial opportunity cost
as it related to our slate of high-potential projects. Accordingly, in the
three months ended December 31, 2003, we canceled the development of ten
products which we believed were unlikely to produce an acceptable level of
return on our investment. In connection with the cancellation of these
products, we recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $21 million in the
quarter ended December 31, 2003 which is included in the consolidated
statement of operations in product development expense.

Operations
by Reportable Segments and Geographic Area

We operate two business segments: (i) publishing
of interactive entertainment software and (ii) distribution of interactive
entertainment software and hardware products.

Publishing refers to the development, marketing and
sale of products directly, by license or through our affiliate label program
with certain third-party publishers.  In
the United States, we primarily sell our products on a direct basis to
mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses and
game specialty stores.  We conduct our
international publishing activities through offices in the UK, Germany, France,
Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, Canada and Japan.  Our products are sold internationally on a
direct-to-retail basis and through third-party distribution and licensing
arrangements and through our wholly-owned distribution subsidiaries located in
the UK, the Netherlands and Germany.

Distribution refers to our operations in the UK, the
Netherlands and Germany that provide logistical and sales services to
third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own
publishing operations and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Resources are allocated to each of these segments
using information on their respective net revenues and operating profits before
interest and taxes.

The accounting policies of these segments are the same
as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.  Transactions between segments are eliminated
in consolidation.

Revenues
by platform were as follows (amounts in thousands):

A
significant portion of our revenues is derived from products based on a
relatively small number of popular brands each year.  In fiscal 2005, 37% of our consolidated net
revenues (48% of worldwide publishing net revenues) was derived from three
brands, which accounted for 16%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of consolidated net
revenues (21%, 14% and 13%, respectively, of worldwide publishing net
revenues).  In fiscal 2004, 35% of our
consolidated net revenues (49% of worldwide publishing net revenues) was
derived from three brands, which accounted for 17%, 14% and 4%, respectively,
of consolidated net revenues (24%, 20% and 5%, respectively, of worldwide
publishing net revenues).   In fiscal
2003, 38% of our consolidated net revenues (52% of worldwide publishing net
revenues) was derived from two brands, one of which accounted for 20% and the
other of which accounted for 18% of consolidated net revenues (27% and 25%,
respectively, of worldwide publishing net revenues).

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of
temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for
accounting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  The components of the net deferred tax asset
and liability are as follows (amounts in thousands):

The tax benefits associated with certain net operating
loss carryovers relate to employee stock options.  Pursuant to SFAS No. 109, net operating
losses have been reduced by $30.9 million relating to these items which will be
credited to additional paid-in capital when realized.

F-25

As of March 31, 2005, our available federal net
operating loss carryforward of approximately $153.5 million is subject to
certain limitations as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code.  The net operating loss
carryforwards expire between 2020 and 2024. 
We have various state net operating loss carryforwards totaling $102.5
million which are not subject to limitations under Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code.  We have tax
credit carryforwards of $31.4 million and $22.3 million for federal and state
purposes, respectively, which begin to expire in 2006.

At March 31, 2005, our deferred income tax asset
for tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards was reduced
by a valuation allowance of $25.7 million as compared to $18.9 million in the
prior fiscal year.  Realization of the
deferred tax assets is dependent upon the continued generation of sufficient
taxable income prior to expiration of tax credits and loss carryforwards.  Although realization is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not that the net carrying value of
the deferred tax asset will be realized.

Cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided approximated $59.9
million at March 31, 2005.  Deferred
income taxes on these earnings have not been provided as these amounts are
considered to be permanent in duration.

On October 22, 2004,
the President of the United States signed the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (the “Act”). The Act raises a number of issues with respect to accounting
for income taxes.  For companies that pay
U.S. income taxes on manufacturing activities in the U.S., the Act provides a
deduction from taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified
income from domestic production activities. 
The manufacturing deduction provided by the Act replaces the
extraterritorial income (“ETI”) deduction currently in place.  We currently derive benefits from the ETI
exclusion which was repealed by the Act. 
Our exclusion for fiscal 2005, 2006, and 2007 will be limited to 95%,
75%, and 45% of the otherwise allowable exclusion and no exclusion will be
available in fiscal 2008 and thereafter. 
The Act also creates a temporary incentive for U.S. multinationals to
repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent
dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign
corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations. The Act also
provides for other changes in tax law that will affect a variety of
taxpayers.  On December 21, 2004,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued two FASB Staff
Positions (“FSP”) regarding the accounting implications of the Act related to (1) the
deduction for qualified domestic production activities and (2) the
one-time tax benefit for the repatriation of foreign earnings. The FASB
determined that the deduction for qualified domestic production activities
should be accounted for as a special deduction under FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

.  The FASB also confirmed, that upon deciding
that some amount of earnings will be repatriated, a company must record in that
period the associated tax liability.  The
guidance in the FSPs applies to financial statements for periods ending after
the date the Act was enacted.

We are evaluating
the Act at this time and have not yet determined whether we will avail
ourselves of the opportunity of the one-time tax benefit for the repatriation
of foreign earnings.  We plan to complete
our assessment before the end of fiscal 2006 and are not currently in a
position to estimate a range of possible repatriation amounts.

Commitments and Contingencies

Credit Facilities

We have revolving credit facilities with our
Centresoft subsidiary located in the UK (the “UK Facility”) and our NBG
subsidiary located in Germany (the “German Facility”).  The UK Facility provided Centresoft with the
ability to borrow up to Great British Pounds (“GBP”) 8.0 million ($15.0
million) and GBP 8.0 million ($14.6 million), including issuing letters of
credit, on a revolving basis as of March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Furthermore, under the UK Facility, Centresoft provided a GBP 0.6 million ($1.1
million) and a GBP 0.3 million ($0.5 million) guarantee for the benefit of our
CD Contact subsidiary as of March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  The UK Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus
2.0% as of March 31, 2005 and 2004, is collateralized by substantially all
of the assets of the subsidiary and expires in May 2006.  The UK Facility also contains various
covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios
related to, among others, fixed charges. 
As of March 31, 2005 and 2004, we were in compliance with these
covenants.  No borrowings were
outstanding against the UK Facility as of March 31, 2005 or 2004.  The German Facility provided for revolving
loans up to EUR 0.5 million ($0.6 million) as of both

March 31, 2005 and 2004, bore interest at a
Eurocurrency rate plus 2.5%, is collateralized by certain of the subsidiary’s
property and equipment and has no expiration date.  No borrowings were outstanding against the
German Facility as of March 31, 2005 or 2004.

Developer
and Intellectual Property Contracts

In the normal course of business we enter into
contractual arrangements with third-parties for the development of products, as
well as for the rights to intellectual property.  Under these agreements, we commit to provide
specified payments to a developer, or intellectual property holder, based upon
contractual arrangements.  Typically, the payments to third-party
developers are conditioned upon the achievement by the developers of
contractually specified development milestones. 
These payments to third-party developers and intellectual property
holders typically are deemed to be advances and are recoupable against future
royalties earned by the developer or intellectual property holder based on the
sale of the related game.

Assuming all
contractual provisions are met, the total future minimum contract commitment
for contracts in place as of March 31, 2005 is approximately $62.2
million, which is scheduled to be paid as follows (amounts in thousands):

Marketing
Commitments

In connection with certain
intellectual property right acquisitions and development agreements, we will
commit to spend specified amounts for marketing support for the related game(s)
which is to be developed or in which the intellectual property will be
utilized.  Assuming all contractual
provisions are met, the total future minimum marketing commitment for contracts
in place as of March 31, 2005 is approximately $28.8 million, which is
scheduled to be paid as follows (amounts in thousands):

Lease
Obligations

We lease certain of our facilities under
non-cancelable operating lease agreements.

Facilities rent expense for the years ended March 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $10.6 million, $8.7 million and $7.6

Legal Proceedings

On March 5, 2004, a
class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our current and former
officers and directors.  The complaint,
which asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 based on allegations that our revenues and assets were
overstated during the period between February 1, 2001 and December 17,
2002, was filed in the United States District Court, Central District of
California by the Construction Industry and Carpenters Joint Pension Trust for
Southern Nevada purporting to represent a class of purchasers of Activision
stock.  Five additional purported class
actions have subsequently been filed by Gianni Angeloni, Christopher Hinton,
Stephen Anish, the Alaska Electrical Pension Fund, and Joseph A. Romans
asserting the same claims.  Consistent
with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”), the court
appointed lead plaintiffs consolidating the six putative securities class
actions into a single case.  In an Order
dated May 16, 2005, the court dismissed the consolidated complaint because
the plaintiffs failed to satisfy the heightened pleading standards of the
PSLRA.  The court did, however, give the
lead plaintiffs leave to file an amended consolidated complaint within 30 days
of the order.  We do not know whether the
lead plaintiffs will file an amended consolidated complaint, but in the event
that one is filed, we intend to vigorously defend the case at such time.

In addition, on March 12,
2004, a shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned

Frank
Capovilla, Derivatively on Behalf of Activision, Inc. v. Robert Kotick, et
al.

was filed, purportedly on behalf of Activision, which in large
measure asserts the identical claims set forth in the federal class action
lawsuit.  That complaint was filed in California Superior Court for the
County of Los Angeles. Also, on March 22, 2005, a new derivative lawsuit
captioned

Ramalingham Balamohan, Derivatively on Behalf of
Nominal Defendant Activision, Inc. v. Robert Kotick, et al.

was
filed in the Federal Court of Los Angeles.  This complaint makes the same
allegations as the previous complaints, but it names all the current directors
as defendants.  We strongly deny allegations in both derivative cases and
will vigorously defend these cases.  In the California derivative case,
Activision, as nominal defendant, filed a motion to stay all proceedings. 
The case, and all motion practice and responsive pleadings, has been held in
abeyance pending a status conference with the court. In the Federal derivative
case, plaintiff filed a notice of dismissal of the action, without prejudice on
or about June 3, 2005.

On July 11, 2003, we were informed by the staff
of the Securities and Exchange Commission that the Securities and Exchange
Commission has commenced a non-public formal investigation captioned “In the
Matter of Certain Video Game Manufacturers and Distributors.” The investigation
appears to be focused on certain accounting practices common to the interactive
entertainment industry, with specific emphasis on revenue recognition.  In connection with this inquiry, the
Securities and Exchange Commission submitted to us a request for
information.  We responded to this
inquiry on September 2, 2003.  To
date, we have not received a request from the Securities and Exchange
Commission for any additional information. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission staff also informed us that other
companies in the video game industry received similar requests for information.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has advised us that this request for
information should not be construed as an indication from the Securities and
Exchange Commission or its staff that any violation of the law has occurred,
nor should it reflect negatively on any person, entity or security. We

F-28

have cooperated and intend to continue to cooperate
fully with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the conduct of this
inquiry.

On June 30, 2003, we
terminated our Star Trek Merchandising License Agreement with Viacom Consumer
Products, Inc. and filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of
California for breach of contract and constructive trust against Viacom
Consumer Products and Viacom International, Inc. (“Viacom”). On August 15,
2003, Viacom filed its response to our complaint as well as a cross-complaint
alleging, among other matters, a breach of contract by Activision and seeking
claimed damages in excess of $50 million.

On February 23, 2005, we reached an agreement with Viacom that
settled the legal disputes.  As a result
of the settlement, all pending lawsuits filed by each party in the Superior
Court in Los Angeles regarding this matter have been dismissed by court order
dated March 18, 2005.   The
settlement had no material impact on the financial results of Activision’s
operations.

In addition, we are party to other routine claims and
suits brought by us and against us in the ordinary course of business,
including disputes arising over the ownership of intellectual property rights,
contractual claims and collection matters. 
In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the
outcome of such routine claims will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Stock
Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans

Stock
Option Plans

We sponsor several stock option plans for the benefit
of officers, employees, consultants and others.

On February 28, 1992, the shareholders of
Activision approved the Activision 1991 Stock Option and Stock Award Plan, as
amended, (the “1991 Plan”) which permits the granting of “Awards” in the form
of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options (“ISOs”), stock
appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock awards, deferred stock awards
and other common stock-based awards to directors, officers, employees,
consultants and others.  The total number
of shares of common stock available for distribution under the 1991 Plan is
34,050,000.  The 1991 Plan requires
available shares to consist in whole or in part of authorized and unissued
shares or treasury shares.  There were no
shares remaining available for grant under the 1991 Plan as of March 31,
2005.

On September 23, 1998, the shareholders of
Activision approved the Activision 1998 Incentive Plan, as amended (the “1998
Plan”).  The 1998 Plan permits the
granting of “Awards” in the form of non-qualified stock options, ISOs, SARs,
restricted stock awards, deferred stock awards and other common stock-based
awards to directors, officers, employees, consultants and others.  The total number of shares of common stock
available for distribution under the 1998 Plan is 13,500,000.  The 1998 Plan requires available shares to
consist in whole or in part of authorized and unissued shares or treasury
shares.  There were approximately 21,200
shares remaining available for grant under the 1998 Plan as of March 31,
2005.

On April 26, 1999, the Board of Directors
approved the Activision 1999 Incentive Plan, as amended (the “1999 Plan”).  The 1999 Plan permits the granting of “Awards”
in the form of non-qualified stock options, ISOs, SARs, restricted stock
awards, deferred share awards and other common stock-based awards to directors,
officers, employees, consultants and others. 
The total number of shares of common stock available for distribution
under the 1999 Plan is 22,500,000.  The
1999 Plan requires available shares to consist in whole or in part of
authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares.  There were approximately 17,900 shares
remaining available for grant under the 1999 Plan as of March 31, 2005.

On August 23, 2001, the shareholders of
Activision approved the Activision 2001 Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2001

awards to directors, officers, employees, consultants and others.  The total number of shares of common stock
available for distribution under the 2001 Plan is 6,750,000.  The 2001 Plan requires available shares to
consist in whole or in part of authorized and unissued shares or treasury
shares.  There were approximately 284,500
shares remaining available for grant under the 2001 Plan as of March 31,
2005.

granting of “Awards” in the form of non-qualified stock options, ISOs, SARs,
restricted stock awards, deferred share awards and other common stock-based
awards to officers (other than executive officers), employees, consultants,

as of March 31, 2005.

On September 19, 2002, the shareholders of
Activision approved the Activision 2002 Executive Incentive Plan (the “2002
Executive Plan”).  The 2002 Executive
Plan permits the granting of “Awards” in the form of non-qualified stock
options, ISOs, SARs, restricted stock awards, deferred share awards and other
common stock-based awards to officers, employees, directors, consultants and
advisors.  The total number of shares of
common stock available for distribution under the 2002 Executive Plan is
7,500,000.  The 2002 Executive Plan
requires available shares to consist in whole or in part of authorized and
unissued shares or treasury shares. 
There were approximately 6,500 shares remaining available for grant
under the 2002 Executive Plan as of March 31, 2005.

On December 16, 2002, the Board of Directors
approved the Activision 2002 Studio Employee Retention Incentive Plan, as
amended (the “2002 Studio Plan”).  The
2002 Studio Plan permits the granting of “Awards” in the form of non-qualified
stock options and restricted stock awards to key studio employees (other than
executive officers) of Activision, our subsidiaries and affiliates and to
contractors and others.    The 2002
Studio Plan requires available shares to consist in whole or in part of
authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares.  The total number of shares of common stock
available for distribution under the 2002 Studio Plan is 4,500,000.  There were approximately 3,100 shares
remaining available for grant under the 2002 Studio Plan as of March 31,
2005.

On April 29, 2003, our Board of Directors
approved the Activision 2003 Incentive Plan (the “2003 Plan”).  The 2003 Plan permits the granting of “Awards”
in the form of non-qualified stock options, SARs, restricted stock awards,
deferred stock awards and other common stock-based awards to directors,
officers, employees, consultants and others. 
The 2003 Plan requires available shares to consist in whole or in part
of authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares.  The total number of shares of common stock
available for distribution under the 2003 Plan is 18,000,000.  There were approximately 16,394,600 shares
remaining available for grant under the 2003 Plan as of March 31, 2005.

The exercise price for Awards issued under the 1991
Plan, 1998 Plan, 1999 Plan, 2001 Plan, 2002 Plan, 2002 Executive Plan, 2002
Studio Plan and 2003 Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) is determined at the
discretion of the Board of Directors (or the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors, which administers the Plans), and for ISOs, is not to be
less than the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant, or in
the case of non-qualified options, must exceed or be equal to 85% of the fair
market value of our common stock at the date of grant.  Options typically become exercisable in
installments over a period not to exceed seven years and must be exercised
within 10 years of the date of grant. 
However, certain options granted to executives vest immediately.  Historically, stock options have been granted
with exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair market value at the date
of grant.

Other Employee Stock Options

In connection with prior employment agreements between
Activision and Robert A. Kotick, Activision’s Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, and Brian G. Kelly, Activision’s Co-Chairman, Mr. Kotick and Mr. Kelly
were granted options to purchase common stock. 
The Board of Directors approved the granting of these options.  Relating to such grants, as of March 31,
2005, approximately 6,228,600 shares were outstanding with a weighted average
exercise price of $2.32.

We additionally have approximately 70,900 options
outstanding to employees as of March 31, 2005, with a weighted average
exercise price of $4.64.  The Board of
Directors approved the granting of these options.  Such options have terms similar to those
options granted under the Plans.

F-30

Director
Warrants

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997, we
issued warrants to purchase 180,000 shares of our common stock, at exercise
prices ranging from $2.63 to $3.08 to two of our outside directors in
connection with their election to the Board. 
Such warrants vested 25% on the first anniversary of the date of grant,
and 12.5% each six months thereafter and expire within 10 years from the date
of grant.  Relating to such warrants, as
of March 31, 2005, no shares were outstanding.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plans

On July 22, 2002, the Board of Directors approved
the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for eligible domestic employees.  The shareholders of Activision subsequently
approved the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan on September 19, 2002.  Then, on February 11, 2003, the Board of
Directors approved the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan For International
Employees. The primary terms of the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the
2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan For International Employees (collectively the
“2002 Purchase Plans”) are the same. 
Under the 2002 Purchase Plans, up to 1,125,000 shares of our common
stock may be purchased by eligible employees during two overlapping,
twelve-month offering periods that commence each April 1 and October 1
(the “Offering Period”).  At any point in
time, employees may participate in only one Offering Period.  The first day of each Offering Period is
referred to as the “Offering Date.”  
Common stock is purchased by 2002 Purchase Plans participants at 85% of
the lesser of fair market value on the Offering Date for the Offering Period
that includes the common stock purchase date or the fair market value on the
common stock purchase date.   Employees
may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross
compensation during an Offering Period, limited to a maximum of 15,000 common
shares per common stock purchase date. 
During the year ended March 31, 2005, employees purchased
approximately 147,800, 50,500 and 262,300 shares at a price of $8.84, $5.29 and
$8.61 per share, respectively, within the 2002 Purchase Plans’ Offering
Periods.  During the year ended March 31,
2004, employees purchased approximately 323,100, 80,000 and 340,400 shares at a
price of $4.11, $5.30 and $4.11 per share, respectively, within the 2002
Purchase Plans’ Offering Periods.

Activity of Employee and Director
Options and Warrants

Activity
of all employee and director options and warrants during the last three fiscal
years was as follows (amounts in thousands, except weighted average exercise
price amounts):

For the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, all options were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market
value on the date of grant.

F-31

The following tables summarize information about all
employee and director stock options and warrants outstanding as of March 31,
2005 (share amounts in thousands):

Non-Employee
Warrants

In prior years, we have granted stock warrants to
third-parties in connection with the development of software and the
acquisition of licensing rights for intellectual property.  The warrants generally vest upon grant and
are exercisable over the term of the warrant. 
The exercise price of third-party warrants is generally greater than or
equal to their fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant.  No third-party warrants were granted during
the year ended March 31, 2005.  As
of March 31, 2005, 702,000 third-party warrants to purchase common stock
were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $6.04 per
share.  No third-party warrants were
granted during the year ended March 31, 2004.  As of March 31, 2004, 2,052,000
third-party warrants to purchase common stock were outstanding with a weighted
average exercise price of $7.13 per share. 
During the year ended March 31, 2003, we granted warrants to a
third-party to purchase 450,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price
of $9.92 per share in connection with, and as partial consideration for, a
license agreement that allows us to utilize intellectual property owned by the
third-party in conjunction with an Activision product.  The warrants vested upon grant and have a
three-year term.  The fair value of the
warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model, assuming a
risk-free rate of 4.18%, a volatility factor of 70% and expected term as noted
above.  The per share weighted average
estimated fair value of the third-party warrants granted during the year ended March 31,
2003 was $4.85 per share.  As of March 31,
2003, 2,646,000 third-party warrants to purchase common stock were outstanding
with a weighted average exercise price of $4.69 per share.

In accordance with EITF 96-18, we measure the fair
value of the securities on the measurement date.  The fair value of each warrant is capitalized
and amortized to expense when the related product is released and the related
revenue is recognized.  Additionally, as
more fully described in Note 1, the recoverability of capitalized software
development costs and intellectual property licenses is evaluated on a
quarterly basis with amounts determined as not recoverable being charged to
expense.  In connection with the
evaluation of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property
licenses, any capitalized amounts for related third-party warrants are
additionally reviewed for recoverability with amounts determined as not
recoverable being amortized to expense. 
For the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, $1.6 million,
$0.2 million and $3.6 million, respectively, was amortized and included in cost
of sales - software royalties and amortization and/or cost of sales -
intellectual property licenses.

F-32

Employee
Retirement Plan

We have a retirement plan covering substantially all
of our eligible employees.  The retirement
plan is qualified in accordance with Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code.  Under the plan, employees
may defer up to 92% of their pre-tax salary, but not more than statutory
limits.  Effective January 1, 2003,
we contribute 20% of each dollar contributed by a participant.  Prior to January 1, 2003, we contributed
5% of each dollar contributed by a participant. 
Our matching contributions to the plan were approximately $905,000,
$700,000, and $320,000 during the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Capital
Transactions

Buyback
Program

During fiscal 2003, our
Board of Directors authorized a buyback program under which we can repurchase
up to $350.0 million of our common stock. Under the program, shares may be
purchased as determined by management, from time to time and within certain
guidelines, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions,
including privately negotiated structured stock repurchase transactions and
through transactions in the options markets. Depending on market conditions and
other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or
from time to time without prior notice.

Under the buyback program, we did
not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the year ended March 31,
2005.  We repurchased approximately 2.5
million shares of our common stock for $12.4 million and 21.6 million shares of
our common stock for $101.4 million, in the years ended March 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively.  In addition,
approximately 2.3 million shares of common stock were acquired in the year
ended March 31, 2004 as a result of the settlement of $10.0 million of
structured stock repurchase transactions entered into in fiscal 2003.  As of March 31, 2005, we had no
outstanding structured stock repurchase transactions.  Structured stock repurchase transactions are
settled in cash or stock based on the market price of our common stock on the
date of the settlement. Upon settlement, we either have our capital investment
returned with a premium or receive shares of our common stock, depending,
respectively, on whether the market price of our common stock is above or below
a pre-determined price agreed in connection with each such transaction.  These transactions are recorded in
shareholders’ equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  As of March 31, 2005, we had
approximately $226.2 million available for utilization under the buyback
program and no outstanding stock repurchase transactions.

Shelf
Registrations

In August 2003, we filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission two amended shelf registration statements, including the
base prospectuses therein. The first shelf registration statement, on Form S-3,
allows us, at any time, to offer any combination of securities described in the
base prospectus in one or more offerings with an aggregate initial offering
price of up to $500,000,000.  Unless we
state otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, we expect to use the
net proceeds from the sale of the securities for general corporate purposes,
including capital expenditures, working capital, repayment or reduction of
long-term and short-term debt and the financing of acquisitions and other
business combinations. We may invest funds that we do not immediately require
in marketable securities.

The second shelf registration statement, on Form S-4,
allows us, at any time, to offer any combination of securities described in the
base prospectus in one or more offerings with an aggregate initial offering
price of up to $250,000,000 in connection with our acquisition of the assets,
business or securities of other companies whether by purchase, merger, or any
other form of business combination.

Shareholders’
Rights Plan

On April 18, 2000, our Board of Directors
approved a shareholders rights plan (the “Rights Plan”).  Under the Rights Plan, each common
shareholder at the close of business on April 19, 2000, received a
dividend of one right for each share of common stock held.  Each right represents the right to purchase
two nine-hundredths (2/900) of a share, as adjusted on account of stock
dividends made since the

F-33

plan’s adoption, of our Series A Junior Preferred
Stock at an exercise price of $8.89, as adjusted on account of stock dividends
made since the plan’s adoption. 
Initially, the rights are represented by our common stock certificates
and are neither exercisable nor traded separately from our common stock.  The rights will only become exercisable if a
person or group acquires 15% or more of the common stock of Activision, or
announces or commences a tender or exchange offer which would result in the
bidder’s beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock.

In the event that any person or group acquires 15% or
more of our outstanding common stock each holder of a right (other than such
person or members of such group) will thereafter have the right to receive upon
exercise of such right, in lieu of shares of Series A Junior Preferred
Stock, the number of shares of common stock of Activision having a value equal
to two times the then current exercise price of the right.  If we are acquired in a merger or other
business combination transaction after a person has acquired 15% or more of our
common stock, each holder of a right will thereafter have the right to receive
upon exercise of such right a number of the acquiring company’s common shares
having a market value equal to two times the then current exercise price of the
right.  For persons who, as of the close
of business on April 18, 2000, beneficially own 15% or more of the common
stock of Activision, the Rights Plan “grandfathers” their current level of
ownership, so long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of
certain limitations.

We may redeem the rights for $.01 per right at any
time until the first public announcement of the acquisition of beneficial
ownership of 15% of our common stock.  At
any time after a person has acquired 15% or more (but before any person has
acquired more than 50%) of our common stock, we may exchange all or part of the
rights for shares of common stock at an exchange ratio of one share of common
stock per right.  The rights expire on April 18,
2010.

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards and Laws

On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123R”),
which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (“

SFAS 123”).  SFAS No. 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

,
and amends FASB Statement No. 95,

Statement
of Cash Flows

.  Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123R
is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123.  However, SFAS No. 123R
requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair
values.  Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.

SFAS No. 123R
must be adopted by the Company no later than April 1, 2006. Early adoption
will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been
issued.  The Company expects to adopt SFAS No. 123R on April 1,
2006.

SFAS No. 123R
permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods:

•

A “modified
prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the
effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all
share-based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the
requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the
effective date of SFAS No. 123R that remain unvested on the effective
date.

•

A “modified
retrospective” method which includes the requirements of the modified
prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based
on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS 123 for purposes of pro forma
disclosures either (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior
interim periods of the year of adoption.

The Company has
not yet determined which method it will use.

As permitted by
SFAS 123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to employees
using Opinion 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no
compensation cost for employee stock options.  Accordingly, the adoption
of SFAS No. 123R’s fair value method will have a significant impact on the
Company’s results of operations, although it will have no impact on its overall
financial position.  The impact of adoption of SFAS No. 123R cannot
be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based
payments granted in the future.

On November 24, 2004,
the FASB issued Statement No. 151,

Inventory
Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4

(“SFAS No. 151”).
The standard requires that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs
within inventory should be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed
when incurred.  The provisions of SFAS No. 151
are applicable to inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2005.  The Company expects the adoption
of SFAS No. 151 will not have a material impact on our financial position
or results of operations.

On December 15, 2004 the
FASB issued Statement No. 153 (“SFAS No. 153”),

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets

—

an Amendment of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29

.

This
standard requires exchanges of productive assets to be accounted for at fair
value, rather than at carryover basis, unless (1) neither the asset
received nor the asset surrendered has a fair value that is determinable within
reasonable limits or (2) the transactions lack commercial substance. The
new standard is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2005. 
The Company expects the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will not have a
material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

On October 22, 2004,
the President of the United States signed the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (the “Act”). The Act raises a number of issues with respect to accounting
for income taxes.  For companies that pay
U.S. income taxes on manufacturing activities in the U.S., the Act provides a
deduction from taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified
income from domestic production activities. 
The manufacturing deduction provided by the Act replaces the
extraterritorial income (“ETI”) deduction currently in place.  We currently derive benefits from the ETI
exclusion which was repealed by the Act. 
Our exclusion for fiscal 2005, 2006, and 2007 will be limited to 95%,
75%, and 45% of the otherwise allowable exclusion and no exclusion will be available
in fiscal 2008 and thereafter.  The Act
also creates a temporary incentive for U.S.

F-36

multinationals to repatriate
accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received
deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The
deduction is subject to a number of limitations. The Act also provides for
other changes in tax law that will affect a variety of taxpayers.  On December 21, 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued two FASB Staff Positions (“FSP”)
regarding the accounting implications of the Act related to (1) the
deduction for qualified domestic production activities and (2) the
one-time tax benefit for the repatriation of foreign earnings. The FASB
determined that the deduction for qualified domestic production activities
should be accounted for as a special deduction under FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

.  The FASB also confirmed, that upon deciding
that some amount of earnings will be repatriated, a company must record in that
period the associated tax liability.  The
guidance in the FSPs applies to financial statements for periods ending after
the date the Act was enacted.

We are evaluating
the Act at this time and have not yet determined whether we will avail
ourselves of the opportunity of the one-time tax benefit for the repatriation
of foreign earnings.  We plan to complete
our assessment before the end of fiscal 2006 and are not currently in a position
to estimate a range of possible repatriation amounts.

Subsequent
Events

On April 4, 2005, we held
Special Meeting of Stockholders in Santa Monica, California.  One item was submitted to a vote of the
stockholders: To approve an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to increase the number of authorized
shares of common stock from 225,000,000 to 450,000,000.  The amendment to the Company’s Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to increase the number of
authorized shares of common stock from 225,000,000 to 450,000,000 was approved.
