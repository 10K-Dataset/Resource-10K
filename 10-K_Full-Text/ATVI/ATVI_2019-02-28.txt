Item 1.    BUSINESS

Overview

Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and
distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers ("PC"s), and mobile devices. We also operate esports leagues and events and create film and television content based on our
intellectual property. The terms "Activision
Blizzard," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

The
Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. In connection with the 2008 business combination by and among the
Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A. ("Vivendi"), and Vivendi Games, Inc., then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi, we were renamed Activision
Blizzard, Inc.

The
common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol "ATVI."



The King Acquisition

On February 23, 2016 (the "King Closing Date"), we acquired King Digital Entertainment, a leading interactive mobile entertainment
company ("King"), by purchasing all of its outstanding shares (the "King Acquisition"). We made this acquisition because we believed that the addition of King's highly complementary mobile business
positioned us as a global leader in interactive entertainment across mobile, console, and PC platforms, and aligned us for future growth. The aggregate purchase price of approximately
$5.8 billion was funded with $3.6 billion of existing cash and $2.2 billion of cash from new debt issued by the Company. King's results of operations since the King Closing Date
are included in our consolidated financial statements.

Our Strategy and Vision

Our objective is to continue to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of high-quality interactive entertainment
content and services, as well as related media, that deliver engaging entertainment experiences on a year-round basis. In pursuit of this objective we focus on three strategic pillars: expanding
audience reach; driving deep consumer engagement; and providing more opportunities for player investment.

Expanding audience reach.

Building on our strong established franchises and creating new franchises through compelling new content is at
the core of
our business. We endeavor to reach as many consumers as possible either through: (1) the purchase of our content and services; (2) engagement in our free-to-play games, which allow
consumers to play games with no up-front cost but provide for player investment through sales of downloadable content or via microtransactions; or (3) engagement in other types of media based
on our franchises, such as esports and film and television content.

Driving deep consumer engagement.

Our high-quality entertainment content not only expands our audience reach, but it also drives deep
engagement with
our franchises. We design our games, as well as related media, to provide a depth of content that keeps consumers engaged for a long period of time following a game's release, delivering more value to
our players and additional growth opportunities for our franchises.

Providing more opportunities for player investment.

Increasingly, our consumers are connected to our games online through consoles, PCs,
 and mobile
devices. This allows us to offer additional digital player investment opportunities directly to our consumers on a year-round basis. In addition to purchasing full games or subscriptions, players can
invest in certain of our games and franchises by purchasing incremental "in-game" content (including larger downloadable content or smaller content, via microtransactions). These digital revenue
streams tend to be more recurring and have relatively higher profit margins. Further, if executed properly, additional player investment can increase engagement as it provides more frequent and
incremental content for our players. In addition, we have begun to generate revenue through offering advertising within certain of our franchises, and we believe there are opportunities to grow new
forms of player investment through esports, film and television, and consumer products. We are in the early stages of developing these new revenue streams.

Our
strategy is ultimately aimed at creating shareholder value and enhancing returns. We strive to increase profitability, cash flows, and return on capital—and to do so
while keeping our company a great place to work for our employees.



Reportable Segments

Based upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments as follows:

(i)    Activision Publishing, Inc.

Activision Publishing, Inc. ("Activision") is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content,
particularly for the console platforms. Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to
third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products primarily based on our internally developed intellectual properties, as
well as some licensed properties.

Activision's
key product franchise is Call of Duty

®

, a first-person shooter for the console and PC platforms. Call of Duty has been the
number one console franchise globally for nine of the last 10 years, based on data from The NPD Group, GfK Chart-Track, and GSD, and our internal estimates of dollar sales on front line games.

In
2010, Activision entered into an exclusive relationship with Bungie, Inc. ("Bungie") to publish games in the Destiny franchise. Effective December 31, 2018, Activision and
Bungie, mutually agreed to terminate their publishing relationship related to the Destiny franchise. As part of this termination, Activision agreed to transfer its publishing rights for the Destiny
franchise to Bungie in exchange for cash and Bungie's assumption of on-going customer obligations of Activision. Going forward, Activision no longer has any material rights or obligations related to
the Destiny franchise. As a result of the agreement to terminate the relationship, the Company recognized net bookings, a key operating metric, of $20 million, GAAP revenues of
$164 million, and GAAP operating income of $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

(ii)   Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.

Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. ("Blizzard") is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content,
particularly for the PC platform. Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game
sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard
Battle.net

®

, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content and selected Activision content, online social connectivity, and the creation of
user-generated content. Blizzard also includes the activities of the Overwatch League

TM

, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, and our Major League
Gaming ("MLG") business, which is responsible for various esports events and serves as a multi-platform network for Activision Blizzard esports content.

Blizzard's
key product franchises include: World of Warcraft

®

, a subscription-based massive multi-player online role-playing game for the PC
platform; StarCraft

®

, a real-time strategy franchise for the PC platform; Diablo

®

, an action role-playing
franchise for the PC and console platforms; Hearthstone

®

, an online collectible card franchise for the PC and mobile platforms; and
Overwatch

®

, a team-based first-person shooter for the PC and console platforms.

(iii)  King Digital Entertainment

King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, primarily on mobile platforms, such as Google Inc.'s
("Google") Android and Apple Inc.'s ("Apple") iOS. King also distributes its content and services on the PC platform, primarily via Facebook. King's



games
are free to play; however, players can acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency or real currency, and we continue to focus on in-game advertising as a growing source of additional
revenue.

King's
key product franchises, all of which are for the mobile and PC platforms, include: Candy Crush™, which features "match three" games; Farm Heroes™, which
also features "match three" games; and Bubble Witch™, which features "bubble shooter" games. King had two of the top 10 highest-grossing titles in the U.S. mobile app stores for the last
21 quarters in a row, according to App Annie Intelligence and internal estimates for the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store combined.

Other

We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:

•

the Activision Blizzard Studios ("Studios") business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of
globally recognized intellectual properties, and which, in September 2018, released the third season of the animated TV series

Skylanders

™

Academy

on
Netflix; and

•

the Activision Blizzard Distribution ("Distribution") business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and
sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Products

We develop interactive entertainment content and services, principally for console, PC, and mobile devices, and we market and sell our games
through retail and digital distribution channels. Our products span various genres, including first-person shooter, action/adventure, role-playing, strategy, and "match three," among others. We
primarily offer the following products and services:

•

full-games, which typically provide access to main game content, primarily for console or PC;

•

downloadable content, which provides players with additional in-game content to purchase following the purchase of a full game;

•

microtransactions, which typically provide relatively small pieces of additional in-game content or enhancements to gameplay, generally at
relatively low price points; and

•

subscriptions for players in our World of Warcraft franchise that provide for continual access to the game content.

Providing
additional opportunities for player investment outside of full-game purchases has allowed us to shift from our historical seasonality to a more consistently recurring and
year-round revenue model. In addition, if executed properly, it allows us to increase player engagement, as it provides more frequent and incremental content for our players.

Product Development and Support

We focus on developing enduring franchises backed by well-designed, high-quality games with regular content updates. We build interactive
entertainment content with the potential for broad reach, sustainable engagement and year-round player investment. It is our experience that enduring franchises then serve as the basis for sequels,
prequels, and related new products and content that can be released over an extended period of time. We believe that the development and distribution of products and content based on established
franchises enhances predictability of revenues and the probability of high



unit
volume sales and operating profits. We intend to continue development of owned franchises in the future.

We
develop and produce our titles using a model in which a group of creative, technical, and production professionals, including designers, producers, programmers, artists, and sound
engineers, in coordination with our marketing, finance, analytics, sales, and other professionals, has responsibility for the entire development and production process, including the supervision and
coordination of internal and, where appropriate, external resources. We believe this model allows us to deploy the best resources for a given task, by supplementing our internal expertise with
top-quality external resources on an as-needed basis.

While
most of the content for our franchises is developed by internal studios, we periodically engage independent third-party developers to create content on our behalf. From time to
time, we also acquire the license rights to publish and/or distribute software products that are, or will be, independently created by third-party developers.

We
provide various forms of product support. Central technology and development teams review, assess, and provide support to products throughout the development process. Quality
assurance personnel are also involved throughout the development and production of published content. We subject all such content to extensive testing before public release to ensure compatibility
with appropriate hardware systems and configurations and to minimize the number of bugs and other defects found in the products. To support our content, we generally provide 24-hour game support to
players through various means, primarily online and by telephone.

Marketing, Sales, and Distribution

Many of our products contain software that enables us to connect with our gamers directly. This provides a significant marketing tool that
allows us to communicate and market directly to our customers, including through customized advertising and in-game messaging based on customer preferences and trends. Our marketing efforts also
include activities on Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, YouTube, and other online social networks, other online advertising, other public relations activity, print and broadcast advertising, coordinated
in-store and industry promotions (including merchandising and point of purchase displays), participation in cooperative advertising programs, direct response vehicles, and product sampling through
demonstration software distributed through the Internet or the digital online services provided by our partners. From time to time, we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers,
producers of consumer products related to a game, and retailers in connection with their own promotional efforts, as well as co-marketing from promotional partners.

Our
physical products are available for sale in outlets around the world. These products are sold primarily on a direct basis to mass-market retailers (e.g., Target, Walmart),
consumer electronics stores (e.g., Best Buy), discount warehouses, game specialty stores (e.g., GameStop), and other stores (e.g., Amazon), or through third-party distribution and
licensing arrangements.

Most
of our products and content are also available in a digital format, which allows consumers to purchase and download the content at their convenience directly to their console, PC,
or mobile device through our platform partners, including Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft"), Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. ("Sony"), Apple, Google, Nintendo Co., Ltd.
("Nintendo"), and Facebook. Blizzard utilizes its proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net, to distribute most of Blizzard's content and selected Activision content directly to PC
consumers.

In
addition to serving as a distribution platform, Blizzard Battle.net offers players communications features, social networking, player matching and digital content delivery and is
designed to allow people to connect regardless of which of our games on Blizzard Battle.net they are playing. It attracts millions of active players, making it one of the largest online game-related
services in the world.



Manufacturing

We prepare master program copies for our products on each release platform. With respect to products for Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo consoles,
our disk duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly, and shipping are performed by third-party subcontractors or distribution facilities owned by us.

Microsoft,
Sony, and Nintendo generally specify or control the manufacturing and assembly of finished products and license their hardware technologies to us. In return, we pay an
applicable royalty per unit once the manufacturer fills the product order, even if the units do not ultimately sell. We deliver the master materials to the licensor or its approved replicator, who
then manufactures the finished goods and delivers them to us for distribution under our label.

Significant Customers and Top Franchises

Customers

While the Company does sell directly to end consumers in certain instances, such as sales through Blizzard's proprietary online gaming service
platform, Blizzard Battle.net, in other instances our customers may be platform providers, such as Sony, Microsoft, Google, and Apple, or retailers, such as Walmart and GameStop, who act as
distributors of our content to end consumers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had three customers—Apple, Sony, and Google—who accounted for 15%, 13%, and 11%,
respectively, of net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had three customers—Apple, Sony, and Google—who accounted for 16%, 14%, and 10%, respectively, of
net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had two customers—Sony and Apple—who each accounted for 13% of net revenues. No other customer accounted for 10%
or more of our net revenues in the respective periods discussed above.

We
had two customers—Sony and NetEase, Inc.—who accounted for 15% and 12%, respectively, of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2018. We
had three customers—Sony, Microsoft, and Apple—who accounted for 17%, 14%, and 10%, respectively, of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2017. No other
customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated gross receivables in the respective periods discussed above.

Top Franchises

For the year ended December 31, 2018, our top three franchises—Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and World of
Warcraft—collectively accounted for 58% of our net revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our top four franchises—Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of
Warcraft, and Overwatch—collectively accounted for 66% and 69% of our net revenues, respectively. No other franchise comprised 10% or more of our net revenues in the respective periods
discussed above.

Competition

We compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other interactive entertainment companies, as well as with
providers of different forms of entertainment, such as film, television, social networking, music and other consumer products.

The
interactive entertainment industry is intensely competitive and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly introduced. We believe that the main
competitive factors in the interactive entertainment industry include: product features, game quality, and playability; brand name recognition; compatibility of products with popular platforms; access
to distribution channels; online capability and functionality; ease of use; price; marketing support; and quality of customer service.



We
compete with other publishers of video game console, PC, and mobile interactive entertainment software. In addition to third-party software competitors, integrated video game console
hardware and software companies, such as Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms. A number of software publishers
have developed and commercialized, or are currently developing, online games for use by consumers.

Intellectual Property

Like other interactive entertainment companies, our business is significantly dependent on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of
intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted software code, patented technology, and other technology and trade secrets that we use to develop and run our
games. Other intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted audio-visual elements that consumers can see, hear, and interact with when they are playing our games.

We
develop a majority of our products based on wholly-owned intellectual properties, such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, among others. In other cases, we obtain
intellectual property through licenses and service agreements. Further, our products that play on consoles and mobile platforms include technology that is owned by the platform provider and is
licensed non-exclusively to us for use in the relevant product. We also license technology from providers other than console manufacturers in developing our content and services. While we may have
renewal rights for some licenses, our business is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on reasonable terms and at reasonable
rates.

We
are actively engaged in enforcement of our copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret rights against potential infringers of those rights along with other protective activities,
including monitoring online channels for distribution of pirated copies and participating in various enforcement initiatives, education programs and legislative activity around the world. For our PC
products, we use technological protection measures to prevent piracy and the use of unauthorized copies of our products. For other platforms, the platform providers typically incorporate technological
protections and other security measures in their platforms to prevent the use of unlicensed products on those platforms.

Item 1A.    RISK FACTORS

We wish to caution the reader that the following important risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in
this report or in our other filings with the SEC, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document and elsewhere. These
risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Further, the risks described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently
known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition,
results of operations, income, revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, or stock price.

If we do not consistently deliver popular, high-quality content in a timely manner, or if consumers prefer
competing products, our business may be negatively impacted.

Consumer preferences for games are usually cyclical and difficult to predict, and even the most successful content remains popular for only
limited periods of time, unless refreshed with new content or otherwise enhanced. In order to remain competitive, we must continuously develop new products or enhancements to our existing products.
These products or enhancements may not be well-received by consumers, even if well-reviewed and of high quality. Further, competitors may develop content that imitates or competes with our
best-selling games, potentially taking sales away from them or reducing our ability to charge the same prices we have historically charged for our products. These competing products may take a larger
share of consumer spending than anticipated, which could cause product sales to fall below expectations. If we do not continue to develop consistently high-quality and well-received games, if our
marketing fails to resonate with our consumers, if consumers lose interest in a genre of games we produce, if the use of cross-promotion within our mobile games to retain consumers becomes less
effective, or if our competitors develop more successful products or offer competitive products at lower prices, our revenues and profit margins could decline. Further, a failure by us to develop a
high-quality product, or our development of a product that is otherwise not well-received, could potentially result in additional expenditures to respond to consumer demands, harm our reputation, and
increase the likelihood that our future products will not be well-received. The increased importance of downloadable content to our business amplifies these risks, as downloadable
content for poorly-received games typically generates lower-than-expected sales. In addition, our own best-selling products could compete with our other games, reducing sales for those other games.

Additionally,
consumer expectations regarding the quality, performance and integrity of our products and services are high. Consumers may be critical of our brands, games, services,
and/or business practices for a wide variety of reasons, and such negative reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to manage effectively. For example, if our games or services, such as
our proprietary online gaming service, do not function as consumers expect, whether because they fail to function as advertised or otherwise, our sales may suffer. The risk that this may occur is
particularly pronounced with respect to our games with online features because they involve ongoing consumer expectations, which we may not be able to consistently satisfy. Our games with online
features are also frequently updated, increasing the risk that a game may contain significant errors, or "bugs." If any of these issues occur, consumers may stop playing the game and may be less
likely to return to the game as often in the future, which may negatively impact our business.

Further,
delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could negatively impact our business and reputation and could cause our
results of operations to be materially different from expectations. If we fail to release our products in a timely manner, or if we are unable to continue to extend the life of existing games by
adding features and functionality that will encourage continued engagement with the game, our business may be negatively impacted.



Additionally,
the amount of lead time and cost involved in the development of high-quality products is increasing, and the longer the lead time involved in developing a product and the
greater the allocation of financial resources to such product, the more critical it is that we accurately predict consumer demand for such product. If our future products do not achieve expected
consumer acceptance or generate sufficient revenues upon introduction, we may not be able to recover the substantial up-front development and marketing costs associated with those products.

We depend on a relatively small number of franchises for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.

We follow a franchise model and a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from products based on a relatively small
number of popular franchises. These products are responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, revenues associated with the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and World of
Warcraft franchises, collectively, accounted for approximately 58% of our net revenues—and a significantly higher
percentage of our operating income—for 2018. We expect that a relatively limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our revenues
and profits. Due to this dependence on a limited number of franchises, the failure to achieve anticipated results by one or more products based on these franchises could negatively impact our
business. Additionally, if the popularity of a franchise declines, we may have to write off the unrecovered portion of the underlying intellectual property assets, which could negatively impact our
business.

We may be unable to effectively manage the continued growth in the scope and complexity of our business,
including our expansion into new business models that are untested and into adjacent business opportunities with large, established competitors.

We have experienced significant growth in the scope and complexity of our business, including through the King Acquisition and the development
of our esports, advertising, Studios, and consumer products businesses, and remain ambitious as to the future growth in the scope and complexity of our business. Our future success depends, in part,
on our ability to manage this expanded business and our aspirations for continued expansion. We have dedicated resources both to new business models that are largely untested, as is the case with
esports, and to adjacent business opportunities in which very large competitors have an established presence, as is the case with our Studios and consumer products businesses. We do not know to what
extent our future expansions will be successful. Further, even if successful, the growth of our business could create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources,
and could increase existing strain on, and divert focus from, our core businesses. If not managed effectively, this growth could result in the over-extension of our operating infrastructure, and our
management systems, information technology systems, and internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support this growth. Failure to adequately manage our growth in any of these ways may
cause damage to our brand or otherwise negatively impact our business. Further, any failure by these new businesses may damage our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our core business of
interactive software products and entertainment content. Conversely, the success of these new businesses is, in large part, contingent on the success of the underlying franchises and, as such, a
decline in the popularity of a franchise may impact the success of the new businesses adjacent to that franchise.

We may not realize the expected financial and operational benefits of our recently announced restructuring
plan, and its implementation may negatively impact our business.

In February 2019, we announced a restructuring plan under which we plan to refocus our resources on our largest opportunities and to remove
unnecessary levels of complexity and duplication from certain parts of our business. While we believe this restructuring plan will enable us to provide better opportunities for talent, and greater
expertise and scale on behalf of our business units, our ability to



achieve
the desired and anticipated benefits from the restructuring plan within our desired and expected timeframe is subject to many estimates and assumptions, and the actual savings and timing for
those savings may vary materially based on factors such as local labor regulations, negotiations with third parties, and operational requirements. These estimates and assumptions are also subject to
significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Further, there can be no assurance that our business will be more efficient or effective than prior to
implementation of the plan, or that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future. The implementation of this restructuring plan may also be costly and disruptive to
our business or have other negative consequences, such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce or negative impacts on employee morale and productivity, or on our ability to attract and
retain highly skilled employees. Any of these consequences could negatively impact our business.

The increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model,
including greater competition.

The proportion of our revenues derived from digital distributional channels, as compared to traditional retail sales, continues to increase. The
increased importance of digital channels in our industry increases our potential competition, as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game, particularly a new game
for mobile platforms, may be significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution and is played on a game console or PC. Also, while
digitally-distributed products generally have higher profit margins than retail sales, as business shifts to digital distribution, the volume of orders from retailers for physical discs has been, and
may continue to be, reduced. Further, the providers of the platforms through which we digitally distribute content are also publishers of their own content distributed on those platforms, and,
therefore, a platform provider may give priority to its own products or those of our competitors.

The importance of retail sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model.

While the proportion of our revenues derived from digital distributional channels, as compared to traditional retail sales, continues to
increase, retail sales remain important to our business. In the United States and Canada, our "boxed" products are often sold on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores,
discount warehouses and game specialty stores. Our "boxed" products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements, and through our
wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries. Our sales are
made primarily on a purchase order basis without long-term agreements or other forms of commitments, and, due to the increased proportion of our revenue from digital distribution channels, our retail
customers and distributors have generally been reducing the levels of inventory they are willing to carry. The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any of Activision's principal retail
customers or distributors could have adverse consequences.

Moreover,
the importance of retail sales to our business exposes us to the risk of product returns and price protection with respect to our distributors and retailers. In some cases,
return policies allow distributors and retailers to return defective, shelf-worn, damaged, and certain other products in accordance with terms granted. Price protection, when granted and applicable,
allows these distributors and retailers a credit against amounts owed with respect to merchandise unsold by them. We may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, distributors and
retail customers who meet certain conditions. These conditions may include compliance with applicable payment terms, delivery of weekly inventory and sales information and consistent participation in
the launches of premium title releases. We may also consider other factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other industry factors. Activision also offers a limited warranty to
end users that Activision products will be free from manufacturing defects. Although we maintain a reserve for returns and price protection, and although we may place limits on product returns and
price protection, we could be



forced
to accept substantial product returns and provide substantial price protection to maintain our relationships with retailers and our access to distribution channels. We face similar issues and
risks, including exposure to risk of chargebacks, with respect to end users to whom we sell products directly, whether through our proprietary online gaming service or otherwise.

Further,
retailers typically have a limited amount of "brick and mortar" shelf space and promotional resources, and there is intense competition for high-quality retail shelf space and
promotional support from retailers. Similarly, for online retail sales, there is increasing competition for premium placements on websites. Competition for shelf space or premium online placement may
intensify and may require us to increase our marketing expenditures. Further, retailers with limited shelf space typically devote the most and highest quality shelf space to those products expected to
be best sellers. We cannot be certain that our new products will consistently achieve such "best seller" status. Due to increased competition for limited shelf space, retailers and distributors are in
an increasingly better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale, including price discounts, price protection, marketing and display fees, and product return policies. Our products constitute a
relatively small percentage of most retailers' sales volume. We cannot be certain that retailers will continue to purchase our products or provide those products with adequate levels of shelf space
and promotional support on acceptable terms.

Additionally,
we make provisions for retail inventory price protection based upon certain assumed lowest prices and if competitive pressures force us to lower our prices below those
levels, it could
similarly have a negative impact on our business. Further, because we pay a licensing fee to the console hardware manufacturer for each physical copy of a product manufactured for that manufacturer's
game platform regardless of whether that product is actually sold, if we overestimate demand and make too many physical "boxed" copies of any title, we will incur unrecoverable manufacturing costs for
unsold units.

Due to our reliance on third-party platforms, platform providers are frequently able to influence our
products and costs.

Generally, when we develop interactive entertainment software products for hardware platforms offered by companies such as Sony, Microsoft, or
Nintendo, the physical products are replicated exclusively by that hardware manufacturer or their approved replicator. The agreements with these manufacturers include certain provisions, such as
approval rights over all software products and related promotional materials and the ability to change the fee they charge for the manufacturing of products, which allow the hardware manufacturers
substantial influence over the cost and the release schedule of such interactive entertainment software products. In addition, because each of the manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its
own hardware platforms and may manufacture products for other licensees, a manufacturer may give priority to its own products or those of our competitors. Accordingly, console manufacturers like Sony,
Microsoft, or Nintendo could cause unanticipated delays in the release of our products, as well as increases to projected development, manufacturing, marketing or distribution costs, any of which
could negatively impact our business.

The
platform providers also control the networks over which consumers purchase digital products and services for their platforms and through which we provide online game capabilities for
our products. The control that the platform providers have over the fee structures and/or retail pricing for products and services for their platforms and online networks could impact the volume of
purchases of our products made over their networks and our profitability. With respect to certain downloadable content and microtransactions, the networks provided by these platform providers are the
exclusive means of selling and distributing this content. Further, increased competition for limited premium "digital shelf space" has placed the platform providers in an increasingly better position
to negotiate favorable terms of sale. If the platform provider establishes terms that restrict our offerings on its platform, significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or
services are offered, or



does
not approve the inclusion of online capabilities in our console products, our business could be negatively impacted.

We
also derive significant revenues from the distribution on third-party mobile and web platforms, such as the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook, and most of the
virtual currency we sell is purchased using the payment processing systems of these platform providers. These platforms also serve as significant online distribution platforms for, and/or provide
other services critical for the operation of, a number of our games. If these platforms modify their current discovery mechanisms, communication channels available to developers, operating systems,
terms of service or other policies (including fees), or they develop their own competitive offerings, our business could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if these platform providers are required
to change how they label free-to-play games or take payment for in-app purchases or change how the personal information of consumers is made available to developers, our business could be negatively
impacted. These platform providers or their services may be unavailable for short periods of time or experience issues with their in-app purchasing functionality. If either of these events occurs on a
prolonged, or even short-term, basis or other similar issues arise that impact players' ability to access our games, access social features or make purchases, it may result in lost revenues and
otherwise negatively impact our business.

Our business is highly dependent on the success and availability of video game consoles manufactured by third
parties, as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these consoles.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of products for play on video game consoles manufactured by third parties, such as
Sony's PS4, Microsoft's Xbox One, and Nintendo's Switch. For example, sales of products for consoles accounted for 34% of our consolidated net revenues in 2018. The success of our console business is
driven in large part by our ability to accurately predict which consoles will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these consoles. We also
rely on the availability of an adequate supply of these video game consoles and the continued support for these consoles by their manufacturers. We must make product development decisions and commit
significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new console, and development costs to create content for new consoles may be greater than those costs for the then-current
consoles. If increased costs are not offset by higher revenues and other cost efficiencies, our business could be negatively impacted. If the consoles for which we develop new software products or
modify existing products do not attain significant consumer acceptance, we may not be able to recover our development costs, which could be significant.

The increasing importance of free-to-play games to our business exposes us to the risks of that business
model, including the dependence on a relatively small number of consumers for a significant portion of revenues and profits from any given game.

As a result of, among other things, the King Acquisition, we are more dependent on our ability to develop, enhance, and monetize free-to-play
games, such as the games in our Candy Crush franchise and

Hearthstone.

As such, we are increasingly exposed to the risks of the free-to-play business
model. For example, we may invest in the development of new free-to-play interactive entertainment products that do not achieve significant commercial success, in which case our revenues
from those products likely will be lower than anticipated and we may not recover our development costs. Further, if: (1) we are unable to continue to offer free-to-play games that encourage
consumers to purchase our virtual currency and subsequently use it to buy our virtual items; (2) we fail to offer monetization features that appeal to these consumers; (3) these
consumers do not continue to play our free-to-play games or purchase virtual items at the same rate; (4) our platform providers make it more difficult or expensive for players to purchase our
virtual currency; or (5) we cannot encourage significant additional consumers to purchase virtual items in our free-to-play games, our business may be negatively impacted.



Furthermore,
as there are relatively low barriers to entry to developing mobile or online free-to-play or other casual games, we have seen, and expect to continue to see new competitors
enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to developing and marketing competing games and applications. We compete, or may compete, with a vast number of small companies and
individuals who are able to create and launch casual games and other content using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. Competition for the attention of
consumers on mobile devices is intense, as the number of applications on mobile devices has been increasing dramatically, which, in turn, has required increased marketing to garner consumer awareness
and attention. This increased competition has negatively impacted, and is expected to continue to negatively impact our business. In addition, a continuing industry shift to free-to-play games could
result in a deprioritization of our other products by traditional retailers and distributors.

We may be involved in legal proceedings that have a negative impact on our business.

From time to time, we are involved in claims, suits, investigations, audits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business,
including with respect to intellectual property, competition and antitrust matters, regulatory matters, tax matters, privacy matters, labor and employment matters, compliance matters, unclaimed
property matters, liability and personal injury claims, product damage claims, collection matters, and/or commercial claims. In addition, negative consumer sentiment about our business practices may
result in inquiries or investigations from regulatory agencies and consumer groups, as well as litigation, which, regardless of their outcome, may be damaging to our reputation.

Claims,
suits, investigations, audits, and proceedings are inherently difficult to predict and their results are subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are outside of our
control. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have a negative impact on us due to legal costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a
resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm, substantial settlements, judgments, fines or
penalties, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products or services, requiring us to change our development process or other
business practices.

There
is also inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for these matters. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of these matters, including assessing the probability
of potential outcomes and determining whether a potential exposure can be reasonably estimated. In making these determinations, we, in consultation with outside counsel, examine the relevant facts and
circumstances on a quarterly basis assuming, as applicable, a combination of settlement and litigated outcomes and strategies. Further, it may take time to develop factors on which reasonable
judgments and estimates can be based. If we fail to establish appropriate reserves, our business could be negatively impacted.

Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact our business.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and
calculations where the ultimate income tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. Although we believe our income tax estimates
are reasonable, the ultimate outcomes may have a negative impact on our business.

Our
income tax liability and effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business, the mix of earnings in countries with differing
statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws or tax rulings, changes in interpretations of existing laws, or developments in tax examinations or investigations. Any of these factors could have a negative
impact on our business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. The tax regimes we are subject to, or operate under, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change.
A number of countries are



actively
pursuing fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to multinational companies like us. Furthermore, tax authorities may choose to examine or investigate our tax reporting or tax
liability, including under transfer pricing or permanent establishment theories. These proceedings may lead to adjustments or proposed adjustments to our income taxes or provisions for uncertain tax
positions.

On
December 22, 2017, tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "U.S. Tax Reform Act") was enacted in the United States. The U.S. Tax Reform Act introduced
significant
changes to U.S. income tax law that have had a meaningful impact on our financial position and effective tax rate. Accounting for the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act and subsequent
guidance issued required complex new calculations to be performed and significant judgments in interpreting the legislation. Additional guidance may be issued on how the provisions of the U.S. Tax
Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation, which could result in adjustments to the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act we have recorded
at December 31, 2018. These adjustments could have a negative impact on our business.

In
December 2017, we received a Notice of Reassessment from the French Tax Authority ("FTA") related to transfer pricing for intercompany transactions involving one of our French
subsidiaries for the 2011 through 2013 tax years. We disagree with the proposed assessment and intend to vigorously contest it. We plan to pursue all remedies available to us to successfully resolve
this matter, including administrative remedies with the FTA, and, if necessary, judicial remedies. While we believe our tax provisions at December 31, 2018, are appropriate, until such time as
this matter is ultimately resolved we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition to the risk of additional tax for the 2011 through 2013 tax years, if litigation regarding
this matter were adversely determined and/or if the FTA were to seek adjustments of a similar nature for subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.

In
December 2018, we received a decision from the Swedish Tax Agency ("STA") informing us of an audit assessment to a Swedish subsidiary of King for the 2016 tax year. We disagree with
the STA's decision and intend to vigorously contest it. We plan to pursue all remedies available to us to successfully resolve the matter, including administrative remedies with the STA, multilateral
procedures with other relevant taxing jurisdictions, and, if necessary, judicial remedies. Further, we may be required to pay the full assessment to the STA in advance of the final resolution of the
matter. While we believe our tax provisions at December 31, 2018, are appropriate, until such time as this matter is ultimately resolved we could be subject to significant additional tax
liabilities.

We
are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and
various other jurisdictions. Tax authorities regularly examine these non-income taxes. The outcomes from these examinations, changes in the business, changes in applicable tax rules or other tax
matters may have a negative impact on our business.

Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate
our resources among, emerging technologies and business models, our business may be negatively impacted.

Technology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry. We must continually anticipate and adapt our products, distribution
channels, and business models to emerging technologies and delivery platforms to stay competitive. Forecasting our revenues and profitability for these new products, distribution channels and business
models is inherently uncertain and volatile, and if we invest in the development of interactive entertainment products or distribution channels
incorporating a new technology or for a new platform that does not achieve significant commercial success, whether because of competition or otherwise, we may not recover the often substantial "up
front" costs of developing and marketing those products and distribution channels, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other products or
distribution channels. Further, our competitors may adapt to an emerging technology or business model more quickly or effectively than we do, creating products that are technologically superior to
ours, more appealing to consumers, or both.



If, on the other hand, we elect not to pursue the development of products incorporating a new technology or for new platforms, or otherwise elect not to pursue
new business models, that achieve significant commercial success, it may have adverse consequences. It may take significant time and expenditures to shift product development resources to that
technology, platform or business model, as the case may be, and it may be more difficult to compete against existing products incorporating that technology or for that platform or against companies
using that business model.

Competition within, and to, the interactive entertainment industry is intense, and competitors may succeed in
reducing our sales.

We compete with other publishers of interactive entertainment software, both within and outside the United States. Our competitors include very
large corporations with significantly greater financial, marketing and product development resources than we have. Our larger competitors may be able to leverage their greater financial, technical,
personnel and other resources to provide larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for
commercially desirable properties, as well as adopt more aggressive pricing policies to develop more commercially successful video game products than we do. In addition, competitors with large
portfolios and popular games typically have greater influence with platform providers, retailers, distributors and other customers who may, in turn, provide more favorable support to those
competitors' games.

Additionally,
we compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities. As our business continues to expand in complexity and scope, we have increased exposure to additional
competitors, including those with access to large existing user bases and control over distribution channels. Further, it is difficult to predict and prepare for rapid changes in consumer demand that
could materially alter public preferences for different forms of entertainment and leisure activities. Failure to adequately identify and adapt to these competitive pressures could negatively impact
our business.

If we are unable to sell our products at the prices we planned to, our business may be negatively impacted.

If we are unable to sell our products at the prices we planned, whether due to competitive pressure, including the continuing industry shift to
free-to-play games, because retailers or other third parties elect to price these products at a lower price, or otherwise, it has, and is expected to continue to have, a negative impact on our
business. Further, our decisions around the development of new game content are grounded in assumptions about eventual pricing levels. If there is price compression in the market after these decisions
are made, it could have a negative impact on our business.

If we do not continue to attract, retain, and motivate skilled personnel, we will be unable to effectively
conduct our business.

Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify, attract, hire, retain, motivate, and utilize the abilities of qualified
personnel, particularly personnel with the specialized skills needed to create and sell the high-quality, well-received content upon which our business is substantially dependent. Our industry is
generally characterized by a high level of employee mobility, competitive compensation programs, and aggressive recruiting among competitors for employees with technical, marketing, sales,
engineering, product development, creative, and/or management skills. We may have difficulties in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or may incur significant costs to do so. If we are unable
to attract additional qualified employees or retain and utilize the services of key personnel, it could have a negative impact on our business.



We rely on external developers to develop some of our software products.

We rely on external software developers to develop some of our software products. Because we depend on these developers, we are subject to the
following risks:

•

continuing strong demand for top-tier developers' resources, combined with the recognition they receive in connection with their work, may
cause developers who worked for us in the past either to work for a competitor in the future or to renegotiate agreements with us on terms less favorable to us;

•

limited financial resources and business expertise or the inability to retain skilled personnel may force developers out of business prior to
completing products for us or require us to fund additional costs;

•

a competitor may acquire the business of one or more key developers or sign them to exclusive development arrangements and, in either case, we
would not be able to continue to engage such developers' services for our products, except for any period for which the developer is contractually obligated to complete development for us; and

•

reliance on external developers reduces our visibility into, and control over, development schedules and operational outcomes compared to those
when utilizing internal development resources.

We engage in strategic transactions and may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses or
otherwise realizing the anticipated benefits of these transactions.

As part of our business strategy, from time to time, we acquire, make investments in, or enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures with,
complementary businesses. These transactions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: (1) in the case of an acquisition, (i) the potential for the acquired business to
underperform relative to our expectations and the acquisition price, (ii) the potential for the acquired business to cause our financial results to differ from expectations in any given period,
or over the longer-term, (iii) unexpected tax consequences from the acquisition, or the tax treatment of the acquired business's operations going forward, giving rise to incremental tax
liabilities that are difficult to predict, (iv) difficulty in integrating the acquired business, its operations, and its employees in an efficient and effective manner, (v) any unknown
liabilities or internal control deficiencies assumed as part of the acquisition, and (vi) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses; and (2) in the case of an
investment, alliance, or joint venture, (i) our ability to cooperate with our partner, (ii) our partner having economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with
ours, and (iii) the potential that our partner may be unable to meet its economic or other obligations, which may require us to fulfill those obligations alone. Further, any such transaction
may involve the risk that our senior management's attention will be excessively diverted from our other operations, the risk that our industry does not evolve as anticipated, and that any intellectual
property or personnel skills acquired do not prove to be those needed for our future success, and the risk that our strategic objectives, cost savings or other anticipated benefits are otherwise not
achieved.

Our debt could adversely affect our business.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $2.7 billion of long-term debt outstanding. Our debt burden could have
important consequences, including: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business
and our industry; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flows from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability
of cash flow to fund our operations, growth strategy,



working
capital, capital expenditures, future business opportunities, and other general corporate purposes; restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic
divestitures; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; limiting
our ability to
adjust to changing market conditions; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors who have lower levels of debt. Further, though our current long-term debt all bears fixed
interest rates, if and when we have borrowings at floating rates of interest, it could expose us to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to those borrowings.

Agreements
governing our indebtedness, including our credit agreement entered into on October 11, 2013 (as amended thereafter and from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") and
the indentures governing our notes, impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios. In
addition, under certain circumstances, the Credit Agreement and our indentures may limit or prohibit other activities. In addition, we are required to maintain a maximum total net debt ratio
calculated pursuant to a financial maintenance covenant under the Credit Agreement. Further, various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these
covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Such
a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our
obligations, including our obligations under the Credit Agreement or the indentures governing our notes. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional
debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. There can be no assurances that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if, for
any reason, we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

We may not be able to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility if we are not able to meet the
conditions to borrowing under that facility.

We view our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility as a source of available liquidity. This facility contains various conditions,
covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds. We have not borrowed under the revolving credit facility to date, but if we wish to do so, there can be no
assurance that we will be in compliance with these conditions, covenants and representations at such time.

The LIBOR calculation method may change and LIBOR is expected to be phased out after 2021.

Interest on our revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to mature in 2023, is calculated based on LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the U.K.
Financial Conduct Authority (the "FCA") announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In the meantime, actions by the FCA, other regulators,
or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the method by which LIBOR is calculated. At this time, it is not possible to predict the
effect of any such changes or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the U.K. or elsewhere on our revolving credit facility.

Lawsuits have been filed, and may continue to be filed, against publishers of interactive entertainment
software products.

In prior years, lawsuits have been filed against numerous interactive entertainment companies, including against us, by the families of victims
of violence, alleging that interactive entertainment products influence the behavior of the perpetrators of such violence. These lawsuits have been dismissed, but similar additional lawsuits could be
filed in the future. Although our general liability



insurance
carrier has agreed to defend lawsuits of this nature with respect to the prior lawsuits, it is uncertain whether insurance carriers would do so in the future, or if such insurance carriers
would cover all or any amounts for which we might be liable if such future lawsuits are not decided in our favor. Further, any such lawsuit could result in increased governmental scrutiny, harm to our
reputation, reduced demand by consumers for our products, or decreased willingness by our customers to purchase, or by our partners to provide marketing support for, those products. Such results could
divert development and management resources, increase legal fees and other costs, and have other negative impacts on our business.

We are exposed to seasonality in the sale of our products.

The interactive entertainment industry is somewhat seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the calendar year-end
holiday buying season. As a result, our sales have historically been highest during the fourth quarter of the year, particularly for our Activision segment. Receivables and credit risk are likewise
higher during the fourth quarter of the year, as retailers increase their purchases of our products in anticipation of the holiday season. Delays in development, approvals or manufacturing could
affect the timing of the release of products, causing us to miss key selling periods such as the year-end holiday buying season, which could negatively impact our business.

Our business may be harmed if our distributors, retailers, development and licensing partners, or other third
parties with whom we do business act in ways that put our brand at risk.

In many cases, our business partners are given access to sensitive and proprietary information or control over our intellectual property to
provide services and support to our team. These third parties may misappropriate our information or intellectual property and engage in unauthorized use of it or otherwise act in a way that places our
brand at risk. The failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies, the failure of third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies, or the
misappropriation or misuse of this information or intellectual property could result in a disruption to our business operations or an adverse effect on our reputation and may negatively impact our
business.

We use open source software in connection with certain of our games and services, which may pose particular
risks to our proprietary software, products, and services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business.

We use open source software in connection with some of the games and services we offer. Some open source software licenses require users who
distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on
unfavorable terms or at no cost. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes
unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software. Were it determined that our use was not in compliance with a particular license, we may be required to release our
proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our games or products, discontinue distribution in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or take
other remedial action that may divert resources away from our game development efforts, any of which could negatively impact our business.

We may be subject to intellectual property claims.

As the number of interactive entertainment software products increases and the features and content of these products continue to overlap,
software developers have increasingly become subject to infringement claims. Further, many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on real-world things or people,
which may also be the subject of claims of infringement of the



intellectual
property of others, including right of publicity, trademark, and unfair competition claims. In addition, our products often utilize complex, cutting-edge technology that may become
subject to emerging intellectual property claims of others. Although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others, third parties may still claim infringement,
particularly since there are many companies that focus exclusively on enforcing patent rights.

From
time to time, we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether meritorious or not, may be time
consuming, distracting to management, and expensive to defend. Further, intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the
following:

•

cease selling, incorporating, supporting, or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;

•

obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which, if available at all, may not be available on commercially
favorable terms;

•

redesign the affected interactive entertainment software products, which could result in additional costs, delay introduction and possibly
reduce commercial appeal of the affected products; or

•

pay damages to the holder of the infringed intellectual property for past infringements.

Our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying, and inadequate intellectual
property laws and other protections could prevent us from enforcing or defending our proprietary technologies. Further, the use of unauthorized "cheat" programs or the use of other unauthorized
software modifications by users could impact multiplayer gameplay or lead to reductions in microtransactions in our games.

We regard our software as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret
laws and employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary rights. We own or license various copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. The process of registering
and protecting these rights in various jurisdictions is expensive and time-consuming. Further, we are aware that some unauthorized copying occurs, and if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized
copying of our software products were to occur, it could negatively impact our business.

Piracy
is a persistent problem for us, and policing the unauthorized sale, distribution and use of our products is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. Further, the laws of some
countries in which our products are, or may be, distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or are poorly
enforced. In addition, though we take steps to make the unauthorized sale, distribution and use of our products more difficult and to enforce and police our rights, as do the manufacturers of consoles
and the operators of other platforms on which many of our games are played, these efforts may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products in all instances. Technology designed to
circumvent the protection measures used by console manufacturers and platform operators or by us in our products, the refusal of Internet service providers to remove infringing content in certain
instances and the ability to download pirated copies of games from various Internet sites and peer-to-peer networks could result in an expansion in piracy.

In
addition, "cheating" programs or other unauthorized software tools and modifications that enable consumers to cheat in games could negatively impact the volume of microtransactions or
purchases of downloadable content. In addition, vulnerabilities in the design of our products or the platforms upon which they run could be discovered after their release, which may result in lost
revenues from paying consumers or increased cost of developing technological measures to respond to these, either of which could negatively impact our business.

We
also cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in connection with emerging technologies.



The insolvency or business failure of any of our business partners could negatively impact us.

Our sales, whether digital or retail, are concentrated in a small number of large customers. This makes us more vulnerable to collection risk if
one or more of these large customers becomes unable to pay for our products or seeks protection under the bankruptcy laws. Retailers and distributors in the interactive entertainment industry have
from time to time experienced significant fluctuations in their businesses and a number of them have failed. Challenging economic conditions may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products
they have purchased and, as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-off of accounts receivable could increase and, even if increased, may turn out to be insufficient. Moreover, even in
cases where we have insurance to protect against a customer's bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation, this insurance typically contains a significant deductible and co-payment obligation and does not
cover all instances of non-payment. Further, the insolvency or business failure of other types of business partners could result in disruptions to the manufacturing or distribution of our products or
the cancellation of contractual arrangements that we consider to be favorable. A payment default by, or the insolvency or business failure of, a significant business partner could negatively impact
our business. In addition, having such a large portion of our
total net revenues concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers.

We are a global company and are subject to the risks and uncertainties of conducting business outside the
U.S.

We conduct business throughout the world, and we derive a substantial amount of our revenues and profits from international trade, particularly
from Europe, Asia, and Australia. Moving forward, we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues and profits and, moreover, that sales in
emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere will be an increasingly important part of our international sales. As such, we are, and may be increasingly, subject to risks inherent in foreign trade
generally, as well as risks inherent in doing business in emerging markets, including increased tariffs and duties, compliance with economic sanctions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates,
shipping delays, increases in transportation costs, international political, regulatory and economic developments, unexpected changes to laws, regulatory requirements, and enforcement on us and our
platform partners and differing local business practices, all of which may impact profit margins or make it more difficult, if not impossible, for us to conduct business in foreign markets.

A
deterioration in relations between either us or the United States and any country in which we have significant operations or sales, or the implementation of government regulations in
such a country, could result in the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including economic sanctions, that could have a negative impact on our business. For instance, to operate in China, all
games must have regulatory approval. A decision by the Chinese government to revoke its approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in China in the future
could have a negative impact on our business. Additionally, in the past, legislation has been implemented in China that has required modifications to our products. The future implementation of similar
laws or regulations in China or any other country in which we have operations or sales may restrict or prohibit the sale of our products or may require engineering modifications to our products that
are not cost-effective, if even feasible at all, or could degrade the consumer experience to the point where consumers cease to purchase such products. The Chinese game approval procedure was
suspended from March 2018 until January 2019 and, due to the large number of pending applications, it remains uncertain as to if and when our new products will be approved for release in China.
Further, the enforcement of regulations relating to mobile and other games with an online element in China remains uncertain, and further changes, either in the regulations or their enforcement, could
have a negative impact on our business in China.

We
are also subject to risks that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our employees, contractors, third-party partners, representatives, or agents in ways that
violate the



Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act or other similar anti-bribery laws, as well as the 2017 U.K. Criminal Finances Act or other similar financial crime laws. While we have
policies and procedures, as well as training for our employees, intended to secure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, third-party partners, representatives, or agents may take
actions that violate our policies. Moreover, it may be more difficult to oversee the conduct of any such persons who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions.

In
addition, cultural differences may affect consumer preferences and limit the international popularity of games that are popular in the U.S. or require us to modify the content of the
games or the method by which we charge our customers for the games to be successful. If we do not correctly assess consumer preferences in the countries in which we sell our products, or if the other
risks discussed herein come to fruition, it could negatively impact our business.

Additionally,
in June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the European Union (the "E.U."), commonly referred to as "Brexit." The United
Kingdom commenced withdrawal proceedings with the E.U. in March 2017, and, on March 29, 2019, is scheduled to leave the E.U. These withdrawal proceedings have created political and economic
uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the E.U., and this uncertainty may persist for years. The uncertainty surrounding the terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal and its consequences
could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the level of sales of discretionary items, including our products. The terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal could negatively impact
global financial markets, including currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could have a negative impact on our business, our suppliers and business partners, or our lenders and financial
counterparties. Further, the terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal and its consequences could potentially cause adverse disruptions to our operations, including our workforce, or the workforce of
our suppliers, business partners, lenders or financial counterparties, in the United Kingdom or the E.U. as a result of potential changes to applicable employment or immigration rules, and our systems
and information technology infrastructure or that of our suppliers, business partners, lenders or financial counterparties as a result of potential changes to regulations for data security or other
data protection rules. Given our extensive global operations, the potential widespread impacts triggered through Brexit could adversely affect our business.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively impact our business.

We transact business in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar and have significant international sales and expenses denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar, subjecting us to currency exchange rate risks. A substantial portion of our international sales and expenses are denominated in local currencies, including
euros, British pounds, Australian dollars, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, and Swedish krona, which could fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. Since we
have significant international sales but incur the majority of our costs in the United States, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may have
an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business. We have, in the past, utilized currency derivative contracts to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures and managed these exposures with
natural offsets. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue our hedging programs, or that we will be successful in managing exposure to currency exchange rate risks whether or not we do
so.

Our games are subject to scrutiny regarding the appropriateness of their content. If we fail to receive our
target ratings for certain titles, or if our retailers refuse to sell such titles due to what they perceive to be objectionable content, it could have a negative impact on our business.

Our console and PC games are subject to ratings by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (the "ESRB"), a self-regulatory body based in the
U.S. that provides U.S. and Canadian consumers of interactive entertainment software with ratings information, including information on the content in



such
software, such as violence, nudity, or sexual content, along with an assessment of the suitability of the content for certain age groups. Certain other countries have also established content
rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. In addition, certain stores use other ratings systems, such as Apple's use of its proprietary "App Rating System" and Google
Play's use of the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) rating system. If we are unable to obtain the ratings we have targeted for our products, it could have a negative impact on our business. In
some instances, we may be required to modify our products to meet the requirements of the rating systems, which could delay or disrupt the release of any given product, or may prevent its sale
altogether in certain territories. Further, if one of our games is "re-rated" for any reason, a ratings organization could require corrective actions, which could include a recall, retailers could
refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold or returned copies or consumers could demand a refund for copies previously purchased.

Additionally,
retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they
deem inappropriate for their businesses, whether because a product received a certain rating by the ESRB or other content rating system, or otherwise. If retailers decline to sell our products based
upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes, graphic violence or sexually explicit material, or other generally objectionable content, we might be required to modify particular titles or
forfeit the revenue opportunity of selling such titles with that retailer.

Further,
throughout the history of the interactive entertainment industry, many interactive software products have included hidden content and/or hidden gameplay features, some of which
have been accessible through the use of in-game codes or other technological means, that are intended to enhance the gameplay experience. In some cases, such undisclosed content or features have been
considered to be objectionable. While publishers are required to disclose pertinent hidden content during the ESRB ratings process, in a few cases, publishers have failed to disclose hidden content,
and the ESRB has required the recall of the game, changed the rating or associated content descriptors originally assigned to the product, required the publisher to change the game or game packaging
and/or imposed fines on the publisher. Retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of such undisclosed content by removing these games from their shelves, refusing to sell them, and demanding
that their publishers accept them as product returns. Likewise, some consumers have reacted to the revelation of undisclosed content by refusing to purchase such games, demanding refunds for games
they have already purchased, refraining from buying other games published by the company whose game contained the objectionable material, and, on at least one occasion, filing a lawsuit against the
publisher of the product containing such content.

We
have implemented preventive measures designed to reduce the possibility of objectionable undisclosed content from appearing in the interactive software products we publish.
Nonetheless, these preventive measures are subject to human error, circumvention, overriding, and reasonable resource constraints. If an interactive software product we publish is found to contain
undisclosed content, we could be subject to any of these consequences.

Our results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of objectionable third party-created
content.

Certain of our games support collaborative online features that allow consumers to post narrative comments, in real time, that are visible to
other consumers. Additionally, certain of our games allow consumers to create and share "user-generated content" that is visible to other consumers. From time to time, objectionable and offensive
consumer content may be distributed within our games through these features or to gaming websites or forums that allow consumers to post comments. Additionally, we have begun to generate revenue
through offering advertising within certain of our franchises. The content of in-game advertisements is generally created and delivered by third-party advertisers without our pre-approval, and, as
such, objectionable content may be published in our games by these



advertisers.
This objectionable third party-created content may expose us to regulatory action or claims related to content, or otherwise negatively impact our business.

Our business, products, and distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories. If we do
not successfully respond to these regulations, our business could be negatively impacted.

The video game industry continues to evolve, and new and innovative business opportunities are often subject to new attempts at regulation. As
such, legislation is continually being introduced, and litigation and regulatory enforcement actions are taking place, that may affect the way in which we, and other industry participants, may offer
content and features, and distribute and advertise our products. These laws, regulations, and investigations are related to protection of minors, gambling, consumer privacy, accessibility,
advertising, taxation, payments, intellectual property, distribution, and antitrust, among others.

For
example, many foreign countries have laws that permit governmental entities to restrict or prohibit marketing or distribution of interactive entertainment software products because
of the content therein (and similar legislation has been introduced at one time or another at the federal and state levels in the United States, including legislation that attempts to impose
additional taxes based on content). In addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that restrict or prohibit marketing or distribution of interactive entertainment software products with random digital
item mechanics, which some of our online games and services include, or subject to such products to additional regulation and oversight, such as reporting to regulators. Also, although we have
structured and operate our skill tournaments with applicable laws in mind, including any applicable laws relating to gambling, and believe that playing these games does not constitute gambling, our
skill tournaments could in the future become subject to gambling-related rules and regulations and expose us to civil and criminal penalties. We also sometimes offer consumers of our online and casual
games various types of contests and promotional opportunities. We are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of tournaments and games, many of which are
still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. Further, the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual items and currency may prompt calls for more
stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens or limitations on operations of companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices. Also, existing
laws or new laws regarding the marketing of in-app purchases, regulation of currency, banking institutions, unclaimed property, and money laundering may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or
goods. Further, in 2018, gaming addiction was listed as a mental health condition for the first time by the World Health Organization, and some countries have introduced legislation attempting to
address this issue. Moreover, the public dialogue concerning interactive entertainment may have an adverse impact on our reputation and consumers' willingness to purchase our products.

The
adoption and enforcement of legislation that restricts the marketing, content, business model, or sales of our products in countries in which we do business may harm the sales of our
products, as the products we are able to offer to our customers and the size of the potential audience for our products may be limited. We may be required to modify certain product development
processes or products or alter our marketing strategies to comply with regulations, which could be costly or delay the release of our products. In addition, the laws and regulations affecting our
products vary by territory and may be inconsistent with one another, imposing conflicting or uncertain restrictions. Failure to comply with any applicable legislation may also result in
government-imposed fines or other penalties, as well as harm to our reputation. Because the King Acquisition significantly increased our user population, we are
subject us to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions, which may exacerbate the potential adverse impact on our business.



Change in government regulations relating to the Internet could negatively impact our business.

We rely on our consumers' access to significant levels of Internet bandwidth for the sale and digital delivery of our content and the
functionality of our games with online features. Changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, including laws impacting "net neutrality," could
impair our consumers' online video game experiences, decrease the demand for our products and services or increase our cost of doing business. Although certain jurisdictions have implemented laws and
regulations intended to prevent Internet service providers from discriminating against particular types of legal traffic on their networks, other jurisdictions may lack such laws and regulations or
repeal existing laws or regulations. For example, in December 2017, the Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal net neutrality regulations in the U.S. and, following that decision, several
states enacted net neutrality regulations. Given uncertainty around these rules relating to the Internet, including changing interpretations, amendments, or repeal of those rules, coupled with the
potentially significant political and economic power of local Internet service providers and the relatively significant level of Internet bandwidth access our products and services require, we could
experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expenses, or otherwise negatively impact our business.

The laws and regulations concerning data privacy are continually evolving. Failure to comply with these laws
and regulations could harm our business.

Consumers play certain of our games online using our own distribution platforms, including Blizzard Battle.net, third-party platforms and
networks, through online social platforms, and on mobile devices. We collect and store information about our consumers, including consumers who play these games. In addition, we collect and store
information about our employees. We are subject to laws from a variety of jurisdictions regarding privacy and the protection of this information, including the E.U.'s General Data Protection
Regulation (the "GDPR"), the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), which regulates the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from children under 13 years of
age, and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations may increase our costs, subject us to expensive and distracting government investigations, and
result in substantial fines.

Data
privacy protection laws are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, the
E.U. has traditionally taken a broader view than the United States and certain other jurisdictions as to what is considered personal information and has imposed greater obligations under data privacy
and protection regulations, including those imposed under the GDPR. The U.S. government, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, as well as various U.S. state
governments, are continuing to review the need for greater regulation over the collection of personal information and information about consumer behavior on the Internet and on mobile devices.
Complying with emerging and changing laws could require us to incur substantial costs or impact our approach to operating and marketing our games. Due to the rapidly changing nature of these data
privacy protection laws, there is not always clear guidance from the respective governments and regulators regarding the interpretation of the law, which may create the risk of an inadvertent
violation. For example, the California legislature recently passed the California Consumer Privacy Act and the E.U. has proposed further reforms to its existing data protection legal framework, in
addition to the GDPR, which may further change our compliance obligations. Various government and consumer agencies worldwide have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. In
addition, in some cases, we are dependent upon our platform providers and external data processors to assist us in ensuring compliance with these various types of regulations, and a violation by one
of these third parties may also subject us to government investigations and result in substantial fines.



Player
interaction with our games is subject to our privacy policies, end user license agreements ("EULAs"), and terms of service. If we fail to comply with our posted privacy policies,
EULAs, or terms of service, or if we fail to comply with existing privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, it could result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental
authorities or others, which could result in fines or judgments against us, damage our reputation, impact our financial condition, and harm our business. If regulators, the media, consumers, or
employees raise any concerns about our privacy and data protection or consumer protection practices, even if unfounded, this could also result in fines or judgments against us, damage our reputation,
negatively impact our financial condition, or damage our business.

We depend on servers and networks to operate our games with online features and our proprietary online gaming
service. If we were to lose functionality in any of these areas for any reason, our business may be negatively impacted.

Our business relies on the continuous operation of servers, some of which are owned and operated by third parties. Although we strive to
maintain more than sufficient server capacity, and provide for active redundancy in the event of limited hardware failure, any broad-based catastrophic server malfunction, a significant
service-disrupting attack or intrusion by hackers that
circumvents security measures, a failure of disaster recovery service or the failure of a company on which we are relying for server capacity to provide that capacity for whatever reason would likely
degrade or interrupt the functionality of our games with online features, and could prevent the operation of such games altogether, any of which could result in the loss of sales for, or in, such
games. The risk is particularly pronounced with respect to the mobile games published by King, which rely on a small number of third-party owned data centers located in one city, with respect to the
functioning of our proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net, the disruption of which could prevent Blizzard from delivering content digitally or render all of Blizzard games, as well as
selected Activision content for the PC platform, unavailable, or with Activision's multiplayer game services which rely on systems hosted in a hybrid of data centers across the world as well as cloud
providers.

We
also rely on networks operated by third parties, such as the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live and Steam, for the sale and digital delivery of downloadable console and PC game content
and the functionality of our games with online features. Similarly, we rely on the continued operation of the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook for the sale of virtual currency for
our free-to-play games. An extended interruption to any of these services could adversely affect our ability to sell and distribute our digital products and operate our games with online features,
which could result in a loss of revenue and otherwise negatively impact our business.

Further,
insufficient server capacity could also negatively impact our business. Conversely, if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business, we may incur
additional operating costs.

Any cybersecurity-related attack, significant data breach or disruption of the information technology systems
or networks on which we rely could negatively impact our business.

In the course of our day-to-day business, we and third parties operating on our behalf create, store, and/or use commercially sensitive
information, such as the source code and game assets for our interactive entertainment software products and sensitive and confidential information with respect to our customers, consumers, and
employees. A malicious cybersecurity-related attack, intrusion, or disruption by hackers (including through spyware, viruses, phishing, denial of service, and similar attacks) or other breach of the
systems on which such source code and assets, account information (including personal information), and other sensitive data is stored could lead to piracy of our software, fraudulent activity,
disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, our customers', consumers' or employees' personal information (including personally identifiable information), or our own business



data.
Such incidents could also lead to product code-base and game distribution platform exploitation, should undetected viruses, spyware, or other malware be inserted into our products, services, or
networks, or systems used by our consumers. We have implemented cybersecurity programs and the tools, technologies, processes, and procedures intended to secure our data and systems, and prevent and
detect unauthorized access to, or loss of, our data, or the data of our customers, consumers, or employees. However, because these cyberattacks may remain undetected for prolonged periods of time and
the techniques used by criminal hackers and other third parties to breach systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. A data
intrusion into a server for a game with online features or for our proprietary online gaming service could also disrupt the operation of such game or platform. If we are subject to cybersecurity
breaches, or a security-related incident that materially disrupts the availability of our products and services, we may have a loss in sales or subscriptions or be forced to pay damages or incur other
costs, including from the implementation of additional cyber and physical security measures, or suffer reputational damage. Additionally, while we maintain insurance policies, they may be insufficient
to reimburse the Company for all losses or all types of claims that may be caused by cyberbreaches or system or network disruptions. Moreover, if there were a public perception that our data
protection measures are inadequate, whether or not the case, it could result in reputational damage and potential harm to our business relationships or the public perception of our business model. In
addition, such cybersecurity breaches may subject us to legal claims or proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, especially if there is loss, disclosure, or misappropriation of,
or access to, our customers' personal information or other sensitive information, or there is otherwise an intrusion into our customers' privacy.

Our reported financial results could be significantly impacted by changes in financial accounting standards
or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves.

Our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the SEC and national accounting standards bodies and the
methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. Policies affecting revenue recognition have affected, and could further significantly affect, the way we report
revenues related to our products and services. We recognize a majority of the revenues from video games that include an online service on a deferred basis over an estimated service period for such
games. In addition, we defer the cost of revenues of those products. Further, as we increase our downloadable content and add new features to our online services, our estimate of the service period
may change, and we could be required to recognize revenues, and defer related costs, over a shorter or longer period of time. As we enhance, expand and diversify our business and product offerings,
the application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for revenues and income taxes, could have a significant impact on our reported
net revenues, net income and earnings per share under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States in any given period.

Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control.

Our Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws contain a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and
special meetings. The regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the Company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would
support this effort. In addition, our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of so-called "blank check" preferred stock. This ability of our Board of Directors
to issue and fix the rights and preferences of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control.



Historically, our stock price has been highly volatile.

The trading price of our common stock has been, and could continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, including
for example, but without limitation:

•

quarter-to-quarter variations in the results of our operations;

•

the announcement of new products;

•

the announcement of lower prices on competing products;

•

Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.

Our corporate headquarters and our primary corporate data center are located in the Los Angeles, California area, which is near a major
earthquake fault. A major earthquake or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems, or otherwise prevents
us from conducting our normal business operations, could require significant expenditures to resume operations and negatively impact our business. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of
these events, the potential liabilities associated with such events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Further, our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster
recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Any such event could also limit the ability of retailers, distributors or our other customers to sell or distribute our products.

If general economic conditions decline, demand for our products could decline.

Purchases of our products and services involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers. Consumers are generally more willing to make
discretionary purchases, including purchases of products and services like ours, during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. As a result, our products are sensitive to general
economic conditions and economic cycles. A reduction or shift in domestic or international consumer spending could result in an increase in our
selling and promotional expenses, in an effort to offset that reduction, and could negatively impact our business.



Item 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

Item 2.    PROPERTIES

Our principal corporate and administrative offices, which includes our Activision segment's headquarters, are located in Santa Monica,
California and consist of approximately 165,000 square feet of leased office space.

Our
Activision segment primarily leases office space for development studio personnel, with a total of approximately 475,000 square feet of leased spaces throughout the U.S., primarily
in California, New York, and Wisconsin. We also lease approximately 721,000 square feet of office space in Irvine, CA for our Blizzard segment's headquarters, which includes administrative and
development studio space, and approximately 68,000 square feet of office space in London, United Kingdom for our King segment's headquarter offices. King also leases approximately 210,000 square feet
of office space in Barcelona, Spain for additional administrative and development studio space.

In
total, we have approximately 100 facility leases, primarily for other administrative and sales functions and development studio personnel, in the following countries: Australia,
Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

The
only facilities currently owned by the Company are two European warehouses utilized by the Distribution segment, one located in Burglengenfeld, Germany, and the other in Venlo, the
Netherlands.

We
anticipate no difficulty in extending the leases of our facilities or obtaining comparable facilities in suitable locations, as needed, and we consider our facilities to be adequate
for our current needs.

Item 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In December 2018, we received a decision from the STA informing us of an audit assessment to a Swedish subsidiary of King for the 2016 tax year.
The STA decision described the basis for issuing a transfer pricing assessment of approximately 3.5kr billion (approximately $400 million) primarily concerning an alleged intercompany asset
transfer. We disagree with the STA's decision and intend to vigorously contest it. We plan to pursue all remedies available to us to successfully resolve the matter, including administrative remedies
with the STA, multilateral procedures with other relevant taxing jurisdictions, and, if necessary, judicial remedies. Further, we may be required to pay the full assessment to the STA in advance of
the final resolution of the matter. While we believe our tax provisions at December 31, 2018, are appropriate, until such time as this matter is ultimately resolved we could be subject to
significant additional tax liabilities.

In
December 2017, we received a Notice of Reassessment from the FTA related to transfer pricing for intercompany transactions involving one of our French subsidiaries for the 2011
through 2013 tax years. The total assessment, including penalties and interest, was approximately €571 million (approximately $652 million). We disagree with the proposed
assessment and intend to vigorously contest it. We plan to pursue all remedies available to us to successfully resolve this matter, including administrative remedies with the FTA and, if necessary,
judicial remedies. While we believe our tax provisions at December 31, 2018, are appropriate, until such time as this matter is ultimately resolved we could be subject to significant additional
tax liabilities. In addition to the risk of additional tax for the 2011 through 2013 tax years, if litigation regarding this matter were adversely determined and/or if the FTA were to seek adjustments
of a similar nature for subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.



In
addition, we are party to routine claims, suits, investigations, audits, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to intellectual
property, competition and antitrust matters, regulatory matters, tax matters, privacy matters, labor and employment matters, compliance matters, unclaimed property matters, liability and personal
injury claims, product damage claims, collection matters, and/or commercial claims. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, such routine claims and lawsuits are not
significant and we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

10b5-1 Stock Trading Plans

The Company's directors and employees may, at a time they are not aware of material non-public information, enter into plans to purchase or sell
shares of our common stock that satisfy the requirements of Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 ("Rule 10b5-1 Plans"). Rule 10b5-1 Plans permit persons whose ability to purchase or sell our
common stock may otherwise be substantially restricted (by quarterly and special stock-trading blackouts and by their possession from time to time of material nonpublic information) to trade on a
pre-arranged, "automatic-pilot" basis.

Trading
under Rule 10b5-1 Plans is subject to certain conditions, including that the person for whom the plan is created (or anyone else aware of material non-public information
acting on such person's behalf) not exercise any subsequent influence regarding the amount, price, and dates of transactions under the plan. In addition, the Company requires Rule 10b5-1 Plans
to be established and maintained in accordance with the Company's "Policy on Establishing and Maintaining 10b5-1 Trading Plans."

Trades
under a Rule 10b5-1 Plan by our directors and employees are not necessarily indicative of their respective opinions of our current or potential future performance at the
time of the trade. Trades by our directors and executive officers pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the SEC, in
accordance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities

On January 31, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to
$1.5 billion of our common stock during the two-year period from February 14, 2019 until the earlier of February 13, 2021 and a determination by the Board of Directors to
discontinue the repurchase program.

On
February 2, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we were authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock during
the two-year period from February 13, 2017 through February 12, 2019. We did not repurchase any shares under this program.

Item 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Business Overview

Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and
distribute content and services on video game
consoles, PC, and mobile devices. We also operate esports leagues and events and create film and television content based on our intellectual property. The terms "Activision Blizzard," the "Company,"
"we," "us," and "our" are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

The King Acquisition

On February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion, as further
described in Note 23 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of King commencing on February 23, 2016.

Reportable Segments

Based upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments: Activision, Blizzard, and King.

(i)    Activision

Activision is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the console platforms.
Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that
distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products primarily based on our internally developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties.

In
2010, Activision entered into an exclusive relationship with Bungie to publish games in the Destiny franchise. Effective December 31, 2018, Activision and Bungie mutually
agreed to terminate their publishing relationship related to the Destiny franchise. As part of this termination, Activision agreed to transfer its publishing rights for the Destiny franchise to Bungie
in exchange for cash and Bungie's assumption of on-going customer obligations of Activision. Going forward, Activision no longer has any material rights or obligations related to the Destiny
franchise. As a result of the agreement to terminate the relationship, the Company recognized net bookings—a key operating
metric—of $20 million, GAAP revenues of $164 million, and GAAP operating income of $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

(ii)   Blizzard

Blizzard is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the PC platform. Blizzard
primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that
distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content and selected Activision
content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content. Blizzard also includes the activities of the Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with
city-based teams, and our MLG business, which is responsible for various esports events and serves as a multi-platform network for Activision Blizzard esports content.



(iii)  King

King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, primarily on mobile platforms, such as Google's Android and
Apple's iOS. King also distributes its content and services on the PC platform, primarily via Facebook. King's games are free to play; however, players can acquire in-game items, either with virtual
currency or real currency, and we continue to focus on in-game advertising as a growing source of additional revenue.

Other

We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:

•

the Studios business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of globally recognized
intellectual properties; and

•

the Distribution business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to
third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Business Results and Highlights

Financial Results

The Company's 2018 financial results are presented in accordance with a new revenue accounting standard that was adopted in the first quarter of
2018. Prior period results have not been restated to reflect this change in accounting standards. Further information about our adoption of the new standard is provided in Notes 2 and 3 of the
notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

financial highlights included:

•

consolidated net revenues increased 7% to $7.5 billion and consolidated operating income increased 52% to $2.0 billion, as
compared to consolidated net revenues of $7.0 billion and consolidated operating income of $1.3 billion in 2017;

•

revenues from digital online channels increased 6% to $5.8 billion, or 77% of consolidated net revenues, as compared to
$5.5 billion, or 78% of consolidated net revenues, in 2017;

•

operating margin was 26.5%, as compared to 18.7% in 2017;

•

cash flows from operating activities were approximately $1.79 billion, a decrease of 19%, as compared to $2.21 billion in 2017;

•

consolidated net income increased to $1.8 billion, as compared to $273 million in 2017, which included significant discrete
tax-related impacts in both 2017 and 2018—refer to Consolidated Results discussion below for details; and

•

diluted earnings per common share increased to $2.35, as compared to $0.36 in 2017.

Since
certain of our games are hosted online or include significant online functionality that represents a separate performance obligation, we defer the transaction price allocable to
the online functionality from the sale of these games and recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year. Net revenues and
operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018, include net effects of $238 million and $100 million, respectively, from the recognition of deferred net revenues and
related cost of revenues.



Content Release and Event Highlights

Games and downloadable content that were released during 2018, include:

•

Activision's four downloadable content packs for

Call of Duty: WWII

;

•

Activision's

Warmind

and

Forsaken

, the second
and third expansions to

Destiny 2

;

•

Activision's

Call of Duty: Black Ops 4

;

•

Activision's

Spyro™ Reignited Trilogy

, a remastered version of the first three
Spyro the Dragon games;

•

Blizzard's latest expansions to

Hearthstone—The Witchwood™

,

The Boomsday
Project™

, and

Rastakhan's Rumble™

;

•

Blizzard's

World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth™

, the seventh expansion to World
of Warcraft; and

•

King's

Candy Crush Friends Saga™

, the latest title in the Candy Crush franchise.

The
Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, completed its inaugural season in 2018 with 12 initial teams. During 2018, we also
completed the sale of an additional eight teams, which are competing in the league's second season that began in February 2019.

International Sales

International sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop content that is
specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 54%, 55%, and 55% of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by consumers in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign
currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies. Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes
in local economies.

Operating Metrics

The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business.

Net Bookings

We monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business. Net bookings is the net amount of products and
services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others. Net bookings is equal to net revenues excluding the impact
from deferrals.

Net
bookings was as follows (amounts in millions):

2018 vs. 2017

The
increase in net bookings for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to:

•

higher net bookings from

World of Warcraft

, driven by

World of
Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth

, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in 2017;

•

higher net bookings from

Call of Duty: WWII

, which was released in November 2017, as compared
to

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare

TM

(which, when referred to herein, is inclusive of

Call of Duty: Modern
Warfare

®

Remastered

), which was released in November 2016;

•

higher net bookings from the Candy Crush franchise, primarily due to in-game advertisements, increased monetization, and the launch of

Candy Crush
Friends Saga

, the latest title in the Candy Crush franchise, in October 2018; and

•

net bookings from the

Spyro Reignited Trilogy

, which was released in November 2018, with no
comparable release in 2017.

The
increase was partially offset by:

•

lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise, driven by the release of

Destiny 2

in September
2017, with no comparable full-game release in 2018;

•

lower net bookings from

Overwatch

, which was released in May 2016; and

•

lower net bookings from

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare

, as compared to prior catalog releases.

2017 vs. 2016

The
increase in net bookings for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

•

higher net bookings from King titles, as 2017 included King net bookings for the full year, while 2016 only included King net bookings for the
partial period following the King Closing Date, as well as higher net bookings from the Candy Crush franchise, due to in-game events and features;

•

higher net bookings from the Destiny franchise, driven by the release of

Destiny 2

;

•

higher net bookings from

Call of Duty: WWII

, as compared to

Call of
Duty: Infinite Warfare

, the comparable 2016 title;

•

higher net bookings from the continued strength of

Call of Duty: Black Ops III

, as compared to
prior catalog releases, driven by the downloadable content pack,

Zombies Chronicles

, which was released in May 2017, and the continued strength of
microtransactions; and

•

net bookings from

Crash Bandicoot

TM

N. Sane
Trilogy

, which was released in June 2017.

The
increase was partially offset by:

•

lower net bookings from

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare

, as compared to the performance of

Call of Duty: Black Ops
III

, the comparable 2015 title;

•

lower net bookings from

Overwatch

;

•

lower net bookings from

World of Warcraft

, driven by the release of

World of Warcraft:
Legion™

in August 2016, with no comparable release in 2017; and

•

lower net bookings from the Skylanders

®

franchise, due to the release of

Skylanders Imaginators

in October 2016,
with no comparable release in 2017.



Monthly Active Users

We monitor monthly active users ("MAUs") as a key measure of the overall size of our user base. MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed
a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in
the period. An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on
two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally
be counted as a single user.

The
number of MAUs for a given period can be significantly impacted by the timing of new content releases, since new releases may cause a temporary surge in MAUs. Accordingly, although
we believe that overall trending in the number of MAUs can be a meaningful performance metric, period-to-period fluctuations may not be indicative of longer-term trends. The following table details
our average MAUs on a sequential quarterly basis for each of our reportable segments (amounts in millions):

Average
MAUs increased by 11 million, or 3%, for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in
Activision's average MAUs is driven by the Call of Duty franchise, due to the launch of

Call of Duty: Black Ops 4

in October 2018. The increase in
King's average MAUs is due to the launch of

Candy Crush Friends Saga

in October 2018.

Average
MAUs decreased by 29 million, or 8%, for the three months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. The
year-over-year decrease in King's average MAUs is due to decreases across King's franchises from less engaged users leaving the network. King MAUs were also negatively impacted by a King network
outage resulting from changes made in the second quarter of 2018 by a third-party partner which inadvertently impacted some users' ability to play and spend money in King games. The year-over-year
decrease in Blizzard's average MAUs is due to lower MAUs for

Hearthstone

and

Overwatch

.

Management's Overview of Business Trends

Interactive Entertainment Growth, Including Mobile Gaming

Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry. Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and
we estimate the total industry has grown, on average, 18% annually from 2015 to 2018. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes
more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.

Further,
the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable audience for gaming significantly by
introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is estimated to be larger than console and PC gaming, and continues to
grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and our other business



units
have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from, our franchises.

Opportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games

Our fans spend significant time investing in our franchises through purchases of our game content, whether through purchases of full games or
downloadable content or via microtransactions. Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emerging
opportunities to drive additional engagement and investment in our franchises outside of games. These opportunities include esports, film and television, and consumer products. Our efforts to build
these adjacent opportunities are still relatively nascent, but we view them as potentially significant sources of future revenues.

For
example, as part of our efforts to take advantage of the esports opportunity, during 2017 we completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch League, the first major global
professional esports league with city-based teams, which completed its inaugural season in July 2018. During 2018, we also completed the sale of eight additional teams, which are competing in the
league's second season that began in February 2019.

Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises

The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry. According to
The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 38% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2018. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues historically has been
derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games have been responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, the Call of Duty, Candy
Crush, and World of Warcraft franchises, collectively, accounted for 58% of our consolidated net revenues—and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income—for
2018.

The
top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. Of the top 10 console franchises in the U.S.
in 2018, all 10 are from established franchises. Similarly, according to U.S rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play store per App Annie Intelligence as of December 2018, the top 10 mobile
games have held such ranking for an average of 28 months.

In
addition to investing in, and developing sequels and content for, our top franchises, we are continually exploring additional ways to expand those franchises. Further, while there is
no guarantee of success, we invest in new properties in an effort to develop future top franchises. For example, in 2014, we released

Hearthstone

, and
in 2016, we released

Overwatch

. Additionally, to diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase our presence on the mobile platform, in 2016 we
acquired King.

Overall,
we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our, and the industry's, revenues and profits in the
near future. Accordingly, our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against our competitors' top franchises can significantly impact our performance.

Recurring Revenue Business Models and Seasonality

Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a
more consistently recurring and year-round model. Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the
year. This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less
seasonal than games developed primarily for the console or PC platforms.



While our business is shifting toward a year-round engagement model, the interactive entertainment industry remains somewhat seasonal. We have historically
experienced our highest sales volume, particularly for Activision, in the calendar year-end holiday buying season. Following the acquisition of King, which focuses on free-to-play games, which are
generally less seasonal, and as we otherwise make the shift to a year-round model, less of our revenues are generated during the fourth quarter. For our reportable segments, the aggregate percentage
of our revenue represented by the fourth quarter in 2018 was 39%, as compared to 52% in 2013.

Outlook

In 2019, we expect to have a lighter slate of full game releases than in 2018. We plan to release our latest Call of Duty game in the second
half of 2019, along with

Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice

and

Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled

in the first half
of 2019. In addition, we expect to deliver ongoing content for our various franchises, including continued in-game content for

Call of Duty: Black
Ops 4

, expansion packs for

Hearthstone

, and in-game events for

Overwatch

.
Overall, we expect lower revenues and earnings per share in 2019 as compared to 2018.

We
will also continue to invest in new opportunities that we think have the potential to drive our growth over the long-term, including building on our advertising and esports
initiatives.

Focusing Development Resources and Restructuring Plan

In order to better capitalize on long-term growth opportunities, on February 12, 2019, the Company committed to a Board-authorized
restructuring plan under which the Company plans to refocus its resources on its largest opportunities and to remove unnecessary levels of complexity and duplication from certain parts of the
business. More specifically, we intend to:

•

increase our investment in development for our largest, internally-owned franchises—across upfront releases, in-game content,
mobile and geographic expansion;

•

reduce certain non-development and administrative-related costs across our business; and

•

integrate our global and regional sales and "go-to-market," partnerships, and sponsorships capabilities across the business, which we believe
will enable us to provide better opportunities for talent, and greater expertise and scale on behalf of our business units.

We
expect to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $150 million in 2019, related to severance, including, in many cases, above legally required amounts
(approximately 65% of the aggregate charge), facilities costs (approximately 20% of the aggregate charge), and asset write-downs and other costs (approximately 15% of the aggregate charge). We expect
the majority of these charges to be incurred in the first quarter of 2019, with most of the balance expected to be
incurred in the remainder of 2019. The total pre-tax charge associated with the restructuring will be paid almost entirely in cash and the outlays are expected to be incurred throughout 2019.

Represents
the loss on extinguishment of debt we recognized associated with our debt financing activities as follows:

•

the 2018 loss on extinguishment is comprised of a $25 million premium payment and an $8 million write-off of unamortized discount
and deferred financing costs associated with the redemption in August 2018 of our unsecured senior notes due September 2023 that we issued on September 19, 2013 (the "2023 Notes"), along with a
$7 million write-off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs associated with the extinguishment of our outstanding term loans;

•

the 2017 loss on extinguishment is comprised of a $12 million write-off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs associated
with refinancing activities on our term loans; and

•

and the 2016 loss on extinguishment is comprised of a premium payment of $63 million and a write-off of unamortized discount and
financing costs of $29 million associated with the extinguishment of certain term loan and senior note facilities through our refinancing activities.

Consolidated net revenues

2018 vs. 2017

The
increase in consolidated net revenues for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to:

•

an increase of $455 million in revenues recognized from Activision, primarily due to (1) higher revenues recognized from the
Destiny franchise, driven by

Destiny 2

, which was released in September 2017, with no comparable release in 2016, and by revenues recognized in
connection with the sale of our Destiny publishing rights to Bungie, (2) higher revenues recognized from

Call of Duty: WWII

, which was released
in November 2017, as compared to

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare

, which was released in November 2016, (3) higher revenues recognized from

Call of Duty: Black Ops

, which was released in October 2018, as compared to

Call of Duty: WWII

, and
(4) revenues from the

Spyro Reignited Trilogy

, which was released in November 2018, with no comparable release in 2017, partially offset by lower
revenues recognized from

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare

, as compared to prior catalog releases; and

•

an increase of $105 million in revenues from King, despite the impact from the network outage in the second quarter of 2018 as discussed
above, primarily driven by the Candy Crush franchise's higher revenues due to in-game advertisements, increased monetization, and the launch of

Candy Crush Friends
Saga

, the latest title in the Candy Crush franchise, in October 2018.

The
increase was partially offset by a decrease of $74 million in revenues recognized from Blizzard, primarily due to lower revenues recognized from

Overwatch

, which was released in May 2016, partially
offset by higher revenues recognized from

World of
Warcraft

, driven by

World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth

, which was released in August 2018, with no comparable release in
2017.

2017 vs. 2016

The
increase in consolidated net revenues for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

•

higher revenues from King titles, as 2017 included King revenues for the full year, while 2016 only included King revenues for the partial
period following the King Closing Date, as well as higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchise, due to in-game events and features;

•

higher revenues recognized from the continued strength of

Call of Duty: Black Ops III

, as
compared to prior catalog releases, driven by the downloadable content pack,

Zombies Chronicles

, which was released in May 2017, and the continued
strength of microtransactions;

•

revenues from

Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy

, which was released in June 2017; and

•

higher revenues recognized from

Call of Duty: WWII

, as compared to

Call
of Duty: Infinite Warfare

, the comparable 2016 title.



The
increase was partially offset by:

•

lower revenues recognized from

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare

, as compared to the performance
of

Call of Duty: Black Ops III

, the comparable 2015 title; and

•

lower revenues from the Skylanders franchise, due to the release of

Skylanders Imaginators

in
October 2016, with no comparable release in 2017.

Change in Deferred Revenues Recognized

2018 vs. 2017

The
increase in net deferred revenues recognized for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $625 million in net deferred revenues
recognized from Activision, primarily due to higher net deferred revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise, driven by

Destiny 2

, which was released
in September 2017, and its associated in-game content, with no comparable release in 2016.

The
increase was partially offset by a decrease of $226 million in net deferred revenues recognized from Blizzard, primarily due to a net deferral of revenues for

World of Warcraft

, driven by

World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth

, which was released in August 2018,
with no comparable release in 2017.

2017 vs. 2016

The
decrease in net deferred revenues recognized for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

•

a net deferral of revenues for the Destiny franchise, primarily due to

Destiny 2

, as compared
to net deferred revenues recognized in the comparable prior period; and

•

a higher net deferral of revenues from the Call of Duty franchise, primarily due to the stronger performance of

Call of
Duty: WWII

in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare

in the fourth quarter of 2016.

The
decrease was partially offset by:

•

net deferred revenues recognized from

Overwatch

in 2017, as compared to a net deferral of
revenues in 2016 due to the release of

Overwatch

in May 2016; and

•

net deferred revenues recognized from

World of Warcraft

in 2017, as compared to a net deferral
of revenues in 2016 due to the release of

World of Warcraft: Legion

in August 2016.

Foreign Exchange Impact

Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $102 million, a positive impact of $42 million, and a negative impact
of $81 million on Activision Blizzard's consolidated net revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the previous year. The changes are primarily due to
changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.

Operating Segment Results

Currently, we have three reportable segments—Activision, Blizzard, and King. Our operating segments are consistent with the manner
in which our operations are reviewed and managed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of: the impact of
the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; share-based compensation expense; amortization of intangible assets as a result of
purchase price accounting; fees and other expenses (including legal fees, expenses, and accruals) related to acquisitions, associated integration activities,



and
financings; certain restructuring costs; and certain other non-cash charges. The CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis, and accordingly, no
disclosure is made with respect thereto.

Our
operating segments are also consistent with our internal organizational structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the availability of separate
financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments.

deliverable. As such, we are required to recognize revenues from these titles over the estimated service periods, which are generally less than twelve months. The related cost of revenues are deferred
and recognized when the related revenues are recognized. In the operating segment results table, we reflect the net effect from the deferrals of revenues and (recognition) of deferred revenues, along

, the latest title in the Candy Crush franchise, in October 2018.

2017 vs. 2016

The
increase in King's net revenues for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

•

2017 including King revenues for the full year, while 2016 only included King revenues for the partial period following the King Closing Date;

•

higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchise, due to in-game events and features.

Segment Income from Operations

Activision

2018 vs. 2017

Activision's
operating income for 2018 was comparable to 2017. Decreases in operating income were primarily from:

, which was released in November 2017.

These
were largely offset by increases to operating income from:

•

lower product costs, lower software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses, and lower sales and marketing costs, all
primarily driven by the Destiny franchise, as 2017 included the full game release of

Destiny 2

, with no comparable full game franchise release in 2018;
and

•

higher capitalization of software development costs due to increased costs and the timing of game development cycles.

2017 vs. 2016

The
increase in Activision's operating income for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to higher revenues, as discussed above, and lower costs associated with
the Skylanders franchise, as there was not a new title released in 2017.

The
increase was partially offset by higher sales and marketing spend on the Destiny franchise due to the release of

Destiny 2

.



Blizzard

2018 vs. 2017

The
decrease in Blizzard's operating income for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to:

•

higher costs to operate and support Blizzard's existing business and adjacent areas of opportunity; and

•

higher software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses driven by

World of Warcraft: Battle for
Azeroth

, which was released in August 2018.

The
decrease was partially offset by higher revenues, as discussed above, and higher capitalization of software development costs due to the timing of game development cycles.

2017 vs. 2016

The
decrease in Blizzard's operating income for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to lower revenues, as discussed above, along with higher product
development costs resulting from lower capitalization of software development costs due to the timing of game development cycles.

The
decrease was partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs and software amortization for

Overwatch

and

World of Warcraft: Legion

, due to their
respective launches in 2016, with no comparable releases in 2017.

King

2018 vs. 2017

The
increase in King's operating income for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchise, as discussed above.

2017 vs. 2016

The
increase in King's operating income for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

•

2017 including King's results of operations for the full year, while 2016 only included King's results of operations for the partial period
following the King Closing Date; and

•

higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchise, as discussed above.

Foreign Exchange Impact

Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $48 million, a positive impact of $85 million, and a negative impact of
$30 million on reportable segment net revenues for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the previous year. The changes are primarily due to changes in the
value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and British pound.

, as compared to prior catalog
releases.



2017 vs. 2016

period following the King Closing Date, as well as higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchise due to in-game events and features; and

of Duty: Infinite Warfare

Cost of Revenues—Product Sales

:

2018 vs. 2017

The
slight decrease in product costs for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to a decrease of $20 million in product costs from Activision, primarily
related to the absence of title releases for the Guitar Hero

®

and Skylanders franchises, which was partially offset by higher product costs from our lower
margin Distribution business due to increased product sales.

The
increase in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to product sales for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to an increase of
$89 million in software amortization and royalties from Activision, primarily due to higher software amortization and royalties for (1) the Destiny franchise and
(2)

Call of Duty: Black Ops 4

, which was released in October 2018, as compared to

Call of Duty:
WWII

, which was released in November 2017, partially offset by



lower
software amortization and royalties from

Call of Duty: WWII

, as compared to

Call of Duty: Infinite
Warfare

, which was released in November 2016.

2017 vs. 2016

Product
costs for 2017, were comparable to 2016, primarily due to lower product costs from the Skylanders franchise as there was no new release in 2017, offset by
higher product costs resulting from the increased revenues of our relatively lower-margin Distribution business.

The
decrease in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to product sales for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due
to:

•

lower software amortization associated with

Guitar Hero Live

, which was released in October
2015;

•

lower software amortization from

Overwatch

, which was released in May 2016; and

•

lower software amortization from the Skylanders franchise as there was no new release in 2017.

The
decrease was partially offset by higher software amortization associated with the Destiny franchise, primarily due to the release of

Destiny

in September 2017.

Cost of Revenues—Subscription, Licensing, and Other Revenues:

2018 vs. 2017

The
increase in game operations and distribution costs for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to higher personnel, facilities, and equipment costs of
$50 million associated with our esports broadcasting operations and online games.

The
decrease in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to subscription, licensing, and other revenues for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily
due to a decrease of $121 million in amortization of internally-developed franchise intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisition of King. The decrease was partially offset by an
increase of $35 million in software amortization and royalties from Activision, primarily due to the release of expansions for

Destiny 2.

2017 vs. 2016

The
increase in game operations and distribution costs for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to platform provider fees associated with the increase in
revenues from King.

Software
royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to subscription, licensing, and other revenues for 2017 were comparable to 2016.

2018 vs 2017

The
increase in product development costs for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $101 million in personnel and external developer
costs to support existing and upcoming title releases. The higher costs were partially offset by an increase of $68 million in capitalization of software development costs due to the increased
costs previously noted and the timing of game development cycles.



2017 vs 2016

The
increase in product development costs for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

•

higher Blizzard product development costs resulting from lower capitalization of software development costs due to the timing of game
development cycles; and

•

increased product development costs for King, as 2017 included King's costs for a full year, while 2016 only included King's costs for the
partial period following the King Closing Date.

2018 vs. 2017

The
decrease in sales and marketing expenses for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to:

•

a decrease of $263 million in amortization of the customer base intangible asset acquired as part of our acquisition of King, as the
asset was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2018; and

•

a decrease of $49 million in marketing spending and personnel costs, primarily associated with (1) the Destiny franchise, due to
the release of

Destiny 2

in September 2017, with no comparable full-game release in 2018, (2) the Bubble Witch franchise, as

Bubble Witch 3 Saga

TM

was released during the first quarter of 2017, and
(3)

Overwatch

, partially offset by an increases in marketing spending and personnel costs for the Candy Crush franchise, which had the release of

Candy Crush Friends
Saga

in October 2018.

2017 vs. 2016

The
increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

•

higher sales and marketing costs for the Destiny franchise, given the release of

Destiny 2

in
September 2017; and

•

increased amortization of the customer base intangible assets acquired in the King Acquisition and increased sales and marketing costs to
support King's titles, as 2017 included a full year of costs, while 2016 only included King's costs for the partial period following the King Closing Date.

2018 vs. 2017

The
increase in general and administrative expenses for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $65 million in personnel costs (including
stock-based compensation expense), professional fees, and facilities costs to support the growth of our existing business and adjacent areas of opportunity.



2017 vs. 2016

The
increase in general and administrative expenses for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

•

increased personnel costs, including stock compensation expenses, to support the growth in our business and adjacent areas of opportunity;

•

the inclusion of a non-cash accounting charge to reclassify certain losses included in our cumulative translation adjustments into earnings due
to the substantial liquidation of certain of our foreign entities, with no comparable activity in 2016;

•

restructuring charges, primarily severance costs, incurred in 2017 with no comparable activity in 2016; and

•

higher foreign currency transaction losses.

The
increase is partially offset by lower transaction costs as 2016 included the King Acquisition.

2018 vs. 2017

The
decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to:

•

an increase of $41 million in interest income from our cash and cash equivalents, due to higher average cash balances and higher
interest rates as compared to the prior-year period; and

•

a decrease of $22 million in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our debt obligations due to
our lower total debt outstanding as a result of our debt redemptions and repayment activities.

2017 vs. 2016

The
decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to our lower total outstanding debt and lower interest rates
on our current debt instruments as a result of our refinancing activities in 2016 and 2017. See further discussion below under "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company's income before income tax expense was $1.88 billion, $1.15 billion, and
$1.11 billion, respectively, and our income tax expense was $64 million (or a 3% effective tax rate), $878 million (or a 76% effective tax rate), and $140 million (or a 13%
effective tax rate), respectively. Our full year 2018 effective tax rate of 3% is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to one-time tax benefits related to the U.S. Tax Reform Act
(discussed further below), earnings taxed at relatively lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, recognition of excess tax benefits from shared-based payments, and research and development ("R&D")
credits, partially offset by changes in the Company's liability for uncertain tax positions.

In
2018, 2017, and 2016, our U.S. income before income tax expense was $432 million, $185 million, and $228 million, respectively, and comprised 23%, 16%, and 21%,
respectively, of our consolidated income before income tax expense. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our foreign income before income tax expense was $1,445 million, $966 million, and
$878 million, respectively, and comprised 77%, 84%, and 79%, respectively, of our consolidated income before income tax expense.

In
2018, 2017 and 2016, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, as compared to domestic earnings taxed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, lowered our effective tax
rate by 11 percentage
points, 24 percentage points, and 22 percentage points, respectively. The decrease in the foreign rate differential is due to the reduction of U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%
beginning in 2018.

The
overall effective income tax rate in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, such as changes in pre-tax income or loss by jurisdiction, applicable accounting rules,
applicable tax laws and regulations, and rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audits and other matters, and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre-tax income or
loss.

IRS Closing Agreement

On June 27, 2018, we entered into a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to resolve certain intercompany transfer
pricing arrangements for tax periods starting in 2009 (the "Closing Agreement"). The primary adjustments related to the Closing Agreement were recognized in the second quarter of 2018 and consisted of
a tax expense of $70 million and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $437 million. In addition, we recognized $185 million of tax benefits related to other tax adjustments
resulting from the changes in U.S. tax attributes and taxable income caused by the primary adjustments. The Closing Agreement resulted in federal and state cash tax payments totaling approximately
$345 million, of which federal tax payments of $334 million were made in October 2018.

We
evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability. We record a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet the threshold of "more likely than not" to be realized in the
future. To make that determination, we evaluate the likelihood of realization based on the weight of all positive and negative evidence available. As of December 31, 2017, we had a deferred tax
asset for California research and development credit carryforwards ("CA R&D Credits"), which can be carried forward indefinitely. The Closing Agreement impacts historical and prospective filings in
certain states, including California, and after considering the impact of the Closing Agreement on its prospective California taxable income, we determined that our remaining CA R&D Credits no longer
met the threshold of more likely than not to be realized in the future. As such, for the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a full valuation allowance of $61 million. We will
reassess this determination quarterly and record a tax benefit if and when future evidence allows for a partial or full release of this valuation allowance.



U.S. Tax Reform Act

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income
tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposed a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the "Transition Tax").

On
December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"), which provides guidance on how to account for the effects of the U.S. Tax
Reform Act under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740. SAB 118 enabled companies to record a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable
estimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year, until accounting is complete. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional amounts of $636 million
for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act in accordance with SAB 118. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we no longer considered the available cash balances related to undistributed
earnings held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested.

In
the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our analysis of the effect of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an additional tax benefit of
$285 million for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. This is primarily related to the election to record deferred U.S. taxes with respect to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries subject to
global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") and the adjustment for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the U.S. corporate income tax rate reduction. The
aggregate U.S. Tax Reform Act impact for 2017 and 2018 is a net tax expense of $351 million, which consists of a $570 million tax expense related to the Transition Tax, partially offset
by a net benefit of $219 million, mainly related to the adoption of GILTI deferred tax accounting and remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Further
analysis of the differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective tax rate, as well as other information about our income taxes, is provided in
Note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Foreign Exchange Impact

Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $68 million, a positive impact of $27 million, and a positive impact of
$10 million on Activision Blizzard's consolidated operating income in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The changes are primarily due to changes in
the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and British pound and its impact on our foreign operating income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. In the near term, we
expect our business and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance of cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments of $4.4 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our
operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months. Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as our anticipated dividend payments, share
repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities.

As
of December 31, 2018, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $1.4 billion, as compared to $3.0 billion
as of December 31, 2017. Following the enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform Act and the current period expense on unrepatriated earnings,



we
no longer consider these available cash balances, which primarily consist of undistributed earnings of our most significant foreign subsidiaries, to be indefinitely reinvested.

Our
cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the fourth quarter due
to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. We consider, on a continuing basis, various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions,
divestitures, joint ventures, share repurchases, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

The primary driver of net cash flows associated with our operating activities is the collection of customer receivables generated from the sale
of our products and services. These collections are typically partially offset by: payments to vendors for the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of our products; payments for customer service
support for our consumers; payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders; payments for interest on our debt; payments for software development; payments for tax liabilities; and
payments to our workforce.

2018 vs 2017

Net
cash provided by operating activities for 2018 was $1.79 billion, as compared to $2.21 billion for 2017. The decrease was primarily due
to:

•

higher tax payments, primarily due to payments in the U.S.; and

•

changes in our working capital due to the timing of collections and payments.

The
decrease was partially offset by higher net income in 2018 as compared to 2017.



2017 vs 2016

Net
cash provided by operating activities for 2017 was $2.21 billion, as compared to $2.16 billion for 2016. The increase was primarily due
to:

•

increased earnings after excluding the effects of charges due to impacts from the U.S. Tax Reform Act, which did not result in current year
cash outflows, and other non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expenses;

•

a full year of King operating cash flows; and

•

changes in our working capital due to the timing of collections and payments.

Net
cash provided by operating activities for 2017 included $145 million of interest paid on our outstanding debt, as compared to $209 million paid in 2016.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of
investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.

2018 vs 2017

Net
cash used in investing activities for 2018 was $230 million, as compared to $207 million for 2017. The increase in the cash used in investing
activities was primarily due to higher purchases of available-for-sale investments of $209 million for 2018, as compared to $135 million in 2017, partially offset
by:

•

higher proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale investments of $116 million in 2018, as compared to $80 million in 2017;
and

•

lower capital expenditures of $131 million in 2018, as compared to $155 million in 2017.

2017 vs 2016

Net
cash used in investing activities for 2017 was $207 million, as compared to $4.7 billion for 2016. The decrease in the cash used was primarily due to
cash used for the King Acquisition in 2016, with no comparable transaction in 2017. The decrease was partially offset by
purchases of available-for-sale investments, net of proceeds from maturities, of $55 million in 2017, with no comparable transactions in 2016.

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities

The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term
debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends.

2018 vs 2017

Net
cash used in financing activities for 2018 was $2.0 billion, as compared to $624 million for 2017. The increase was primarily attributed to our debt
financing activities. For 2018, we had debt



repayments,
inclusive of premium payments, of $1.8 billion, as compared to net debt repayments of $500 million for 2017. The increase in cash used in financing activities was further
impacted by:

•

lower proceeds from stock option exercises of $99 million for 2018, as compared to $178 million for 2017;

•

higher tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units of $94 million for 2018, as compared to $56 million
for 2017; and

•

higher dividends paid of $259 million for 2018, as compared to $226 million for 2017.

2017 vs 2016

Net
cash used in financing activities for 2017 was $624 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $500 million for 2016. The
changes were primarily attributed to our debt financing activities. For 2017, we had net debt repayments of $500 million, as compared to approximately $700 million of net debt proceeds,
inclusive of a premium payment, for 2016. The cash flows used in financing activities for 2017, were partially offset by:

•

higher proceeds from stock option exercises in 2017 of $178 million, as compared to $106 million for 2016; and

•

lower tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units in 2017 of $56 million, as compared to $115 million
in 2016.

Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes

Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $31 million, a positive impact of $76 million, and a negative impact of
$56 million on our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The change is primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar
relative to the euro and British pound.

Debt

As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our total outstanding debt was $2.7 billion and $4.4 billion,
respectively, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 3.18% and 3.58%, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had the following significant activity associated with
our debt instruments:

•

on August 16, 2018, using available cash on hand, we redeemed the $750 million of outstanding 2023 Notes in full at a redemption
price equal to (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes plus (2) a "make-whole" premium calculated as set forth in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes and (3) accrued
and unpaid interest to the redemption date, resulting in a "Loss on extinguishment of debt" recorded in the consolidated statement of operations of $33 million, comprised of premium payments of
$25 million and a write-off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of $8 million;

•

on August 24, 2018, using available cash on hand, we made a voluntary prepayment of $990 million to fully repay and extinguish
our outstanding term loans resulting in a write-off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of $7 million, which is included in "Loss on extinguishment of debt" in the consolidated
statement of operations; and

•

on August 24, 2018, we also entered into the seventh amendment to our Credit Agreement which, among other things, replaced our prior
revolving credit facility of $250 million with a new revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion, which is scheduled to mature on August 24, 2023.

debt obligations.

Dividends

On February 12, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.37 per common share, payable on May 9, 2019, to
shareholders of record at the close of business on March 28, 2019.

On
February 8, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per common share. On May 9, 2018, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of
$259 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2018.

Capital Expenditures

We made capital expenditures of $131 million in 2018, as compared to $155 million in 2017. In 2019, we anticipate total capital
expenditures of approximately $125 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases.

Commitments

Refer to Note 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for disclosures regarding our commitments.



Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties,
often referred to as "structured finance" or "special purpose" entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes,
that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates and assumptions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. The policies, estimates, and assumptions discussed below are considered by management to be
critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because their application places the most significant demands on management's
judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies,
estimates, and assumptions are described in the following paragraphs.

Adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard
replaces all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic, eliminating all industry-specific guidance and providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core
principle is that a company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be
entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments. As a result, we have updated our accounting policy
disclosures for revenue recognition herein. Refer to Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and see
"Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" below for further details on the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue primarily through the sale of our interactive entertainment content and services, principally for the console, PC, and
mobile platforms, as well as through the licensing of our intellectual property. Our products span various genres, including first-person shooter,
action/adventure, role-playing, strategy, and "match three." We primarily offer the following products and services:

•

full games, which typically provide access to main game content, primarily for the console or PC platform;

•

downloadable content, which provides players with additional in-game content to purchase following the purchase of a full game;

•

microtransactions, which typically provide relatively small pieces of additional in-game content or enhancements to gameplay; and

•

subscriptions to players in our World of Warcraft franchise, which provide continual access to the game content.



When
control of the promised products and services is transferred to our customers, we recognize revenue in the amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange
for these products and services.

We
determine revenue recognition by:

•

identifying the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

•

identifying the performance obligations in each contract;

•

determining the transaction price;

•

allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in each contract; and

•

recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services.

Certain
products are sold to customers with a "street date" (which is the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we recognize revenues on the later
of the street date and the date the product is sold to our customer. For digital full-game downloads sold to customers, we recognize revenue when it is available for download or is activated for
gameplay. Revenues are recorded net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed at the time of the specific revenue-producing transaction between us and our customer, such as sales
and value-added taxes.

Payment
terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment immediately upon purchase or within 30 to 90 days. In instances where
the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when we expect, at
contract inception, that the period between our transfer of a promised product or service to our customer and payment for that product or service will be one year or less.

Product Sales

Product sales consist of sales of our games, including physical products and digital full-game downloads. We recognize revenues from the sale of
our products after both (1) control of the products has been transferred to our customers and (2) the underlying performance obligations have been satisfied.

Revenues
from product sales are recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the
amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and price protection are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available.

Sales
incentives and other consideration given by us to our customers, such as rebates and product placement fees, are considered adjustments of the transaction price of our products and
are reflected as reductions to revenues. Sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for distinct goods or services received, such as the appearance of our products in
a customer's national circular ad, are recorded as "Sales and marketing" expense when the benefit from the sales incentive is separable from sales to the same customer and we can reasonably estimate
the fair value of the good or service.

Products with Online Functionality

For our software products that include both offline functionality (i.e., do not require an Internet connection to access) and significant
online functionality, such as for most of our titles from the Call of Duty franchise, we evaluate whether the license of our intellectual property and the online functionality are distinct and
separable. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on,



including
downloadable content. If we determine that our software products contain a license of intellectual property separate from the online functionality, we consider market conditions and other
observable inputs to estimate the transaction price for the license, since we do not generally sell the software license on a standalone basis. These products may be sold in a bundle with other
products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations.

We
recognize revenue for arrangements that include both a license of intellectual property and separate online functionality when control of the license transfers to our customers for
the portion of the transaction price allocable to the license and ratably over the estimated service period for the portion of the transaction price allocable to the online functionality. Similarly,
we defer a portion of the cost of revenues on these arrangements and recognize the costs as the related revenues are recognized. The cost of revenues that are deferred include product costs,
distribution costs, and software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses, and excludes intangible asset amortization.

Online Hosted Software Arrangements

For our online hosted software arrangements, such as titles for the Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush franchises, substantially all
gameplay and functionality are obtained through our continuous hosting of the game content for the player. Similar to our software products with online functionality, these arrangements may include
other products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations. Revenues related to online hosted software arrangements are generally recognized ratably over
the estimated service period.

Subscription Arrangements

Subscription revenue arrangements are mostly derived from

World of Warcraft

, which is playable
through Blizzard's servers and is generally sold on a subscription-only basis. Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the
consumer and are then recognized ratably over the subscription period as the performance obligations are satisfied.

Revenues
attributable to the purchase of

World of Warcraft

software by our customers, including expansion packs, are classified as
"Product sales," whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and other in-game revenues are classified as "Subscription, licensing, and other revenues."

Licensing Revenues

In certain countries, we utilize third-party licensees to distribute and host our games in accordance with license agreements, for which the
licensees typically pay us a fixed minimum guarantee and sales-based royalties. These arrangements typically include multiple performance obligations, such as an upfront license of intellectual
property and rights to specified or unspecified future updates. Our estimate of the selling price is comprised of several factors including, but not limited to, prior selling prices, prices charged
separately by other third-party vendors for similar service offerings, and a cost-plus-margin approach. Based on the allocated transaction price, we recognize revenue associated with the minimum
guarantee (1) when we transfer control of the upfront license of intellectual property, (2) upon transfer of control of future specified updates, and/or (3) ratably over the
contractual term in which we provide the customer with unspecified future updates. Royalty payments in excess of the minimum guarantee are generally recognized when the licensed product is sold by the
licensee.



Other Revenues

Other revenues primarily include revenues from downloadable content (e.g., multi-player content packs), microtransactions, and licensing
of intellectual property other than software to third-parties.

Microtransaction
revenues are derived from the sale of virtual currencies and goods to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from these sales of virtual currencies
and goods are initially recorded in deferred revenue. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods purchased with a virtual currency.
Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods directly are similarly recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods. We categorize our virtual goods as either "consumable" or "durable."
Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed and
our performance obligation is satisfied. Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of
durable virtual goods ratably over
the period of time the goods are available to the player and our performance obligation is satisfied, which is generally the estimated service period.

Revenues
from the licensing of intellectual property other than software to third parties primarily include the licensing of our (1) brand, logo, or franchise to customers and
(2) media content. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our brand or franchise are generally recognized over the license term. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license
of our media content are generally recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which may be upfront or over time.

Significant Judgment around Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Determining whether products and services are
considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Certain of our games, such as titles in the Call of Duty
franchise, may contain a license of our intellectual property to play the game offline, but also depend on a significant level of integration and interdependency with the online functionality. In
these cases, significant judgment is required to determine whether this license of our intellectual property should be considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted
for together with the online functionality provided and recognized over time. Generally, for titles in which the software license is functional without the online functionality and a significant
component of gameplay is available offline, we believe we have separate performance obligations for the license of the intellectual property and the online functionality.

Significant
judgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation and to determine whether there is a discount that needs to be
allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of the various products and services. To estimate the standalone selling price we consider market data, including our pricing strategies for
the product being evaluated and other similar products we may offer, competitor pricing to the extent data is available, and costs to determine whether the estimated selling price yields an
appropriate profit margin.

Estimated Service Period

We consider a variety of data points when determining the estimated service period for players of our games, including the weighted average
number of days between players' first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average number of
days between players' first purchase date and
last date played online. We also consider known online trends, the service periods of our previously released games, and, to the extent publicly available, the service periods of our competitors'
games that are similar in nature to ours. We believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of services to our



customers,
as it is the best representation of the time period during which our customers play our games. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires management's judgment.
Future usage patterns may differ from historical usage patterns, and therefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service periods for players of our current games are
generally less than 12 months.

Principal Agent Considerations

We evaluate sales of our products and content via third-party digital storefronts, such as Microsoft's Xbox Games Store, Sony's PSN, the Apple
App Store, and the Google Play Store, to determine whether our revenues should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront. Key indicators that we evaluate in determining whether we
are the principal in the sale (gross reporting) or an agent (net reporting) include, but are not limited to:

•

which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service; and

•

which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service.

Based
on our evaluation of the above indicators, we report revenues on a gross basis for sales arrangements via the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, and we report revenues on a
net
basis (i.e., net of fees retained by the digital storefront) for sales arrangements via Microsoft's Xbox Games Store and Sony's PSN.

Income Taxes

We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, the
provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability.
For those assets that do not meet the threshold of "more likely than not" that they will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.

Management
believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax
effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be
realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to tax expense in the period such determination is made. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant
judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of ASC Topic 740 and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations
could have a material impact on our business and results of operations in an interim period in which the uncertainties are ultimately resolved.

Significant
judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance
can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of
changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded,
such differences will



impact
the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are
considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.

Our
provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by: (1) changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,
(2) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; (3) tax effects of nondeductible compensation; (4) tax costs related to intercompany realignments;
(5) differences between amounts included in our tax filings and the estimate of such amounts included in our tax expenses; (6) changes in accounting principles; or (7) changes in
tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles or interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to multinational corporations. Significant judgment is required
to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all
income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the
continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and are regularly subject to audit by other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these
examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our
operating results and financial condition.

As
further described in "Consolidated Results" above, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S.
corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposed a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

On
December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118, which provided guidance on how to account for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act under ASC 740. SAB 118
enabled companies to record a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year, until
accounting is complete. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our analysis to determine the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. As a result, we made an election to record deferred U.S. taxes
with respect to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries subject to GILTI.

Allowances for Returns and Price Protection

We closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other publishers,
market conditions, and the anticipated timing of other releases to assess future demand of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent reorders are evaluated
with the goal of ensuring that quantities are sufficient to meet the demand from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel. We benchmark units
to be shipped to our customers using historical and industry data.

We
may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the circumstances in which we elect to
decrease, on a short- or longer-term basis, the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us
with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or receive price protection credits include, among other things,
compliance with applicable trading and payment terms, and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell-through reports to us. We may also consider other factors, including achievement of
sell-through performance targets, the facilitation of slow-moving inventory, and other market factors.



Significant
management judgments and estimates with respect to potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product revenues must be made and used when
establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period. We estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for current period product revenues utilizing
historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer. The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future
returns and price protection for a particular title: historical performance of titles in similar genres; historical performance of the hardware platform; historical performance of the franchise;
console hardware life cycle; sales force and retail customer feedback; industry pricing; future pricing assumptions; weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory; absolute quantity of on-hand retail
channel inventory; our warehouse on-hand inventory levels; the title's recent sell-through history (if available); marketing trade programs; and the performance of competing titles. The relative
importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other things, genre, platform, seasonality, and sales strategy.

Based
upon historical experience, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. However, actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a
number of reasons,
including, among others: a lack of consumer acceptance of a title; the release in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor; or technological obsolescence due to the emergence of new
hardware platforms. There may be material differences in the amount and timing of our revenues for any period if factors or market conditions change or if matters resolve in a manner that is
inconsistent with management's assumptions utilized in determining the allowances for returns and price protection. For example, a 1% change in our December 31, 2018 allowance for sales
returns, price protection, and other allowances would have impacted net revenues by approximately $2 million.

Software Development Costs

Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs
incurred for internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable.
Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and tested product design and a working model. Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established and the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where
proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Software development costs related to online hosted revenue arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project phase is
complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Prior to a product's release, if and when we believe capitalized costs
are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses." Capitalized costs for products that are
canceled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to "Product development" in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately
to "Product development."

Commencing
upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property
licenses" based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months to approximately two years.

We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior periods, the primary evaluation
criterion is the actual performance of the title to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected
performance of the specific products to which the costs relate. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include:



historical
performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to its release; general market conditions;
and, for any sequel product, estimated performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based.

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of
expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted
amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Material
differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's expectations.

Fair Value Estimates

The preparation of financial statements often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present in our consolidated
financial statements. Without an independent market or another representative transaction, determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently
difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting.

There
are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value. These include: (1) the market approach, where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or
liabilities are used to determine the fair value; (2) the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, future cash flows or future earnings) to a
single present amount; and (3) the cost approach, which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset. For many of our fair value estimates, including our estimates of the
fair value of acquired intangible assets, we use the income approach. Using the income approach requires the use of financial models, which require us to make various estimates including, but not
limited to: (1) the potential future cash flows for the asset, liability or equity instrument being measured; (2) the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows;
(3) the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows; and (4) the inherent risk associated with the cash flows (that is, the risk premium).
Determining these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective, and, if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate, our
financial results may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial
models or the related accounting conclusion reached. For example, a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an
asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired. While we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions, the
following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments:

Business Combinations.

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded based on their estimated fair value. Our assessment of the
estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives. Furthermore, a change in the estimated
fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill, which is an asset that is not amortized. Often determining the fair value of these assets and
liabilities assumed requires an assessment of the expected use of the asset, the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of
development of an acquired in-process technology. Such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements.



Assessment of Impairment of Definite-lived Intangible and Other Long-lived Assets.

We evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable amortizable intangible assets and other long-lived assets when events or circumstances
(referred to as a "triggering event") indicate a potential impairment exists. We consider certain events and circumstances in determining whether a triggering event has occurred that could indicate
the carrying value of identifiable definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, may not be recoverable, including, but not limited to: (1) significant changes in performance
relative to expected operating results; (2) significant changes in the use of the assets; (3) significant negative industry or economic trends; (4) a significant decline in our
stock price for a sustained period of time; and (5) changes in our business strategy. If it is determined that a triggering event has occurred, we determine if an impairment exists based on an
estimate of the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows are lower than the carrying values of the related asset
group, an impairment exists and the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the group's assets exceeds the fair value of the asset group. We did not record an
impairment charge to any of our definite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2018, 2017, or 2016.

Assessment of Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets.

We are required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and, if current events or
circumstances require, on an interim basis. ASC Topic 350 provides companies an option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of
a reporting unit is less than its carrying value before performing a quantitative two-step approach to testing goodwill for impairment. We perform our impairment test for each reporting unit as part
of our annual impairment test performed as of December 31. The first step of the quantitative test measures for impairment by applying fair value-based tests at the reporting unit level. The
second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit.

To
determine the fair values of the reporting units used in the first step, we use a discounted cash flow approach. Each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of
significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include long-term growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates
based on our weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. These estimates and assumptions must be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment. Our estimates
for market growth, our market share and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, as well as on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and
estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. If future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require future impairment charges. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we
believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.

In
determining the fair value of our significant reporting units—namely Activision, Blizzard, and King—we assumed discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 9.5% and
terminal growth rates of 0.0% to 3.0%, depending on the reporting unit and its specific characteristics and risk profiles. Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined the estimated fair value
of all of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of December 31, 2018. Changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future
financial performance and changes in economic conditions, could result in future impairment charges.



We test our acquired trade names for possible impairment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. At December 31, 2018, 2017, and
2016, we concluded that no impairment had occurred and that no impairment was reasonably likely to occur. In determining the fair value of these trade names, we assumed a discount rate of 9.5%, and
royalty saving rates of approximately 1.5%. Changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic
conditions, could result in future impairment charges.

Share-Based Payments

We account for share-based payments in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10 and ASC Subtopic 505-50. Share-based compensation
expense for a given grant is recognized over the requisite service period (that is, the period for which the employee is being compensated) and is based on the value of share-based payment awards
after a reduction for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are
estimated at the time of grant and are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

We
generally estimate the value of stock options using a binomial-lattice model. This estimate is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex
and subjective variables, including our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.

We
generally determine the fair value of restricted stock units based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of the
estimated future dividends during the vesting period in which the restricted stock units holder will not participate. Certain restricted stock units granted to our employees and senior management vest
based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. For performance-based restricted stock units, each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified
performance criteria will be achieved. We amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock units over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each
separately vesting tranche of the award. For market-based restricted stock units, we estimate the fair value at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair
values over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of
market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is
rendered, the total fair value of the market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the
number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.

For
a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Below are the recently issued accounting pronouncements that were most significant to our accounting policy activities for fiscal 2018. For a
detailed discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Revenue Recognition

As discussed in Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, in May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition and on January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments
(collectively, the "new revenue accounting standard"), utilizing the modified retrospective method. Additionally, we elected to apply the new revenue accounting standard only to contracts not
completed as of the adoption date. For contracts that were modified before the period of adoption, we elected to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications when (1) identifying the
satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, (2) determining the transaction price, and (3) allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance
obligations. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue accounting standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has
not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The cumulative effect adjustment recorded to our retained earnings at January 1, 2018,
was $88 million.

The
most significant impacts of the new revenue accounting standard for us are:

•

The accounting for our sales of our games with significant online functionality for which we do not have vendor-specific objective
evidence ("VSOE") for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided.

Under the prior accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered
elements was required. This requirement was eliminated under the new revenue accounting standard. Accordingly, we are required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of
this software, as compared to recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated service period, as previously required. This difference in accounting primarily impacts revenues from most of
the titles within our Call of Duty franchise, where approximately 20% of the sales price is now recognized as revenue upon delivery of the games to our customers. The amount of revenue recognized upon
delivery of games to our customers is analyzed on a title-by-title basis and may change in the future. For example, the entire sales price from our

Call of Duty: Black Ops

release is being recognized ratably over an estimated service period, as the gameplay has an increased focus towards the online competitive and cooperative game modes with no
single-player campaign mode. Many of our other franchises, such as Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, are online hosted arrangements, and the accounting for our sales of these games under
the new standard is relatively unchanged; and

•

The accounting for certain of our software licensing arrangements.

While
the impact of the new revenue accounting standard may differ on a contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific
terms), the new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements.

For
additional discussion regarding the impact of our adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, including the impacts to our consolidated balance sheet and statement of
operations, see Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Statement of Cash Flows-Restricted Cash

In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard
requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with "Cash and cash
equivalents" when reconciling the beginning-of-period and



end-of-period
total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively.

We
adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented. The application of this new standard did not have a
material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. See Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for impacts on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Derivatives and Hedging

In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for derivatives and hedging. The new guidance expands and refines hedge
accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedged items in the financial statements, and
includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of a hedge's effectiveness. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the standard during the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact to our consolidated
financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP
guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use
asset for its leases. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease
payments. The asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a
straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2018. Adoption guidance provides for an optional adoption method that allows companies to use the effective date of the new lease standard as the initial date of application
on transition, and therefore does not require prior periods to be restated.

This
standard is effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2019, and we will report our adoption in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2019. Upon adoption, we will
elect to apply the available transition practical expedients, including the optional adoption method discussed above. We estimate the impact of adoption to result in the establishment of lease
liabilities of approximately $275 million to $325 million, with a similar corresponding impact to total assets. Additionally, we expect that the new disclosure requirements will require
us to design and implement additional internal controls over financial reporting, and we are in process of adjusting our processes and internal controls in preparation for adopting the new standard.

Item 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.



Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We transact business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates. Revenues and related expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in their respective local currencies. Primary currencies include euros,
British pounds, Australian dollars, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, and Swedish krona. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign
currency-denominated transactions will result in reduced revenues, operating expenses, net income, and cash flows from our international operations. Similarly, our revenues, operating expenses, net
income, and cash flows will increase for our international operations if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies. Since we have significant international sales, but incur the majority of
our costs in the United States, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business. We
monitor currency volatility throughout the year.

To
mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities, and earnings and our foreign currency risk related to functional
currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter into currency derivative contracts, principally forward contracts. These forward contracts generally
have a maturity of less than one year. The counterparties for our currency derivative contracts are large and reputable commercial or investment banks.

The
fair values of our foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period.

We
do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.

For
a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for our foreign currency forward contracts, see Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

At
December 31, 2018, our Cash Flow Hedges have remaining maturities of 12 months or less. Additionally, $11 million of net realized but unrecognized gains are
recorded within "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" at December 31, 2018, for Cash Flow Hedges that had settled but were deferred and will be amortized into earnings, along with the
associated hedged revenues. Such amounts will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.

For
the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, pre-tax net gains associated with these forward contracts were recorded in "General and administrative expenses" and were
not material.

In
the absence of hedging activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10% would have resulted in a
theoretical decline of our net income of approximately $140 million. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar;
however, all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in this manner and actual results may differ materially.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, as our outstanding debt is all at
fixed rates. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of money market funds and government securities with high credit quality and short average
maturities. Because short-term securities mature relatively quickly and must be reinvested at the then-current market rates, interest income on a portfolio consisting of cash, cash equivalents, or
short-term securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer-term securities. Conversely, the fair value of such a portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a
portfolio of longer-term securities. At December 31, 2018, our $4.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents was comprised primarily of money market funds.

The
Company has determined that, based on the composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018, there was no material interest rate risk exposure to the Company's
consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity as of that date.

Item 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Definition and Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the "Exchange Act are designed to
reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is: (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC's rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company
to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. Inherent limitations to any system of disclosure controls and procedures include, but are not limited to,
the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of such controls by one or more persons. In addition, we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we
believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, and our system of controls may therefore not achieve its desired objectives under all possible future events.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures at
December 31, 2018, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, at December 31,
2018, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our



management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness, as of December 31, 2018, of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2018.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated any changes in our
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that, at December 31, 2018, there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Activision Blizzard, Inc.:

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related
notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2), (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and
2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the COSO.

Change in Accounting Principles

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for revenues from
contracts with customers and the manner in which it accounts for restricted cash in the statement of cash flows in 2018.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are
a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.

Our
audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal

F-1


control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Description of Business

Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services on video
game consoles, personal computers ("PC"s), and mobile devices. We also operate esports leagues and events and create film and television content based on our intellectual property. The terms
"Activision Blizzard," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

The
Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. In connection with the 2008 business combination by and among the
Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A. ("Vivendi"), and Vivendi Games, Inc., then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi, we were renamed Activision
Blizzard, Inc.

The
common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol "ATVI."

The King Acquisition

On February 23, 2016 (the "King Closing Date"), we acquired King Digital Entertainment, a leading interactive mobile entertainment
company ("King"), by purchasing all of its outstanding shares (the "King Acquisition"), as further described in Note 23. Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of King
commencing on the King Closing Date.

Our Segments

Based upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments, as follows:

(i) Activision Publishing, Inc.

Activision Publishing, Inc. ("Activision") is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment
content, particularly for the console platforms. Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to
third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products primarily based on our internally developed intellectual properties, as
well as some licensed properties.

Activision's
key product franchise is Call of Duty

®

, a first-person shooter for the console and PC platforms.

In
2010, Activision entered into an exclusive relationship with Bungie, Inc. ("Bungie") to publish games in the Destiny franchise. Effective December 31, 2018, Activision and
Bungie mutually agreed to terminate their publishing relationship related to the Destiny franchise. As part of this termination, Activision agreed to transfer its publishing rights for the Destiny
franchise to Bungie in exchange for cash and Bungie's assumption of on-going customer obligations of Activision. Going forward, Activision no longer has any material rights or obligations related to
the Destiny franchise. As a result of the
agreement to terminate the relationship, the Company recognized revenues of $164 million and GAAP operating income of $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Consolidation and Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.

Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior-year amounts to conform to the current period presentation.

The
Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued, for additional evidence relative to certain
estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosures.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all money market funds and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
"Cash and cash equivalents."

Investment Securities

Investments in debt securities designated as available-for-sale are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such
securities, if available, or is estimated on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics. Unrealized gains and losses of the Company's available-for-sale
debt securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of "Other comprehensive income (loss)."

Investments
with original maturities greater than 90 days and remaining maturities of less than one year are normally classified within "Other current assets." In addition,
investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified within "Other current assets" if they are highly liquid in nature and represent the investment of cash that is available for current
operations.

The
specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed of, with realized gains and losses reflected in "Interest and other expense (income), net" in our
consolidated statements of operations.

Investments
in equity securities which are not accounted for under the equity method and for which there is not a readily determinable fair value are carried at cost, less impairment,
and adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investment of the same issuer.

Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of "Cash and cash equivalents," "Accounts receivable, net of allowances," "Accounts payable," and "Accrued expenses and
other liabilities" approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these accounts. Our investments in U.S. treasuries, government agency securities, and corporate bonds, if any, are carried at
fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such

F-10


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

securities,
if available, or is estimated on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics.

The
Company transacts business in various foreign currencies and has significant international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting us to foreign currency
risk. To mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and earnings and our foreign currency risk related to functional
currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter into currency derivative contracts, principally forward contracts. These forward contracts generally
have a maturity of less than one year. The counterparties for our currency derivative contracts are large and reputable commercial or investment banks.

We
assess the nature of these derivatives under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 815 to determine whether such derivatives
should be designated as hedging instruments. The fair value of foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the
period. We report the fair value of these contracts within "Other current assets," "Accrued expense and other liabilities," "Other assets," or "Other liabilities," as applicable, in our consolidated
balance sheets.

We
do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.

For
foreign currency forward contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815, changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives are recorded within
"General and administrative expenses" and "Interest and other expense, net" in our consolidated statements of operations, consistent with the nature of the underlying transactions.

For
foreign currency forward contracts which have been designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with ASC 815, we assess the effectiveness of these cash flow hedges at inception and
on an ongoing basis and determine if the hedges are effective at providing offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. The Company records the changes in the estimated fair value of these
derivatives in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" and subsequently reclassifies the related amount of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings within "General and administrative"
or "Net revenues" when the hedged item impacts earnings, consistent with the nature and timing of the underlying transactions. Cash flows from these foreign currency forward contracts are classified
in the same category as the cash flows associated with the hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows. We measure hedge ineffectiveness, if any, and if it is determined that a derivative
has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will discontinue hedge accounting for the derivative.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Our concentration of credit risk relates to depositors holding the Company's cash and cash equivalents and customers with significant accounts
receivable balances.

Our
cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in money market funds consisting of short-term, high-quality debt instruments issued by governments and governmental organizations,
financial institutions and industrial companies.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Our
customer base includes retailers and distributors, including mass-market retailers, first party digital storefronts, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game
specialty stores in the U.S. and other countries worldwide. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses. We generally do not require
collateral or other security from our customers.

For
the year ended December 31, 2018, we had three customers—Apple, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Inc. ("Sony"), and Google—who accounted for 15%,
13%, and 11%, respectively, of net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had three customers—Apple, Sony, and Google—who accounted for 16%, 14%, and 10%,
respectively, of net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had two
customers—Sony and Apple—who each accounted for 13% of net revenues. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in the respective periods discussed above.

We
had two customers—Sony and NetEase, Inc.—who accounted for 15% and 12%, respectively, of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2018. We
had three customers—Sony, Microsoft Corporation's ("Microsoft"), and Apple—who accounted for 17%, 14%, and 10%, respectively, of consolidated gross receivables at
December 31, 2017. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated gross receivables in the respective periods discussed above.

Inventories and Allowances for Obsolescence

Inventories consist of materials (including manufacturing royalties paid to console manufacturers), labor, and freight-in costs and are stated
at the lower of cost (weighted-average method) or net realizable value. Inventories are relieved on a weighted-average cost method.

We
regularly review inventory quantities on-hand and in the retail channels and will write down inventory on-hand based on excess or obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future
anticipated demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, which
are inherently difficult to assess and dependent on market conditions. At the point of a loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts
and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established basis.

Software Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses

Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs
incurred for internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable.
Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and tested product design and a working model. Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established and the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where
proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Software development costs related to online hosted revenue
arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project phase is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Prior
to a product's release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of

F-12


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

revenues—software
royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses." Capitalized costs for products that are canceled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to "Product
development" in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to "Product development."

Commencing
upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property
licenses" based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months to approximately two years.

Intellectual
property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks, copyrights, software, technology, music or other
intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our products. Depending upon the agreement with the rights holder, we may obtain the right to use the intellectual property in
multiple products over a number of years, or alternatively, for a single product. Prior to a product's release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as
part of "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses." Capitalized intellectual property costs for products that are canceled or are expected to
be abandoned are charged to "Product development" in the period of cancellation.

Commencing
upon a product's release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual
property licenses" based on the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed property will be utilized. As intellectual
property license contracts may extend for multiple years and can be used in multiple products to be released over a period beyond one year, the amortization of capitalized intellectual property
license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year.

We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior
periods, the primary evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the title to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, recoverability is
evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed
trademark or copyright is to be used. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology; market
performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to its release; general market conditions; and, for any sequel product, estimated performance based on the performance of the product on
which the sequel is based. Further, as many of our capitalized intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized
intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors, such as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property, whether there are any
future planned theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property, and the rights holder's continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property.

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of
expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted
amounts utilized in

F-13


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

the
initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Material differences may result
in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's expectations.

Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer

We apply the practical expedient to expense, as incurred, costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have
been one year or less for certain similar contracts in which commissions are paid to internal personnel or third parties. We believe application of the practical expedient has a limited effect on the
amount and timing of cost recognition. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial as of December 31, 2018.

Long-Lived Assets

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset
(i.e., 25 to 33 years for buildings, and 2 to 5 years for computer equipment, office furniture and other equipment). When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and
accumulated depreciation thereon are removed and any resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line
method over the estimated life of the asset, not to exceed the length of the lease. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Assets.

Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and is carried at cost. Acquired trade names are assessed as indefinite lived assets if there
is no foreseeable limits on the periods of time over which they are expected to contribute cash flows. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment
test, as well as between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We perform our annual impairment testing at December 31.

Our
annual goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. We test
goodwill for possible impairment by first determining the fair value of the related reporting unit and comparing this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The
fair value of our reporting units is determined using an income approach based on discounted cash flow models. In the event the recorded net assets of the reporting unit exceed the estimated fair
value of such assets, we perform a second step to measure the amount of the impairment, which is equal to the amount by which the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill after
assessing the fair value of each of the assets and liabilities within the reporting unit. We have determined that no impairment has occurred at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 based upon a
set of assumptions regarding discounted future cash flows, which represent our best estimate of future performance at this time.

We
test indefinite-lived acquired trade names for possible impairment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. We have determined that no impairment has occurred at

F-14


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

December 31,
2018, 2017, and 2016 based upon a set of assumptions regarding discounted future cash flows, which represent our best estimate of future performance at this time.

Changes
in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic conditions, could result in future
impairment charges.

Amortizable Intangible and Other Long-lived Assets.

Intangible assets subject to amortization are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, and amortized over the estimated useful life in
proportion to the economic benefits received.

We
evaluate the recoverability of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists. We consider
certain events and circumstances in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets, other than indefinite-lived intangible assets, may not be
recoverable including, but not limited to: significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results; significant changes in the use of the assets; significant negative industry or
economic trends; a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and changes in our business strategy. If we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we
estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset group to determine whether an impairment exists. If an impairment is indicated based on a
comparison of the asset groups' carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value.
We did not record an impairment charge to our definite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.

Revenue Recognition

In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard replaces all current U.S. GAAP
guidance on this topic, eliminating all industry-specific guidance and providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize
revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments (collectively, the "new revenue accounting standard"). This is reflected in our significant accounting policy
disclosure for revenue recognition below. Refer to Note 3 for the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.

We
generate revenue primarily through the sale of our interactive entertainment content and services, principally for the console, PC, and mobile platforms, as well as through the
licensing of our intellectual property. Our products span various genres, including first-person shooter, action/adventure, role-playing, strategy, and "match three." We primarily offer the following
products and services:

•

full games, which typically provide access to main game content, primarily for the console or PC platform;

•

downloadable content, which provides players with additional in-game content to purchase following the purchase of a full game;

F-15


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

•

microtransactions, which typically provide relatively small pieces of additional in-game content or enhancements to gameplay; and

•

subscriptions to players in our World of Warcraft franchise, which provide continual access to the game content.

When
control of the promised products and services is transferred to our customers, we recognize revenue in the amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange
for these products and services.

We
determine revenue recognition by:

•

identifying the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

•

identifying the performance obligations in each contract;

•

determining the transaction price;

•

allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in each contract; and

•

recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services.

Certain
products are sold to customers with a "street date" (which is the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we recognize revenues on the later
of the street date and the date the product is sold to our customer. For digital full-game downloads sold to customers, we recognize revenue when it is available for download or is activated for
gameplay. Revenues are recorded net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed at the time of the specific revenue-producing transaction between us and our customer, such as sales
and value-added taxes.

Payment
terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment immediately upon purchase or within 30 to 90 days. In instances where
the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when we expect, at
contract inception, that the period between our transfer of a promised product or service to our customer and payment for that product or service will be one year or less.

Product Sales

Product sales consist of sales of our games, including physical products and digital full-game downloads. We recognize revenues from the sale of
our products after both (1) control of the products has been transferred to our customers and (2) the underlying performance obligations have been satisfied.

Revenues
from product sales are recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the
amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and price protection are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available.

Sales
incentives and other consideration given by us to our customers, such as rebates and product placement fees, are considered adjustments of the transaction price of our products and
are reflected

reductions to revenues. Sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for distinct goods or services received, such as the appearance of our products in a customer's
national circular ad, are recorded as "Sales and marketing" expense when the benefit from the sales incentive is
separable from sales to the same customer and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service.

Products with Online Functionality

For our software products that include both offline functionality (i.e., do not require an Internet connection to access) and significant
online functionality, such as for most of our titles from the Call of Duty franchise, we evaluate whether the license of our intellectual property and the online functionality are distinct and
separable. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on, including downloadable content. If we determine that our software products contain a license of intellectual
property separate from the online functionality, we consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate the transaction price for the license, since we do not generally sell the
software license on a standalone basis. These products may be sold in a bundle with other products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations.

We
recognize revenue for arrangements that include both a license of intellectual property and separate online functionality when control of the license transfers to our customers for
the portion of the transaction price allocable to the license and ratably over the estimated service period for the portion of the transaction price allocable to the online functionality. Similarly,
we defer a portion of the cost of revenues on these arrangements and recognize the costs as the related revenues are recognized. The cost of revenues that are deferred include product costs,
distribution costs, and software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses, and excludes intangible asset amortization.

Online Hosted Software Arrangements

For our online hosted software arrangements, such as titles for the Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush franchises, substantially all
gameplay and functionality are obtained through our continuous hosting of the game content for the player. Similar to our software products with online functionality, these arrangements may include
other products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations. Revenues related to online hosted software arrangements are generally recognized ratably over
the estimated service period.

Subscription Arrangements

Subscription revenue arrangements are mostly derived from

World of Warcraft

, which is playable
through Blizzard's servers and is generally sold on a subscription-only basis. Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the
consumer and are then recognized ratably over the subscription period as the performance obligations are satisfied.

Revenues
attributable to the purchase of

World of Warcraft

software by our customers, including expansion packs, are classified as
"Product sales," whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and other in-game revenues are classified as "Subscription, licensing, and other revenues."

Licensing Revenues

In certain countries, we utilize third-party licensees to distribute and host our games in accordance with license agreements, for which the
licensees typically pay us a fixed minimum guarantee and sales-based royalties. These arrangements typically include multiple performance obligations, such as an upfront license of intellectual
property and rights to specified or unspecified future updates. Our estimate of the selling price is comprised of several factors including, but not limited to, prior selling prices, prices charged
separately by other third-party vendors for similar service offerings, and a cost-plus-margin approach. Based on the allocated transaction price, we recognize revenue associated with the minimum
guarantee (1) when we transfer control of the upfront license of intellectual property, (2) upon transfer of control of future specified updates, and/or (3) ratably over the
contractual term in which we provide the customer with unspecified future updates. Royalty payments in excess of the minimum guarantee are generally recognized when the licensed product is sold by the
licensee.

Other Revenues

Other revenues primarily include revenues from downloadable content (e.g., multi-player content packs), microtransactions, and licensing
of intellectual property other than software to third-parties.

Microtransaction
revenues are derived from the sale of virtual currencies and goods to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from these sales of virtual currencies
and goods are initially recorded in deferred revenue. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods purchased with a virtual currency.
Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods directly are similarly recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods. We categorize our virtual goods as either "consumable" or "durable."
Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed and
our performance obligation is satisfied. Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of
durable virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the player and our performance obligation is satisfied, which is generally the estimated service period.

Revenues
from the licensing of intellectual property other than software to third parties primarily include the licensing of our (1) brand, logo, or franchise to customers and
(2) media content. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our brand or franchise are generally recognized over the license term. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license
of our media content are generally recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which may be upfront or over time.

Significant Judgment around Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Determining whether products and services are
considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Certain of our games, such as titles in the Call of Duty
franchise, may contain a license of our intellectual property to play the game offline, but also depend on a significant level of integration and interdependency with the online functionality. In
these cases, significant judgment is required to determine whether this license of our intellectual property should be considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and

F-18


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

accounted
for together with the online functionality provided and recognized over time. Generally, for titles in which the software license is functional without the online functionality and a
significant component of gameplay is available offline, we believe we have separate performance obligations for the license of the intellectual property and the online functionality.

Significant
judgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation and to determine whether there is a discount that needs to be
allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of the various products and services. To estimate the standalone selling price we consider market data, including our pricing strategies for
the product being evaluated and other similar products we may offer, competitor pricing to the extent data is available, and costs to determine whether the estimated selling price yields an
appropriate profit margin.

Estimated Service Period

We consider a variety of data points when determining the estimated service period for players of our games, including the weighted average
number of days between players' first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average number of
days between players' first purchase date and last date played online. We also consider known online trends, the service periods of our previously released games, and, to the extent publicly
available, the service periods of our competitors' games that are similar in nature to ours. We believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of services to our customers, as it is the
best representation of the time period during which our customers play our games. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires management's judgment. Future usage patterns may
differ from historical usage patterns, and therefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service periods for players of our current games are generally less than
12 months.

Principal Agent Considerations

We evaluate sales of our products and content via third-party digital storefronts, such as Microsoft's Xbox Games Store, Sony's PSN, the Apple
App Store, and the Google Play Store, to determine whether revenues should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront. Key
indicators that we evaluate in determining whether we are the principal in the sale (gross reporting) or an agent (net reporting) include, but are not limited
to:

•

which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service; and

•

which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service.

Based
on our evaluation of the above indicators, we report revenues on a gross basis for sales arrangements via the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, and we report revenues on a
net basis (i.e., net of fees retained by the digital storefront) for sales arrangements via Microsoft's Xbox Games Store and Sony's PSN.

Allowances for Returns and Price Protection

We closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other publishers,
market conditions, and the anticipated timing of other releases to assess future demand of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent reorders are evaluated
with the goal of ensuring that quantities are sufficient to meet the demand from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel. We benchmark units
to be shipped to our customers using historical and industry data.

We
may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the circumstances in which we elect to
decrease, on a short- or longer-term basis, the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us
with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or receive price protection credits include, among other things,
compliance with applicable trading and payment terms and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell-through reports to us. We may also consider other factors, including achievement of
sell-through performance targets, the facilitation of slow-moving inventory, and other market factors.

Significant
management judgments and estimates with respect to potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product revenues must be made and used when
establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period. We estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for current period product revenues utilizing
historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer, and record revenue for the transferred products in the amount of
consideration to which we expect to be entitled. The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for a particular title: historical performance of titles
in similar genres; historical performance of the hardware platform; historical performance of the franchise; console hardware life cycle; sales force and retail customer feedback; industry pricing;
future pricing assumptions; weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory; absolute quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory; our warehouse on-hand inventory levels; the title's recent sell-through
history (if available); marketing trade programs; and the performance of competing titles. The relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other things, genre,
platform, seasonality, and sales strategy.

Based
upon historical experience, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. However, actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a
number of reasons, including, among others: a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor, or technological obsolescence due to
the emergence of new hardware platforms. There may be material differences in the amount and timing of our revenues for any period if factors or market conditions change or if matters resolve in a
manner that is inconsistent with management's assumptions utilized in determining the allowances for returns and price protection.

Contract Balances

We generally record a receivable related to revenue when we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment, and record deferred
revenue when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, even if amounts are refundable.

The
allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our accounts receivable balance. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we
analyze the age of current outstanding account balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes in our customers' payment terms
and their economic condition, as well as whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance. Any significant changes in any of these criteria would affect management's estimates in establishing our
allowance for doubtful accounts.

Deferred
revenue is comprised primarily of unearned revenue related to the sale of products with online functionality or online hosted arrangements. We typically invoice, and collect
payment for, these sales at the beginning of the contract period and recognize revenue ratably over the estimated service period. Deferred revenue also includes payments for: product sales pending
delivery or activation; subscription revenues; licensing revenues with fixed minimum guarantees; and other revenues for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control
of the product or service.

Refer
to Note 12 for further information, including changes in deferred revenue during the period.

Shipping and Handling

Shipping and handling costs consist primarily of packaging and transportation charges incurred to move finished goods to customers. We recognize
all shipping and handling costs as
an expense in "Cost of revenues-product costs," including those incurred when control of the product has already transferred to the customer.

Cost of Revenues

Our cost of revenues consist of the following:

Cost of revenues—product sales:

(1)

"Product
costs"—includes the manufacturing costs of goods produced and sold. These generally include product costs, manufacturing royalties (net of
volume discounts), personnel-related costs, warehousing, and distribution costs. We generally recognize volume discounts when they are earned (typically in connection with the achievement of
unit-based milestones).

(2)

"Software
royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses"—includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties attributable
to product sales revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are released, at which time the capitalized costs are amortized. Also included is amortization of
intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting attributable to product sales revenues.

F-21


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Cost of revenues—subscription, licensing, and other revenues:

(1)

"Game
operations and distribution costs"—includes costs to operate our games, such as customer service, Internet bandwidth and server costs, platform
provider fee, and payment provider fees, along with costs to associated with our esports activities.

(2)

"Software
royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses"—includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties attributable
to subscription, licensing and other revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are released, at which time the capitalized costs are amortized. Also
included is amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting attributable to subscription, licensing and other revenues.

Advertising Expenses

We expense advertising as incurred, except for production costs associated with media advertising, which are deferred and charged to expense
when the related advertisement is run for the first time. Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $631 million, $708 million, and
$641 million, respectively, and are included in "Sales and marketing" in the consolidated statements of operations.

Income Taxes

We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, the
provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability.
For those assets that do not meet the threshold of "more likely than not" that they will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.

We
report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any,
related to unrecognized tax benefits in "Income tax expense."

On
December 22, 2017, tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "U.S. Tax Reform Act") was enacted in the United States. The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other
things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposed a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of
foreign subsidiaries ("Transition Tax").

On
December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"), which provides guidance on how to account for the effects of the U.S. Tax
Reform Act under ASC 740. SAB 118 enabled companies to record a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment during a
measurement period of up to one year,

F-22


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

until
accounting is complete. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our analysis to determine the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. As a result, we made an election to record deferred U.S.
taxes with respect to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries subject to global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI"). Refer to Note 18 for further details regarding this policy election.

Excess
tax benefits and tax deficiencies are recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statement of operations and the tax effects of exercised or vested awards
are treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur.

Foreign Currency Translation

All assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries who have a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars
at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected as a
component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in shareholders' equity.

Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share

"Basic (loss) earnings per common share" is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. "Diluted earnings (loss) per common share" is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding, increased by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents are calculated using the treasury stock method and represent incremental
shares issuable upon exercise of our outstanding options. However, potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings (loss) per common share calculation when
inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded.

When
we determine whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities, unvested share-based awards which include the right to receive
non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents are considered to participate with common stock in undistributed earnings. With participating securities, we are required to calculate basic and
diluted earnings (loss) per common share amounts under the two-class method. The two-class method excludes from the earnings (loss) per common share calculation any dividends paid or owed to
participating securities and any undistributed earnings considered to be attributable to participating securities.

Share-Based Payments

We account for share-based payments in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10 and ASC Subtopic 505-50. Share-based compensation
expense for a given grant is recognized over the requisite service period (that is, the period for which the employee is being compensated) and is based on the value of share-based payment awards
after a reduction for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

We
generally estimate the value of stock options using a binomial-lattice model. This estimate is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex
and subjective

F-23


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

variables,
including our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.

We
generally determine the fair value of restricted stock units based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of the
estimated future dividends during the vesting period in which the restricted stock units holder will not participate. Certain restricted stock units granted to our employees and senior management vest
based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. For performance-based restricted stock units, each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified
performance criteria will be achieved. We amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock units over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each
separately vesting tranche of the award. For market-based restricted stock units, we estimate the fair value at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair
values over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of
market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is
rendered, the total fair value of the market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the
number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.

For
share-based compensation grants that are liability classified, we update our grant date valuation at each reporting period and recognize a cumulative catch-up adjustment for changes
in the value related to the requisite service already rendered.

Loss Contingencies

ASC Topic 450 governs the disclosure of loss contingencies and accrual of loss contingencies in respect of litigation and other claims. We
record an accrual for a potential loss when it is probable that a loss will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate of the potential loss is within a
range of amounts, the minimum of the range of potential loss is accrued, unless a higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range. Moreover, even if an
accrual is not required, we provide additional disclosure related to litigation and other claims when it is reasonably possible (i.e., more than remote) that the outcomes of such litigation and
other claims include potential material adverse impacts on us.

Revenue recognition

As noted in Note 2 above, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard effective January 1, 2018. We utilized the modified
retrospective method upon adoption and as a result, the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
Additionally, we elected to apply the new revenue accounting standard only to contracts not completed as of the adoption date. For contracts that were modified before the period of adoption, we
elected to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications when (1) identifying the

satisfied
and unsatisfied performance obligations, (2) determining the transaction price, and (3) allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance
obligations. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue accounting standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The cumulative effect
adjustment recorded to our retained earnings was $88 million (see our consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity) and included the impact from the following adjustments to our
consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2018 (amounts in millions):

The
most significant impacts of the new revenue accounting standard for us are:

•

The accounting for our sales of our games with significant online functionality for which we do not have vendor-specific objective
evidence ("VSOE") for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided.

Under the prior accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered
elements was required. This requirement was eliminated under the new revenue accounting standard. Accordingly, we are required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of
this software, as compared to recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated service period as previously required. This difference in accounting primarily impacts revenues from many of
the titles within our Call of Duty franchise, where approximately 20% of the sales price is now recognized as revenue upon delivery of the games to our customers. The amount of revenue recognized upon
delivery of games to our customers is analyzed on a title-by-title basis and may change in the future. For example, the entire sales price from our

Call of Duty: Black Ops

release is being recognized ratably over an estimated service period, as the gameplay has an increased focus towards the online competitive and cooperative game modes with no
single-player campaign mode. Many of our other franchises, such as Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, are online hosted arrangements, and the accounting for our sales of these games under
the new standard is relatively unchanged; and

•

The accounting for certain of our software licensing arrangements.

While
the impact of the new revenue accounting standard may differ on a contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific
terms), the new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements.

Adoption
of the new revenue accounting standard had no impact to net cash from or used in operating, investing, or financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

Financial Instruments

In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The new
standard, among other things, generally requires companies to measure investments in other entities, except those accounted for under the equity method, at fair value and to recognize any changes in
fair value in net income. For investments in entities without a readily determinable fair value, the new standard provides for a measurement alternative that can be elected to account for the
investments at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. The new
standard also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2017, and the guidance should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The guidance related to equity investments
without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) is applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. We adopted the new standard during
the first quarter of 2018, and elected to apply the
measurement alternative for our investments without a readily determinable fair value. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows-Restricted Cash

In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard
requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with "Cash and cash
equivalents" when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively.

We
adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented. The application of this new standard did not have a
material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, there is a significant impact to the
consolidated statements of cash flows, as this period included, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the release of cash in escrow to complete
the King Acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance is included in the beginning and ending cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, is not included as
an investing activity in the statement of cash flows. See a summary of impacts on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016 as follows (in millions):

Derivatives and Hedging

In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for derivatives and hedging. The new guidance expands and refines hedge
accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedged items in the financial statements, and
includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of a hedge's effectiveness. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the standard during the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact to our consolidated
financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP
guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use
asset for its leases. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease
payments. The asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a
straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense
pattern. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Adoption guidance provides for an optional adoption method
that allows companies to use the effective date of the new lease standard as the initial date of application on transition, and therefore does not require prior periods to be restated.

This
standard is effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2019, and we will report our adoption in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2019. Upon adoption, we will
elect to apply the available transition practical expedients, including the optional adoption method discussed above. We estimate the impact of adoption to result in the establishment of lease
liabilities of approximately $275 million to $325 million, with a similar corresponding impact to total assets. Additionally, we expect that the new disclosure requirements will require
us to design and implement additional internal controls over financial reporting, and we are in process of adjusting our processes and internal controls in preparation for adopting the new standard.

Goodwill

In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if an entity forgoes a Step 0
test, an entity will be required to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit, as determined in Step 1 from the goodwill impairment test,
with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge, if any, for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill
allocated to the reporting unit. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The effect
of adoption should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial
statements.

Cloud Computing Arrangements

In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance related to a customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing
arrangement (i.e. hosting arrangement) that is a service contract. The new guidance requires customers to capitalize implementation costs for these arrangements by applying the same criteria
that is utilized for existing internal-use software guidance. The capitalized costs are required to be amortized over the associated term of the arrangement, generally on a straight-line basis, with
amortization of these costs presented in the same financial statement line item as other costs associated with the arrangement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2019, and can be applied retrospectively or prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our
financial statements.

Included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" in our consolidated balance sheets are accrued payroll-related costs of $402 million and $441 million at
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the current portion of income taxes payable of $203 million and $162 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Included
in "Other liabilities" in our consolidated balance sheets are the non-current portion of income taxes payable of $272 million and $473 million at
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

11. Fair Value Measurements

The FASB literature regarding fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair
value. This hierarchy
requires entities to maximize the use of "observable inputs" and minimize the use of "unobservable inputs." The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as
follows:

•

Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

•

Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data; and

•

Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of
the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

Fair Value Measurements on a Non-Recurring Basis

We measure the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis, generally annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.

For
the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, there were no impairment charges related to assets that are measured on a non-recurring basis.

12. Deferred Revenues

We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of the fulfillment of our associated performance obligations. The opening balance of deferred revenues as of
January 1, 2018 and the ending balance as of December 31, 2018, were $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, including our current and non-current balances. For the
year ended December 31, 2018, the additions to our deferred revenues balance were primarily due to cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, while the
reductions to our deferred revenues balance were primarily due to the recognition of revenues upon fulfillment of our performance obligations, both of which were in the ordinary course of business.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, $1.7 billion of revenues were recognized that were included in the deferred revenues balance at the beginning of the period.

As
of December 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of contracted revenues allocated to our unsatisfied performance obligations is $2.9 billion, which includes our deferred
revenues balances and amounts to be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. We expect to recognize

approximately
$1.8 billion in 2019, $0.4 billion in 2020, and the remainder thereafter. This balance does not include an estimate for variable consideration arising from sales-based
royalty license revenue in excess of the contractual minimum guarantee.

13. Debt

Credit Facilities

At December 31, 2017, we had outstanding term loans "A" of approximately $990 million (the "2017 TLA") and $250 million
available under a revolving credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement entered into on October 11, 2013 (as amended thereafter and from time to time, the "Credit Agreement").

On
August 24, 2018, using available cash on hand, we made a voluntary prepayment of $990 million to fully repay and extinguish the 2017 TLA. As a result, we wrote-off
unamortized discount and financing costs of $7 million, which are included in "Loss on extinguishment of debt" in the consolidated statement of operations. On August 24, 2018, we also
entered into the seventh amendment (the "Amendment") to our Credit Agreement. The Amendment, among other things: (1) provided for a new revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal
amount of $1.5 billion (the "New Revolver"), which replaced our prior revolving credit facility; (2) amended the Credit Agreement to remove mechanics related to the 2017 TLA, which, as
noted above, was repaid in full prior to the effectiveness of the Amendment; and (3) eliminated or amended certain representations, warranties and covenants to reflect our current credit
ratings.

The
New Revolver is scheduled to mature on August 24, 2023. Borrowings under the New Revolver will bear interest, at the Company's option, at either (1) a base rate equal
to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate, plus 0.5%, (ii) the prime commercial lending rate of Bank of America, N.A. and (iii) the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") for
an interest period of one month beginning on such day plus 1.00%, or (2) LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable interest margin. LIBOR will be subject to a floor of 0% and base rate will be
subject to an effective floor of 1.00%. The applicable interest margin
for borrowings under the New Revolver will range from 0.875% to 1.375% for LIBOR borrowings and from 0% to 0.375% for base rate borrowings and will be determined by reference to a pricing grid based
on the Company's credit ratings. Up to $50 million of the New Revolver may be used for letters of credit. To date, we have not drawn on the New Revolver.

Under
the Credit Agreement, we are subject to a financial covenant requiring the Company's Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not to exceed 3.75:1.00
(or, at the Company's option and for a limited period of time upon the consummation of a Qualifying Acquisition (as defined in the Credit Agreement), 4.25:1.00). The Credit Agreement contains
covenants customary for transactions of this type for issuers with similar credit ratings. These include those restricting liens, debt of non-guarantor subsidiaries and certain fundamental changes, in
each case with exceptions, including exceptions for secured debt and debt of non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Company, in each case up to an amount not exceeding 7.5% of Total Assets (as defined in

Unsecured Senior Notes

At December 31, 2017, we had the following unsecured senior notes outstanding:

•

$750 million of 6.125% unsecured senior notes due September 2023 that we issued on September 19, 2013 (the "2023 Notes"), in a
private offering made in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act");

•

$650 million of 2.3% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the "2021 Notes") and $850 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes
due September 2026 (the "2026 Notes") that we issued on September 19, 2016, in a private offering made in accordance with Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act, and
subsequently exchanged for publicly registered notes in June 2017; and

•

$400 million of 2.6% unsecured senior notes due June 2022 (the "2022 Notes"), $400 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes due
June 2027 (the "2027 Notes"), and $400 million of 4.5% unsecured senior notes due June 2047 (the "2047 Notes", and together with the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the 2023 Notes, the 2026 Notes,
and the 2027 Notes, the "Notes"), that we issued on May 26, 2017, in a public underwritten offering.

On
July 17, 2018, we issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to the holders of all of our outstanding 2023 Notes. Accordingly, on August 16, 2018, using available cash
on hand, we redeemed the 2023 Notes in full at a redemption price equal to (1) 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes plus (2) a "make-whole" premium calculated as set forth in
the indenture governing the 2023 Notes and (3) accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The redemption of the 2023 Notes resulted in a "Loss on extinguishment of debt" recorded in
the consolidated statement of operations of $33 million, comprised of premium payments of $25 million and a write-off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of
$8 million. All other Notes referred to above remained outstanding as of December 31, 2018.

The
Notes are general senior obligations of the Company and rank

pari passu

in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and
future senior indebtedness, including the New Revolver described above. The Notes are not secured and are effectively junior to any of the Company's existing and future indebtedness that is secured to
the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The Notes contain customary covenants that place restrictions in certain circumstances on, among other things, the incurrence of
secured debt, entry into sale or leaseback transactions, and certain merger or consolidation transactions. We were in compliance with the terms of the Notes as of December 31, 2018.

Interest
is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year for the 2021 Notes, the 2023 Notes, and the 2026 Notes, and payable semi-annually in
arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year for the 2022 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2047 Notes. Accrued interest payable is recorded within "Accrued expenses and other
liabilities" in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had accrued interest payable of $15 million and $28 million,
respectively, related to the Notes.

We
may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2047 Notes prior to August 15, 2021, May 15, 2022, June 15,
2026, March 15, 2027, and December 15, 2046, respectively, and in each case at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal

amount
thereof plus a "make-whole" premium and accrued and unpaid interest. Any redemption of all or a portion of the applicable class of note after the applicable date would be at 100% of aggregate
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Upon
the occurrence of certain change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest. These repurchase requirements are considered clearly and closely related to the Notes and are not accounted for separately upon issuance.

Interest expense and financing costs

Fees and discounts associated with the issuance of our debt instruments are recorded as debt discount, which reduces their respective carrying
values, and are amortized over their respective terms. Amortization expense is recorded within "Interest and other expense (income), net" in our consolidated statement of operations.

For
the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016: interest expense was $134 million, $150 million, and $197 million, respectively; amortization of the
debt discount and deferred financing costs was $6 million, $12 million, and $20 million, respectively.

On
February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized repayment of up to $1.8 billion of the company's outstanding debt during 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had
utilized this entire authorization to repay our 2017 TLA and redeem our 2023 Notes, as described above.

Using
Level 2 inputs (i.e., observable market prices in less-than-active markets) at December 31, 2018, the carrying values of the 2021 Notes and the 2022 Notes
approximated their fair values, as the interest rates were similar to the current rates at which we could borrow funds over the selected interest periods. At December 31, 2018, based on
Level 2 inputs, the fair values of the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2047 Notes were $800 million, $376 million, and $360 million, respectively.

Using
Level 2 inputs at December 31, 2017, with the exception of the 2023 Notes and the 2047 Notes, the carrying values of our debt instruments approximated their
fair values. At December 31, 2017, based on Level 2 inputs, the fair values of the 2023 Notes and the 2047 Notes were $795 million and $421 million, respectively.

Income
taxes were not previously provided for foreign currency translation items, as these were considered indefinite investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Due to the U.S. Tax Reform Act
enacted on December 22, 2017, we re-evaluated our indefinite reinvestment assertions and no longer consider these items to be indefinite investments. The corresponding tax impact for this
change in assertion was not material.

15. Operating Segments and Geographic Regions

Currently, we have three reportable segments—Activision, Blizzard, and King. Our operating segments are consistent with the manner in which our operations are reviewed and
managed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of: the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related
cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; share-based compensation expense; amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting; fees and other
expenses (including legal fees, expenses, and accruals) related to acquisitions, associated integration activities, and financings; certain restructuring costs; and certain other non-cash charges. The
CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis, and accordingly, no disclosure is made with respect thereto.

Our
operating segments are also consistent with our internal organizational structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the availability of separate
financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments.

16. Share-Based Payments

Activision Blizzard Equity Incentive Plans

On June 5, 2014, the Activision Blizzard, Inc. 2014 Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan") became effective. Under the 2014 Plan, the
Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors is authorized to provide share-based compensation in the form of stock options, share appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
performance shares, and other performance- or value-based awards structured by the Compensation Committee within parameters set forth in the 2014 Plan. As of the

F-47


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

16. Share-Based Payments (Continued)

effective
date of the 2014 Plan, we had ceased making awards under our prior equity incentive plans (collectively, the "Prior Plans"), although such plans remain in effect to the extent that they
continue to govern outstanding awards.

While
the Compensation Committee has broad discretion to create equity incentives, our current share-based compensation program generally utilizes a combination of options and restricted
stock units. The majority of our options have time-based vesting schedules, generally vesting annually over a period of three to five years, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date.
In addition, under the terms of the 2014 Plan, the exercise price for the options must be equal to or greater than the closing
price per share of our common stock on the date the award is granted, as reported on Nasdaq. Restricted stock units have time-based vesting schedules, generally vesting in their entirety on an
anniversary of the date of grant, or vest annually over a period of three to five years, and may also be contingent on the achievement of specified performance measures.

As
of the date it was approved by our shareholders, there were 46 million shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. The number of shares of our common stock reserved for
issuance under the 2014 Plan has been, and may be further, increased from time to time by: (1) the number of shares relating to awards outstanding under any Prior Plan that: (i) expire,
or are forfeited, terminated or canceled, without the issuance of shares; (ii) are settled in cash in lieu of shares; or (iii) are exchanged, prior to the issuance of shares of our
common stock, for awards not involving our common stock; (2) if the exercise price of any option outstanding under any Prior Plans is, or the tax withholding requirements with respect to any
award outstanding under any Prior Plans are, satisfied by withholding shares otherwise then deliverable in respect of the award or the actual or constructive transfer to the Company of shares already
owned, the number of shares equal to the withheld or transferred shares; and (3) if a share appreciation right is exercised and settled in shares, a number of shares equal to the difference
between the total number of shares with respect to which the award is exercised and the number of shares actually issued or transferred. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately
27 million shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Shares issued in connection with awards made under the 2014 Plan are generally issued as new stock
issuances.

Additionally,
in connection with the King Acquisition, a majority of the outstanding options and awards with respect to King shares that were unvested as of the King Closing Date were
converted into equivalent options and awards with respect to shares of the Company's common stock. As part of the conversion, we assumed King's equity incentive plan (the "King Plan") and amended the
King Plan to convert it to a plan with respect to shares of the Company's common stock for the King shares assumed. No future shares can be granted from the King Plan, but it continues to govern
outstanding awards.

Fair Value Valuation Assumptions

Valuation of Stock Options

The fair value of stock options granted are principally estimated using a binomial-lattice model. The inputs in our binomial-lattice model
include expected stock price volatility,
risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, contractual term, and vesting schedule, as well as measures of employees' cancellations, exercise, and post-vesting termination behavior. Statistical methods
are used to estimate employee rank-specific termination rates.

Expected life

The
expected life of employee stock options is a derived output of the binomial-lattice model and represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected
to remain outstanding. A binomial-lattice model assumes that employees will exercise their options when the stock price equals or exceeds an exercise multiple. The exercise multiple is based on
historical employee exercise behaviors.

Volatility

To
estimate volatility for the binomial-lattice model, we consider the implied volatility of exchange-traded options on our stock to estimate short-term volatility, the
historical volatility of our common shares during the option's contractual term to estimate long-term volatility, and a statistical model to estimate the transition from short-term volatility to
long-term volatility.

Risk-free interest rate

As
is the case for volatility, the risk-free interest rate is assumed to change during the option's contractual term. The risk-free interest rate, which is based on
U.S. Treasury yield curves, reflects the expected movement in the interest rate from one time period to the next ("forward rate").

Dividend yield

The
expected dividend yield assumption is based on our historical and expected future amount of dividend payouts.

Share-based
compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and therefore has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time
of grant based on historical experience and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

F-49


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

16. Share-Based Payments (Continued)

Valuation of Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs")

The fair value of the Company's RSU awards granted is principally based upon the closing price of the Company's stock price on the date of grant
reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting.

Accuracy of Fair Value Estimates

We developed the assumptions used in the models above, including measures of employees' exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. Our
ability to accurately estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards at the grant date depends upon the accuracy of the model and our ability to accurately forecast model inputs for as long as
10 years into the future. These inputs include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility, risk-free rate, dividend yield, and employee termination rates. Although the fair value
of employee stock options is determined using an option-pricing model, the estimates that are produced by this model may not be indicative of the fair value observed between a willing buyer and a
willing seller. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine if
this is the case, as markets do not currently exist that permit the active trading of employee stock option and other share-based instruments.

The

period and the exercise price, times the number of shares for options where the closing stock price is greater than the exercise price) that would have been received by the option holders had all
option holders exercised their options on that date. This amount changes based on the market value of our stock. The total intrinsic value of options actually exercised was $196 million,
$372 million, and $161 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The total grant date fair value of options vested was $45 million,
$47 million, and $40 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

At
December 31, 2018, $84 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.20 years.

RSU Activity

We grant RSUs, which represent the right to receive shares of our common stock. Vesting for RSUs is contingent upon the holders' continued
employment with us and may be subject to other conditions (which may include the satisfaction of a performance measure). Also, certain of our performance-based RSUs include a range of shares that may
be released at vesting which are above or below the targeted number of RSUs based on actual performance relative to the grant date performance measure. If the vesting conditions are not met, unvested
RSUs will be forfeited. Upon vesting of the RSUs, we may withhold shares otherwise deliverable to satisfy tax withholding requirements.

The
following table summarizes our RSU activity with performance-based RSUs presented at the maximum potential shares that could be earned and issued at vesting (amounts in thousands
except per share amounts):

Certain
of our performance-based RSUs did not have an accounting grant date as of December 31, 2018, as there is not a mutual understanding between the Company and the employee of
the
performance terms. Generally, these performance terms relate to operating income performance for future years where the performance goals have not yet been set. As of December 31, 2018, there
were 3.2 million performance-based RSUs outstanding for which the accounting grant date has not been set, of which 1.6 million were 2018 grants. Accordingly, no grant date fair value was
established and the weighted average grant date fair value calculated above for 2018 grants excludes these RSUs.

At
December 31, 2018, approximately $98 million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to RSUs and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of 1.51 years. Of the total unrecognized compensation cost, $67 million was related to performance-based RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.49 years. The total grant date fair value of vested RSUs was $120 million, $64 million and $123 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016,
respectively.

The
income tax benefit from stock option exercises and RSU vestings was $94 million, $160 million, and $134 million for the years ended December 31, 2018,
2017, and 2016, respectively.

ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

18. Income Taxes (Continued)

The
Company's tax rate is affected by the tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, some of which have a statutory tax rate less than the U.S. rate of 21% , and the
relative amount of income earned in each jurisdiction.

On
June 27, 2018, we entered into a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to resolve certain intercompany transfer pricing arrangements for tax periods
starting in 2009 (the "Closing Agreement"). The primary adjustments related to the Closing Agreement were recognized in the second quarter of 2018 and consisted of a tax expense of $70 million
and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $437 million. In addition, we recognized $185 million of tax benefits related to other tax adjustments resulting from the changes in U.S.
tax attributes and taxable income caused by the primary adjustments. The Closing Agreement resulted in federal and state cash tax payments totaling approximately $345 million, of which federal
tax payments of $334 million were made in October 2018.

On
December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, beginning in
2018, and implemented the Transition Tax.

On
December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"), which provides guidance on how to
account for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act under ASC 740. SAB 118 enabled companies to record a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable
estimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year, until accounting is complete. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional amounts of $636 million
for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act in accordance with SAB 118. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we no longer considered the available cash balances related to undistributed
earnings held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested.

In
the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our analysis of the effect of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an additional tax benefit of
$285 million for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. This is primarily related to the election to record deferred U.S. taxes with respect to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries subject to
global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") and the adjustment for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the U.S. corporate income tax rate reduction. The
aggregate U.S. Tax Reform Act impact for 2017 and 2018 is a net tax expense of $351 million, which consists of a $570 million tax expense related to the Transition Tax partially offset
by a net benefit of $219 million, mainly related to the adoption of GILTI deferred tax accounting and remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

In
2013, in connection with the October 11, 2013 repurchase of approximately 429 million shares of our common stock from Vivendi ("Purchase Transaction"), we assumed
certain tax attributes, generally consisting of net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards of approximately $760 million, which represent a potential tax benefit of approximately
$266 million. The Company also obtained indemnification from Vivendi against losses attributable to the disallowance of claimed utilization of such NOL carryforwards of up to
$200 million in unrealized tax benefits in the aggregate, limited to taxable years ending on or prior to December 31, 2016. No benefit for these tax attributes or indemnification was
recorded upon the close of the Purchase Transaction. As of December 31, 2017, we had utilized approximately $760 million of the original NOL and had recorded an indemnification asset

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

of
$200 million in "Other assets." Correspondingly, the same amount was recorded as a reduction to the consideration paid for the shares repurchased in "Treasury stock."

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the amounts used for income tax
purposes. The components of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows (amounts in millions):

As
of December 31, 2018, we had gross tax credit carryforwards of $172 million for state purposes. The tax credit carryforwards are presented in "Deferred tax assets" net
of unrealized tax benefits that would apply upon the realization of uncertain tax positions. In addition, we had foreign NOL carryforwards of $22 million at December 31, 2018, attributed
mainly to losses in France which can be carried forward indefinitely.

We
evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability. We record a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet the threshold of "more likely than not" to be realized in the
future. To make
that determination, we evaluate the likelihood of realization based on the weight of all positive and negative evidence available. As of December 31, 2017, we had a deferred tax asset for
California research and development credit carryforwards ("CA R&D Credits"), which can be carried forward indefinitely. The Closing Agreement impacts historical and prospective filings in certain
states, including California, and after considering the impact of the Closing Agreement on its prospective California taxable income, we determined that our remaining CA R&D Credits no longer met the
threshold of more likely than not to be realized in the future. As such, for the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a full valuation allowance of $61 million. We will reassess
this determination quarterly and record a tax benefit if and when future evidence allows for a partial or full release of this valuation allowance.

18. Income Taxes (Continued)

As of December 31, 2017, we no longer consider the available cash balances related to undistributed earnings held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries to be
indefinitely reinvested. As of December 31, 2018, we recorded net deferred tax liability related to undistributed foreign earnings of $16 million. In addition, we have elected to record
deferred U.S. taxes with respect to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries subject to GILTI and recorded a $263 million deferred tax asset.

Activision
Blizzard's 2009 through 2017 tax years remain open to examination by certain major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject. During February 2018, we were notified by the
IRS that our tax returns for our 2012 through 2016 tax years will be subject to examination. In September 2018, the IRS concluded its examination of our 2009 through 2011 tax years. We also have
several state and non-U.S. audits pending, including the French and Swedish audits discussed below. In addition, as part of purchase price accounting for our 2016 acquisition of King, we assumed
$74 million of uncertain tax positions primarily related to pre-acquisition transfer pricing matters. We are currently in negotiations with the tax authorities in the relevant jurisdictions,
which include the UK and Sweden, with respect to King's transfer pricing for both pre- and post-acquisition tax years. While the outcome of these negotiations remains uncertain, they could result in
an agreement that changes the allocation of profits and losses between these and other relevant jurisdictions or a failure to reach an agreement that results in unilateral adjustments to the amount
and timing of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which King operates.

In
December 2018, we received a decision from the Swedish Tax Agency ("STA") informing us of an audit assessment to a Swedish subsidiary of King for the 2016 tax year. The STA decision
described the basis for issuing a transfer pricing assessment of approximately 3.5kr billion (approximately $400 million), primarily concerning an alleged intercompany asset transfer. We
disagree with the STA's decision and intend to vigorously contest it. We plan to pursue all remedies available to us to successfully resolve the matter, including administrative remedies with the STA,
multilateral procedures with other relevant taxing jurisdictions, and, if necessary, judicial remedies. Further, we may be required to pay the full assessment to the STA in advance of the final
resolution of the matter. While we believe our tax provisions at December 31, 2018, are appropriate, until such time as this matter is ultimately resolved we could be subject to significant
additional tax liabilities.

In
December 2017, we received a Notice of Reassessment from the French Tax Authority ("FTA") related to transfer pricing for intercompany transactions involving one of our French
subsidiaries for the 2011 through 2013 tax years. The total assessment, including penalties and interest, was approximately €571 million (approximately $652 million). We
disagree with the proposed assessment and intend to vigorously contest it. We plan to pursue all remedies available to us to successfully resolve this matter, including administrative remedies with
the FTA and, if necessary, judicial remedies. While we believe our tax provisions at December 31, 2018, are appropriate, until such time as this matter is ultimately resolved we could be
subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition to the risk of additional tax for the 2011 through 2013 tax years, if litigation regarding this matter were adversely determined and/or
if the FTA were to seek adjustments of a similar nature for subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.

In
addition, certain of our subsidiaries are under examination or investigation, or may be subject to examination or investigation, by tax authorities in various jurisdictions. These
proceedings may lead to adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or provisions for uncertain tax positions. Such proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated
financial position,

liquidity,
or results of operations in the earlier of the period or periods in which the matters are resolved and in which appropriate tax provisions are taken into account in our financial
statements. If we were to receive a materially adverse assessment from a taxing jurisdiction, we would plan to vigorously contest it and consider all of our options, including the pursuit of judicial
remedies.

As
of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $917 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $812 million of which would affect our effective tax rate, if
recognized. A reconciliation of total gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (amounts in millions):

As
of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had approximately $87 million, $121 million, and $71 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties
related to uncertain tax positions. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we recorded $11 million, $28 million, and $17 million, respectively, of interest
expense related to uncertain tax positions.

The
final resolution of the Company's global tax disputes is uncertain. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of disputes, including the probability determination and
estimation of the potential exposure. Based on current information, in the opinion of the Company's management, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations, except as noted above.

In
2016, certain of our unvested restricted stock units met the definition of participating securities, as they participated in earnings based on their rights to dividends or dividend
equivalents. Therefore, we were required to use the two-class method in our computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share. For the year ended December 31, 2016, on a
weighted-average basis, we had
outstanding unvested restricted stock units of 3 million shares of common stock that participated in earnings.

The
vesting of certain of our employee-related restricted stock units and options is contingent upon the satisfaction of pre-defined performance measures. The shares underlying these
equity awards are included in the weighted-average dilutive common shares only if the performance measures are met as of the end of the reporting period. Approximately 4 million,
7 million, and 8 million shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, as
their underlying performance measures had not yet been met.

Potential
common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per common share calculation when the inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive. Therefore,
3 million, 1 million, and 5 million options to purchase shares of common stock were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

20. Capital Transactions

Repurchase Programs

On January 31, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to
$1.5 billion of our common stock from February 14, 2019 until the earlier of February 13, 2021 and a determination by the Board of Directors to discontinue the repurchase program.

On
February 2, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we were authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock from
February 13, 2017 through February 12, 2019. We did not repurchase any shares under this program.

Dividends

On February 12, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.37 per common share. Such dividend is payable on
May 9, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 28, 2019.

On
February 8, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per common share. On May 9, 2018, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of
$259 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2018.

On
February 9, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share. On May 10, 2017, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of
$226 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2017. On May 26, 2017, we made related dividend equivalent payments of less than $1 million to
certain holders of restricted stock units.

On
February 11, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per common share. On May 11, 2016, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of
$192 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2016. On May 27, 2016, we made related dividend equivalent payments of $3 million to certain
holders of restricted stock units.

22. Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments and Obligations

In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for non-cancelable operating lease agreements for
our offices, for the development of products and for the rights to intellectual property. Under these agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor, developer or intellectual
property holder, as the case may be, based upon contractual arrangements. The payments to third-party developers are generally conditioned upon the achievement by the developers of contractually
specified development milestones. Further, these payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders typically are deemed to be advances and, as such, are recoupable against future
royalties earned by the developer or intellectual property holder based on sales of the related game. Additionally, in connection with certain intellectual property rights, acquisitions and
development agreements, we commit to spend specified amounts for marketing support for the game(s) which is (are) to be developed or in which the intellectual property will be utilized. Assuming all
contractual provisions are met, the total future minimum commitments for these and other contractual arrangements in place at December 31, 2018, are scheduled to be paid as follows (amounts in
millions):

We
have omitted uncertain income tax liabilities from this table due to the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of the potential issue resolution of the
underlying matters. Specifically, either (a) the underlying positions have not been fully developed under audit to quantify at this time or, (b) the years relating to the matters for
certain jurisdictions are not currently under audit. At December 31, 2018, we had $637 million of net unrecognized tax benefits included "Other liabilities," in our consolidated balance
sheet.

Additionally,
as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform Act, we recorded a liability at December 31, 2017, of $467 million which reflected our estimated Transition Tax net payments. In the
fourth quarter of

2018,
we completed our analysis of the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act and adjusted the net Transition Tax liability with consideration of tax attributes utilization to be $198 million. The
Transition Tax liability is payable over and up to an eight-year period and is not reflected in our Contractual Obligations table above.

Long-term
debt obligations represent our obligations related to the contractual principal repayments and interest payments under the Notes, which are subject to
fixed interest rates, as of December 31, 2018. There was no outstanding balance under our New Revolver as of December 31, 2018. We have calculated the expected interest obligation based
on the outstanding principal balance and interest rate applicable at December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on our debt obligations.

Legal Proceedings

In December 2018, we received a decision from the STA informing us of an audit assessment to a Swedish subsidiary of King for the 2016 tax year.
The STA decision described the basis for issuing a transfer pricing assessment of approximately 3.5kr billion (approximately $400 million)
primarily concerning an alleged intercompany asset transfer. We disagree with the STA's decision and intend to vigorously contest it. We plan to pursue all remedies available to us to successfully
resolve the matter, including administrative remedies with the STA, multilateral procedures with other relevant taxing jurisdictions, and, if necessary, judicial remedies. Further, we may be required
to pay the full assessment to the STA in advance of the final resolution of the matter. While we believe our tax provisions at December 31, 2018, are appropriate, until such time as this matter
is ultimately resolved we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.

In
December 2017, we received a Notice of Reassessment from the FTA related to transfer pricing for intercompany transactions involving one of our French subsidiaries for the 2011
through 2013 tax years. The total assessment, including penalties and interest, was approximately €571 million (approximately $652 million). We disagree with the proposed
assessment and intend to vigorously contest it. We plan to pursue all remedies available to us to successfully resolve this matter, including administrative remedies with the FTA and, if necessary,
judicial remedies. While we believe our tax provisions at December 31, 2018, are appropriate, until such time as this matter is ultimately resolved we could be subject to significant additional
tax liabilities. In addition to the risk of additional tax for the 2011 through 2013 tax years, if litigation regarding this matter were adversely determined and/or if the FTA were to seek adjustments
of a similar nature for subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.

In
addition, we are party to routine claims, suits, investigations, audits, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to intellectual
property, competition and antitrust matters, regulatory matters, tax matters, privacy matters, labor and employment matters, compliance matters, unclaimed property matters, liability and personal
injury claims, product damage claims, collection matters, and/or commercial claims. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, such routine claims and lawsuits are not
significant and we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Letters of Credit

As described in Note 13, a portion of our New Revolver can be used to issue letters of credit of up to $50 million, subject to the
availability of the New Revolver. At December 31, 2018, we did not have any letters of credit issued or outstanding under the New Revolver.

23. Acquisitions

King Digital Entertainment

On February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition, purchasing all of King's outstanding shares. As a result, King became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Activision Blizzard. King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, primarily on mobile platforms, such as Android and
iOS, and on online and social platforms, such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King's results of operations since the King Closing Date are included in our consolidated financial statements.

We
made this acquisition because we believed that the addition of King's highly-complementary mobile business positioned the Company as a global leader in interactive entertainment
across the console, PC, and mobile platforms, and aligned us for future growth.

The
aggregate purchase price of the King Acquisition was approximately $5.8 billion, which was paid on the King Closing Date and funded primarily with $3.6 billion of
existing cash and $2.2 billion of cash from new debt issued by the Company. We identified and recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values at the King Closing
Date, and allocated the remaining value of approximately $2.7 billion to goodwill.

During
the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $38 million of expenses related to the King Acquisition, which are included within "General and
administrative" in the consolidated statements of operations.

Share-Based Compensation

In connection with the King Acquisition, a majority of the outstanding King options and other equity awards that were unvested as of the King
Closing Date were converted into equivalent options and awards with respect to shares of the Company's common stock, using an equity award exchange ratio calculated in accordance with the transaction
agreement. As a result, replacement options and other equity awards of 10 million and 3 million, respectively, were issued. The portion of the fair value related to pre-combination
services of $76 million was included in the purchase price.

The
remaining portion of outstanding unvested awards that were assumed were replaced with deferred cash awards. The cash proceeds were placed in an escrow-like account with the cash
releases to occur based on the awards' original vesting schedule upon future service being rendered. The portion of the fair value related to pre-combination services of $22 million was
included in the purchase price.

Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired and Goodwill

The internally-developed franchises, customer base, developed software, and trade name intangible assets from the acquisition of King will be
amortized to "Cost of revenues—subscription, licensing, and

F-63


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

other
revenues—Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses," "Sales and marketing," "Cost of revenues—subscription, licensing, and other
revenues—Software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses," and "General and administrative," respectively. The intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated
useful lives in proportion to the economic benefits received.

The
$2.7 billion of goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to the benefits the Company expects to derive from accelerated expansion as an interactive entertainment provider
in the mobile sector, future franchises, and technology, as well as the management team's proven ability to create future games and franchises. Approximately $464 million of the goodwill is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes in the U.S.

25. Subsequent Events

Focusing Development Resources and Restructuring Plan:

In order to better capitalize on long-term growth opportunities, on
February 12, 2019,
the Company committed to a Board-authorized restructuring plan under which the Company plans to refocus its resources on its largest opportunities and to remove unnecessary levels of complexity and
duplication from certain parts of the business. More specifically, we intend to:

•

increase our investment in development for our largest, internally-owned franchises—across upfront releases, in-game content,
mobile and geographic expansion;

F-65


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

25. Subsequent Events (Continued)

•

reduce certain non-development and administrative-related costs across our business; and

•

integrate our global and regional sales and "go-to-market," partnerships, and sponsorships capabilities across the business, which we believe
will enable us to provide better opportunities for talent, and greater expertise and scale on behalf of our business units.

We
expect to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $150 million in 2019, related to severance, including, in many cases, above legally required amounts
(approximately 65% of the aggregate charge), facilities costs (approximately 20% of the aggregate charge), and asset write-downs and other costs (approximately 15% of the aggregate charge). We expect
the majority of these charges to be incurred in the first quarter of 2019, with most of the balance expected to be incurred in the remainder of 2019. The total pre-tax charge associated with the
restructuring will be paid almost entirely in cash and the outlays are expected to be incurred throughout 2019.
