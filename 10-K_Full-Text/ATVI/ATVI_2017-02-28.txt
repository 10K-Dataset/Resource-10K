Item 1.    BUSINESS

Overview

Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and
distribute content and services across all of the major gaming platforms, including video game consoles, personal computers ("PC"), and mobile devices. The terms "Activision Blizzard," the "Company,"
"we," "us," and "our" are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

The
Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. We are the result of the 2008 business combination (the "Business
Combination") by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A. ("Vivendi"), and Vivendi Games, Inc. ("Vivendi Games"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of Vivendi. In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, Activision, Inc., was renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc.

The
common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol "ATVI."

The King Acquisition

On February 23, 2016 (the "King Closing Date"), we acquired King Digital Entertainment, a leading interactive mobile entertainment
company ("King"), by purchasing all of its outstanding shares (the "King Acquisition"). We made this acquisition because we believe that the addition of King's



highly
complementary mobile business positions the Company as a global leader in interactive entertainment across mobile, console, and PC platforms, as well as positioning us for future growth. The
aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion was funded with $3.6 billion of existing cash and $2.2 billion of cash from new debt issued by the Company. King's results
of operations since the King Closing Date are included in our consolidated financial statements.

Our Strategy and Vision

Our objective is to continue to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of high-quality interactive entertainment
content and services and other media that deliver year-round, highly satisfying and engaging entertainment experiences. In pursuit of this objective we focus on three strategic pillars: expanding
audience reach; driving deep consumer engagement; and providing more opportunities for player investment.

Expanding audience reach.

Building on our strong established franchises and creating new franchises through compelling new content is
at the core of
our business. Our employees, technology, and institutionalized processes allow us to continue to deliver high-quality content that expands our reach.
We endeavor to reach as many consumers as possible either through: (1) the purchase of our content and services; (2) engagement in our free-to-play games, which allow consumers to play
games with no up-front cost but are instead monetized through sales of downloadable content or via microtransactions; or (3) engagement in other types of media based on our franchises.

Driving deep consumer engagement.

Our high-quality entertainment content not only expands our audience reach, but it also drives deep
engagement with
our franchises. We design our games and other forms of media to provide a depth of content that keeps consumers playing and engaged for a long period of time following a game's release, delivering
value to our players and additional growth opportunities for our franchises.

Providing more opportunities for player investment.

Increasingly, our consumers engage in our content year-round and are connected to
our games
online through mobile devices, connected consoles, and PCs. This allows us to offer additional digital player investment opportunities directly to the consumers. In addition to purchasing full games
or subscriptions, players can invest in certain of our games and franchises by purchasing incremental "in-game" content (including larger downloadable content or smaller content, via
microtransactions). These digital revenue streams tend to be recurring and have higher profit margins. Further, if executed properly, additional player investment can increase engagement as it
provides more frequent and incremental content for our players. In addition, we believe there is an opportunity for advertising within certain of our franchises, as well as opportunities to drive new
forms of player investment through esports, film and television, and consumer products. We are in the early stages of developing these new revenue streams.

Our
strategy is ultimately aimed at creating shareholder value and enhancing returns. We strive to increase profitability, cash flows, and return on capital—and to do so
while keeping our company a great place to work for our employees.

Reportable Segments

Based on our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable operating segments as follows:

(i)    Activision Publishing, Inc.

Activision Publishing, Inc. ("Activision"), is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content,
particularly in console gaming. Activision primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads, including full-game sales and in-game



purchases,
as well as licenses of software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets and sells products which are principally based on
our internally developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties. Additionally, we have established a long-term alliance with Bungie to publish its game universe, Destiny.

Activision's
key product franchises include: Call of Duty®, a first-person shooter for the console and PC platforms; Destiny, an online universe of first-person action
gameplay (which we call a "shared-world shooter") for console platforms; and Skylanders®, a kid's game franchise that brings physical toys to life digitally in the game primarily for
console platforms. Call of Duty, Activision's leading franchise, was the number one console franchise globally in 2016, and in North America for the 8th year in a row, according to The NPD
Group, GfK Chart-Track, and our internal estimates.

(ii)   Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.

Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. ("Blizzard") is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content,
particularly in PC gaming. Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads, including subscriptions, full-game sales, and in-game purchases, as well as licenses of
software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard
content, online social connectivity across all Blizzard games, and the creation of user-generated content for Blizzard's games.

Blizzard's
key product franchises include: World of Warcraft®, a subscription-based massive multi-player online role-playing game ("MMORPG") for the PC;
StarCraft®, a real-time strategy PC franchise; Diablo®, an action role-playing franchise for PC and console platforms; Hearthstone®, an online collectible card
franchise for the PC and mobile platforms; Heroes of the Storm®, a free-to-play team brawler for the PC; and Overwatch®, a team-based first person shooter for the PC and
console platforms. World of Warcraft is the leading subscription-based MMORPG and was initially launched in November 2004.

(iii)  King Digital Entertainment

King Digital Entertainment ("King") is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly on mobile
platforms, such as Android and iOS. King also distributes its content and services on online social platforms, such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King's games are free-to-play, however
players can acquire in-game virtual items, either with virtual currency the players purchase, or directly using real currency.

King's
key product franchises, all of which are for the PC and mobile platforms, include: Candy Crush™, which features "match three" games; Farm Heroes™, which
also features "match three" games; Pet Rescue™, which is a "clicker" game; and Bubble Witch™, which features "bubble shooter" games. King had two of the top 10 highest-grossing
titles in the United States of America ("U.S.") mobile app stores for the last thirteen quarters in a row, according to App Annie Intelligence and internal estimates for Apple App Store and Google
Play Store combined.

(iv)  Other

We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:

•

The Major League Gaming ("MLG") business (which we formerly referred to as Activision Blizzard Media Networks or Media Networks), which is
devoted to esports and builds on our competitive gaming efforts by creating ways to deliver a best-in-class fan experience across games, platforms, and geographies with a long-term strategy of
monetization through advertising, sponsorships, tournaments, and premium content.



•

The Activision Blizzard Studios ("Studios") business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of
globally recognized intellectual properties, and, in October 2016, released the first season of the animated TV series

Skylanders™ Academy

on Netflix.

•

The Activision Blizzard Distribution ("Distribution") business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and
sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Products

We develop content and services principally for console, PC, and mobile devices, and we market and sell our games through retail and digital
distribution channels. We develop products spanning various genres, including first-person shooter, action/adventure, role-playing, strategy, and "match three," among others. We primarily offer the
following products and services:

•

Full-games, which typically provide access to main game content, primarily for console or PC.

•

Downloadable content, which provides players with additional in-game content to purchase following the purchase of a full game.

•

Microtransactions, which typically provide relatively small pieces of additional in-game content or enhancements to gameplay, generally at
relatively low price points.

•

Subscriptions for players in our World of Warcraft franchise that provide for continual access to the game content.

Providing
additional opportunities for player investment outside of full-game purchases has allowed us to shift from our historical seasonality to a more recurring and year-round revenue
model. In addition, if executed properly, it allows us to increase player engagement as it provides more frequent and incremental content for our players.

Product Development and Support

We focus on developing enduring franchises backed by well-designed, high-quality games with regular content updates. We build content with the
potential for broad reach, sustainable engagement and year-round player investment. It is our experience that enduring franchises then serve as the basis for sequels, prequels and related new products
and content that can be released over an extended period of time. We believe that the development and distribution of products and content based on proven franchises enhances predictability of
revenues and the probability of high unit volume sales and operating profits. We intend to continue development of owned franchises in the future.

We
develop and produce our titles using a model in which a group of creative, production, and technical professionals, including designers, producers, programmers, artists, and sound
engineers, in coordination with our marketing, finance, analytics, sales, and other professionals, has responsibility for the entire development and production process, including the supervision and
coordination of internal and, where appropriate, external resources. We believe this model allows us to deploy the best resources for a given task, by supplementing our internal expertise with
top-quality external resources on an as-needed basis.

While
most of the content for our franchises is developed by internal studios, we periodically engage independent third-party developers to create content on our behalf. From time to
time, Activision also acquires the license rights to publish and/or distribute software products that are, or will be, independently created by third-party developers. Since 2010, Activision has been
in a long-term exclusive relationship with Bungie, the developer of game franchises including Halo, Myth and



Marathon,
to publish games in the Destiny franchise. During the term of the agreement, Activision has exclusive, worldwide rights to publish and distribute on multiple platforms all future Bungie
games based on Destiny.

We
provide various forms of product support. Central technology and development teams review, assess, and provide support to products throughout the development process. Quality
assurance personnel are also involved throughout the development and production of published content. We subject all such content to extensive testing before public release to ensure compatibility
with appropriate hardware systems and configurations and to minimize the number of bugs and other defects found in the products. To support our content, we generally provide 24-hour game support to
players through various means, primarily online and by telephone.

Marketing, Sales, and Distribution

Many of our products contain software that enables us to connect with our gamers directly. This provides a significant marketing tool that
allows us to communicate and market directly to our customers, including through customized advertising and in-game messaging based on customer preferences and trends. Our marketing efforts also
include activities on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other online social networks, other online advertising, other public relations activity, print and broadcast advertising, coordinated in-store and
industry promotions (including merchandising and point of purchase displays), participation in cooperative advertising programs, direct response vehicles, and product sampling through demonstration
software distributed through the Internet or the digital online services provided by our partners. From time to time, we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers, producers of
consumer products related to a game, and retailers in connection with their own promotional efforts.

Our
physical products are available for sale in outlets around the world. These products are sold primarily on a direct basis to mass-market retailers (e.g., Target, Wal-Mart),
consumer electronics stores (e.g., Best Buy), discount warehouses, game specialty stores (e.g., GameStop), and other stores (e.g., Amazon, Toys "R" Us) or through third-party
distribution and licensing arrangements.

Most
of our products and content are also available in a digital format, which allows consumers to purchase and download the content at their convenience directly to their console, PC,
or mobile device through our platform partners, including Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft"), Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. ("Sony"), Nintendo Co., Ltd. ("Nintendo"), Apple Inc. ("Apple"),
Google Inc.
("Google"), and Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook"). Blizzard utilizes its proprietary online gaming service, Battle.net®, to distribute most of Blizzard's content directly to PC consumers.

In
addition to serving as a distribution platform, Blizzard's Battle.net offers players communications features, social networking, player matching and digital content delivery and is
designed to allow people to connect regardless of what Blizzard game they are playing. It attracts millions of active players, making it one of the largest online game-related services in the world.

Manufacturing

We prepare master program copies for our products on each release platform. With respect to products for Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo consoles,
our disk duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly and shipping are performed by third-party subcontractors or distribution facilities owned by us.

Microsoft,
Sony, and Nintendo generally specify or control the manufacturing and assembly of finished products and license their hardware technologies to us for which we pay an
applicable royalty per unit once the manufacturer fills the product order, even if the units do not ultimately sell. We



deliver
the master materials to the licensor or its approved replicator, who then manufactures the finished goods and delivers them to us for distribution under our label.

Significant Customers and Top Franchises

Customers

While the Company does sell directly to end consumers in certain instances, such as sales through our Battle.net platform, in other instances
our customers may be platform providers, such as Sony, Microsoft, and Apple, or retailers, such as Wal-Mart and GameStop, who act as distributors of our content to end consumers. For the year end
December 31, 2016, Sony and Apple each accounted for 13% of our net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Sony and Microsoft accounted for 12% and 10%, respectively, of our net
revenues. We did not have any single customer that accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014.

We
had three customers—Sony, Microsoft, and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.—who accounted for 17%, 10%, and 10%, respectively, of consolidated gross receivables at
December 31, 2016, and 18%, 13%, and 11%, respectively, of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2015.

Top Franchises

For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top four franchises—Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and
Overwatch—collectively accounted for 69% of our net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our top four franchises—Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Destiny, and
Hearthstone—collectively accounted for 75% of our net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our top four franchises—Call of Duty, World of Warcraft,
Skylanders, and Diablo—collectively accounted for 75% of our net revenues.

Competition

We compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other interactive entertainment companies, as well as with
providers of different forms of entertainment, such as film, television, social networking, music and other consumer products.

The
interactive entertainment industry is intensely competitive and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly introduced. We believe that the main
competitive factors in the interactive entertainment industry include: product features, game quality, and playability; brand
name recognition; compatibility of products with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; online capability and functionality; ease of use; price; marketing support; and quality of customer
service.

We
compete with other publishers of video game console, PC, and mobile interactive entertainment software. In addition to third-party software competitors, integrated video game console
hardware and software companies, such as Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms. A number of software publishers
have developed and commercialized, or are currently developing, online games for use by consumers. Further, we compete with publishers of mobile games. Lastly, with our Skylanders franchise and its
toys and accessories, we compete indirectly with companies who sell toys to our target consumers for this franchise.

Intellectual Property

Like other interactive entertainment companies, our business is significantly dependent on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of
intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted software code, patented technology, and other technology and trade secrets



that
we use to develop and run our games. Other intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted audio-visual elements that consumers can see, hear and interact with when they are playing our
games.

We
develop a majority of our products based on wholly-owned intellectual properties, such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, among others. In other cases, we obtain
intellectual property through licenses and service agreements, such as for our Destiny franchise. Further, our products that play on consoles and mobile platforms include technology that is owned by
the platform provider and is licensed non-exclusively to us for use in the relevant product. We also license technology from providers other than console manufacturers in developing our content and
services. While we may have renewal rights for some licenses, our business is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on
reasonable terms and at reasonable rates.

We
actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property. For our PC products, we use copy protection technology or other technological protection
measures to prevent piracy and the use of unauthorized copies of our products. For other platforms, the platform providers typically incorporate technological protections and other security measures
in their platforms to prevent the use of unlicensed products on those platforms. In addition, we are actively engaged in enforcement of our copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret rights
against potential infringers of those rights along with other protective activities, including monitoring online channels for distribution of pirated copies and participating in various enforcement
initiatives, education programs and legislative activity around the world.

Item 1A.    RISK FACTORS

We wish to caution the reader that the following important risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in
this report or in our other filings with the SEC, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document and elsewhere. These
risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Further, the risks described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently
known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition,
results of operations, profitability, cash flows, liquidity or stock price.

If we do not consistently deliver popular, high-quality content in a timely manner, or if consumers prefer
competing products, our business may be negatively impacted.

Consumer preferences for games are usually cyclical and difficult to predict, and even the most successful content remains popular for only
limited periods of time, unless refreshed with new content or otherwise enhanced. In order to remain competitive, we must continuously develop new products or enhancements to existing products. These
products may not be well-received by consumers, even if well-reviewed and of high quality. Further, competitors may develop content that imitates or competes with our best-selling games, potentially
taking sales away from them or reducing our ability to charge the same prices we have historically charged for our products. These competing products may take a larger share of consumer spending than
anticipated, which could cause product sales to fall below expectations. If we do not continue to develop consistently high-quality and well-received games, if our marketing fails to resonate with our
consumers, if consumers lose interest in a genre of games we produce, if the use of cross-promotion within our mobile games to retain consumers becomes less effective, or if our competitors develop
more successful products or offer competitive products at lower prices, our revenues and profit margins could decline. Further, a failure by us to develop a high-quality product, or our development of
a product that is otherwise not well-received, could potentially result in additional expenditures to respond to consumer demands, harm our reputation, and increase the likelihood that our future
products will not be well-received. The increased importance of downloadable content to our business amplifies these risks, as downloadable content for poorly-received games typically generates
lower-than-expected sales. In addition, our own best-selling products could compete with our other games, reducing sales for those other games.

Additionally,
consumer expectations regarding the quality, performance and integrity of our products and services are high. Consumers may be critical of our brands, games, services
and/or business practices for a wide variety of reasons, and such negative reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to manage effectively. For example, if our games or services, such as
our proprietary online gaming service, do not function as consumers expect, whether because they fail to function as



advertised
or otherwise, our sales may suffer. The risk that this may occur is particularly pronounced with respect to our games with online features because they involve ongoing consumer
expectations, which we may not be able to consistently satisfy. Our games with online features are also frequently updated, increasing the risk that a game may contain significant "bugs." If any of
these issues occur, consumers may stop playing the game and may be less likely to return to the game as often in the future, which may negatively impact our business.

Further,
delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and reputation and
could cause our results of operations to be materially different from expectations. If we fail to release our products in a timely manner, or if we are unable to continue to extend the life of
existing games by adding features and functionality that will encourage continued engagement with the game, our business may be negatively impacted.

Additionally,
the amount of lead time and cost involved in the development of high-quality products is increasing, and the longer the lead time involved in developing a product and the
greater the allocation of financial resources to such product, the more critical it is that we accurately predict consumer demand for such product. If our future products do not achieve expected
consumer acceptance or generate sufficient revenues upon introduction, we may not be able to recover the substantial up-front development and marketing costs associated with those products.

We depend on a relatively small number of franchises for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.

We follow a franchise model and a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from products based on a relatively small
number of popular franchises. These products are responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, revenues associated with the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of
Warcraft, and Overwatch franchises, collectively, accounted for approximately 69% of our net revenues, and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income, for 2016. We expect that a
relatively limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our revenues and profits. Due to this dependence on a limited number of franchises, the
failure to achieve anticipated results by one or more products based on these franchises could negatively impact our business. Additionally, if the popularity of a franchise declines, we may have to
write off the unrecovered portion of the underlying intellectual property assets, which could negatively impact our business. Further, if a new franchise does not gain consumer acceptance, whether
because we are unable to successfully create consumer appeal and brand recognition or for other reasons, our business could be negatively impacted.

We may be unable to effectively manage the growth in the scope and complexity of our business.

We have experienced significant growth in the scope and complexity of our business, including through the acquisition of King and the
development of our MLG, Studios and consumer products businesses. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to manage this expanded business. The growth of our business could create
significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, and could increase existing strain on, and divert focus from, our core businesses. If not managed effectively, this
growth could result in the over-extension of our operating infrastructure, and our management systems, information technology systems, and internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to
support this growth. Failure to adequately manage our growth in any of these ways may cause damage to our brand or otherwise negatively impact our business. Further, any failure by these new
businesses may damage our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our core business of interactive software products and entertainment content.



The increasing importance of free-to-play games to our business exposes us to the risks of that business
model, including the dependence on a relatively small number of consumers for a significant portion of revenues and profits from any given game.

As a result of, among other things, the King Acquisition, we are more dependent on our ability to develop, enhance and monetize free-to-play
games, such as the games in our Candy Crush franchise and

Hearthstone

. As such, we are increasingly exposed to the risks of the free-to-play business
model. For example, we may invest in the development of new free-to-play interactive entertainment products that do not achieve significant commercial success, in which case our revenues from those
products likely will be lower than anticipated and we may not recover our development costs. Further, if: (1) we are unable to continue to offer free-to-play games that encourage consumers to
purchase our virtual currency and subsequently use it to buy our virtual items; (2) we fail to offer monetization features that appeal to these consumers; (3) these consumers do not
continue to play our free-to-play games or purchase virtual items at the same rate; (4) our platform providers make it more difficult or expensive for players to purchase our virtual currency;
or (5) we cannot encourage significant additional consumers to purchase virtual items in our free-to-play games, our business may be negatively impacted.

Furthermore,
as there are relatively low barriers to entry to developing mobile or online free-to-play or other casual games, we expect new competitors to enter the market and existing
competitors to allocate
more resources to developing and marketing competing games and applications. We compete, or may compete, with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch casual
games and other content using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. Competition for the attention of consumers on mobile devices is intense, as the
number of applications on mobile devices has been increasing dramatically, which, in turn, has required increased marketing to garner consumer awareness and attention. This increased competition could
negatively impact our business. In addition, a continuing industry shift to free-to-play games could result in a deprioritization of our other products by traditional retailers and distributors.

Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate
our resources among, emerging technologies and business models, our business may be negatively impacted.

Technology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry. We must continually anticipate and adapt our products, distribution
channels and business models to emerging technologies and delivery platforms in order to stay competitive. Forecasting our revenues and profitability for these new products, distribution channels and
business models is inherently uncertain and volatile, and if we invest in the development of interactive entertainment products or distribution channels incorporating a new technology or for a new
platform that does not achieve significant commercial success, whether because of competition or otherwise, we may not recover the often substantial "up front" cost of developing and marketing those
products and distribution channels, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other products or distribution channels. Further, our competitors may
adapt to an emerging technology or business model more quickly or effectively than we do, creating products that are technologically superior to ours, more appealing to consumers, or both.

If,
on the other hand, we elect not to pursue the development of products incorporating a new technology or for new platforms, or otherwise elect not to pursue new business models, that
achieve significant commercial success, it may have adverse consequences. It may take significant time and resources to shift product development resources to that technology, platform or business
model, as the case may be, and may be more difficult to compete against existing products incorporating that technology or for that platform or against companies using that business model.



The increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model,
including greater competition.

The proportion of our revenues derived from digital content delivery, as compared to traditional retail sales, continues to increase. The
increased importance of digital content delivery in our industry increases our potential competition, as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game, particularly a
new game for mobile platforms, may be significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution and is played on a game console. Also, while
digitally-distributed products generally have higher profit margins than retail sales, the risk profile for us, as the publisher, may be increased as business shifts to digital distribution, since the
volume of initial orders from retailers for physical discs could be reduced.

Competition within, and to, the interactive entertainment industry is intense, and competitors may succeed in
reducing our sales.

Within the interactive entertainment industry, we compete with other publishers of interactive entertainment software, both within and outside
the United States. Our competitors include very large corporations with significantly greater financial, marketing and product development resources than we have. Our larger competitors may be able to
leverage their greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources to provide larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially
desirable properties, as well as adopt more aggressive pricing policies to develop more commercially successful video game products than we do. In addition, competitors with large product lines and
popular games typically have greater leverage with retailers, distributors and other customers, who may be willing to promote products with less consumer appeal in return for access to those
competitors' more popular games.

Additionally,
we compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities. Further, it is difficult to predict and prepare for rapid changes in consumer demand that could
materially alter public preferences for different forms of entertainment and leisure activities. Failure to adequately identify and adapt to these competitive pressures could negatively impact our
business.

If we are unable to sustain traditional pricing levels for our products, our business may be negatively
impacted.

If we are unable to sustain traditional pricing levels for our console or PC titles or the associated downloadable content, whether due to
competitive pressure, because retailers or other
third parties elect to price these products at a lower price, or otherwise, it could have a negative impact on our business. Further, our decisions around the development of new game content are
grounded in assumptions about eventual pricing levels. If there is price compression in the market after these decisions are made, it could have a negative impact on our business.

If we do not continue to attract and retain skilled personnel, we will be unable to effectively conduct our
business.

Our employees are our greatest asset. As such, our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify, attract, hire, retain and
utilize the abilities of qualified personnel, particularly personnel with the specialized skills needed to create and sell the high-quality, well-received content upon which our business is
substantially dependent. The software industry generally experiences a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors for employees with technical, marketing, sales,
engineering, product development, creative and/or management skills. We may have difficulties in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do so. If we are
unable to attract additional qualified employees or retain and utilize the services of key personnel, it could have a negative impact on our business.



We rely on external developers to develop some of our software products.

We rely on external software developers to develop some of our software products, particularly in the mobile space. Because we depend on these
developers, we are subject to the following risks.

•

Continuing strong demand for top-tier developers' resources, combined with the recognition they receive in connection with their work, may
cause developers who worked for us in the past either to work for a competitor in the future or to renegotiate agreements with us on terms less favorable to us.

•

Limited financial resources and business expertise and inability to retain skilled personnel may force developers out of business prior to
completing products for us or require us to fund additional costs.

•

A competitor may acquire the businesses of key developers or sign them to exclusive development arrangements and, in either case, we would not
be able to continue to engage such developers' services for our products, except for any period of time for which those developers are contractually obligated to complete development for us.

•

Reliance on external developers reduces our visibility into, and control over, development schedules and operational outcomes compared to those
when utilizing internal development resources.

Increased
competition for skilled third-party software developers also has compelled us to agree to make significant advance payments on royalties to game developers. If the products
subject to these arrangements do not generate sufficient revenues to recover these royalty advances, we would have to write off unrecovered portions of these payments, which could negatively impact
our business. Typically, we pay developers a royalty based on a percentage of net revenues from product sales, less agreed upon deductions, but from time to time, we have agreed to pay developers
fixed per unit product royalties after royalty advances are fully recouped. To the extent that sales prices of products on which we have agreed to pay a fixed per unit royalty are marked down, it
could negatively impact our business.

We engage in strategic transactions and may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses or
otherwise realizing the anticipated benefits of the transactions.

As part of our business strategy, from time to time, we acquire, make investments in, or enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures with,
complementary businesses. These transactions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: (A) in the case of an acquisition, (i) the potential for the acquired business to
underperform relative to our expectations and the acquisition price, (ii) the potential for the acquired business to cause our financial results to differ from expectations in any given period,
or over the longer-term, (iii) unexpected tax consequences from the acquisition, or the tax treatment of the acquired business's operations going forward, giving rise to incremental tax
liabilities that are difficult to predict, (iv) difficulty in integrating the acquired business, its operations and its employees in an efficient and effective manner, (v) any unknown
liabilities or
internal control deficiencies assumed as part of the acquisition, and (vi) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, and, (B) in the case of an investment, alliance
or joint venture, (i) our ability to cooperate with our partner, (ii) our partner having economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and
(iii) the potential that our partner may be unable to meet its economic or other obligations, which would require us to fulfill those obligations alone. Further, any such transaction may
involve the risk that our senior management's attention will be excessively diverted from our other operations, the risk that our industry does not evolve as anticipated and that any intellectual
property or personnel skills acquired do not prove to be those needed for our future



success,
and the risk that our strategic objectives, cost savings or other anticipated benefits are otherwise not achieved.

On
February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition. In addition to the above listed risks, by acquiring King we assumed certain liabilities that may prove to be greater than
anticipated. The liabilities we assumed include those with respect to King's ongoing legal proceedings, including the purported securities class action lawsuit relating to King's initial public
offering in March 2014, and those with respect to King's potential tax liabilities in various jurisdictions. Any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses and adversely affect our
financial position.

Our debt could adversely affect our business.

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $4.9 billion of long-term debt outstanding. Our debt burden could have
important consequences, including: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business
and our industry; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of
cash flow to fund our operations, growth strategy, working capital, capital expenditures, future business opportunities, and other general corporate purposes; exposing us to the risk of increased
interest rates with respect to any borrowings that are at floating rates of interest; restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; limiting our
ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; limiting our ability to adjust to
changing market conditions; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who are less highly leveraged. In addition, a significant portion of our cash and investments are
held outside the United States, and we may not be able to service our debt without undergoing the costs of repatriating those funds.

Agreements
governing our indebtedness, including our credit agreement and the indentures governing our notes, impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These
restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios. In addition, under certain circumstances, our credit agreement and indentures may limit or prohibit our ability
to, among other things: incur additional debt and guarantees; pay distributions or dividends and repurchase stock; make other restricted payments, including without limitation, certain investments;
create liens; enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries; engage in transactions with affiliates; and enter into mergers, consolidations or sales of substantially all of our
assets. In addition, we are required to maintain a maximum total net debt ratio calculated pursuant to a financial maintenance covenant under our credit agreement. Further, various risks,
uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our financing agreements could result in a default
under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Such a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements. Under these
circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under our credit agreement or the indentures governing our notes. In
addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. There can
be no assurances that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on
terms acceptable to us, or at all.

We may be involved in legal proceedings that have a negative impact on our business.

From time to time, we are involved in claims, suits, government investigations, audits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our
business, including actions with respect to intellectual



property,
competition and antitrust matters, privacy matters, tax matters, labor and employment matters, unclaimed property matters, compliance and commercial claims. In addition, negative consumer
sentiment about our business practices may result in inquiries or investigations from regulatory agencies and consumer groups, as well as litigation, which, regardless of their outcome, may be
damaging to our reputation.

Claims,
suits, government investigations, audits and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results are subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are outside of our
control. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have a materially adverse impact on us due to legal costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. In addition, it is
possible that a resolution of one
or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm, substantial settlements, judgments, fines or penalties, criminal sanctions, consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain
features, functionalities, products or services, requiring us to change our development process or other business practices.

There
is also inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for these matters. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of these matters, including assessing the probability
of potential outcomes and determining whether a potential exposure can be reasonably estimated. In making these determinations, we, in consultation with outside counsel, examine the relevant facts and
circumstances on a quarterly basis assuming, as applicable, a combination of settlement and litigated outcomes and strategies. Further, it may take time to develop factors on which reasonable
judgments and estimates can be based. If we fail to establish appropriate reserves, our business could be negatively impacted.

Issues with the toys, accessories or hardware peripherals utilized in certain of our games may lead to
product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities.

We may experience issues with toys, accessories or peripherals (such as the toys and accessories sold with our Skylanders games or the hardware
peripherals sold with our Guitar Hero® games) that may lead to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by
governmental authorities. Any of these activities could result in increased governmental scrutiny, harm to our reputation, reduced demand by consumers for our products, decreased willingness by our
customers to purchase, or by our partners to provide marketing support for, those products, denial or increased cost for insurance coverage, or additional safety and testing requirements, any of which
could negatively impact our business.

Lawsuits have been filed, and may continue to be filed, against publishers of interactive entertainment
software products.

In prior years, lawsuits have been filed against numerous interactive entertainment companies, including against us, by the families of victims
of violence, alleging that interactive entertainment products influence the behavior of the perpetrators of such violence. These lawsuits have been dismissed, but similar additional lawsuits could be
filed in the future. Although our general liability insurance carrier has agreed to defend lawsuits of this nature with respect to the prior lawsuits, it is uncertain whether insurance carriers would
do so in the future, or if such insurance carriers would cover all or any amounts for which we might be liable if such future lawsuits are not decided in our favor. Further, any such lawsuit could
result in increased governmental scrutiny, harm to our reputation, reduced demand by consumers for our products, or decreased willingness by our customers to purchase, or by our partners to provide
marketing support for, those products. Such results could
divert development and management resources, increase legal fees and other costs and have other negative impacts on our business.



We are exposed to seasonality in the sale of our products.

The interactive entertainment industry is somewhat seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the year-end holiday
buying season in the fourth quarter of the year. As a result, our sales have historically been highest during the second half of the year, particularly for our Activision segment. Receivables and
credit risk are likewise higher during the second half of the year, as retailers increase their purchases of our products in anticipation of the holiday season. Delays in development, approvals or
manufacturing could affect the timing of the release of products, causing us to miss key selling periods such as the year-end holiday buying season, which could negatively impact our business.

Our business may be harmed if our distributors, retailers, development and licensing partners, or other third
parties with whom we do business act in ways that put our brand at risk.

In many cases, our business partners are given access to sensitive and proprietary information or control over our intellectual property in
order to provide services and support to our team. These third parties may misappropriate our information or intellectual property and engage in unauthorized use of it or otherwise act in a way that
places our brand at risk. The failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies, the failure of third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and
technologies or the misappropriation or misuse of this information or intellectual property could result in a disruption to our business operations or an adverse effect on our reputation, and may
negatively impact our business.

We use open source software in connection with certain of our games and services, which may pose particular
risks to our proprietary software, products, and services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business.

We use open source software in connection with certain of our games and the services we offer. Some open source software licenses require users
who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on
unfavorable terms or at no cost. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes
unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software. Were it determined that our use was not in compliance with a particular license, we may be required to release our
proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our games or products, discontinue distribution in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or take
other remedial action that may divert resources away from our game development efforts, any of which could negatively impact our business.

We may be subject to intellectual property claims.

As the number of interactive entertainment software products increases and the features and content of these products continue to overlap,
software developers have increasingly become subject to infringement claims. Further, many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on real-world things or people,
which may also be the subject of intellectual property infringement claims of others, including right of publicity, trademark, and unfair competition claims. In addition, our products often utilize
complex, cutting-edge technology that may become subject to emerging intellectual property claims of others. Although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of
others, third parties may still claim infringement, particularly since there are many companies that focus exclusively on enforcing patent rights.

From
time to time, we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid or not, may be time consuming,
distracting to



management
and expensive to defend. Further, intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:

•

cease selling, incorporating, supporting or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;

•

obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which, if available at all, may not be available on commercially
favorable terms;

•

redesign the affected interactive entertainment software products, which could result in additional costs, delay introduction and possibly
reduce commercial appeal of the affected products; or

•

pay damages to the holder of the infringed intellectual property for past infringements.

Our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying, and inadequate intellectual
property laws and other protections could prevent us from enforcing or defending our proprietary technologies. We may also face legal risks arising out of user-generated content. Further, the use of
unauthorized "cheat" programs or the use of other unauthorized software modifications by users could lead to reductions in microtransactions in our games.

We regard our software as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret
laws and employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary rights. We own or license various copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. The process of registering
and protecting these rights in various jurisdictions is expensive and time-consuming. Further, we are aware that some unauthorized copying occurs, and if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized
copying of our software products were to occur, it could negatively impact our business.

Piracy
is a persistent problem for us, and policing the unauthorized sale, distribution and use of our products is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. Further, the laws of some
countries in which our
products are, or may be, distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or are poorly enforced. In addition,
though we take steps to make the unauthorized sale, distribution and use of our products more difficult and to otherwise enforce and police our rights, as do the manufacturers of consoles and the
operators of other platforms on which many of our games are played, our efforts and the efforts of the console manufacturers and platform operators may not be successful in controlling the piracy of
our products in all instances. Technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used by console manufacturers and platform operators or by us in our products, the increasing availability of
broadband access to the Internet, the refusal of Internet service providers to remove infringing content in certain instances, the ability to download pirated copies of games from various Internet
sites and peer-to-peer networks could result in an expansion in piracy.

In
addition, "cheating" programs or other unauthorized software tools and modifications that enable consumers to cheat in games, such as those in our Candy Crush franchise, could
negatively impact the volume of microtransactions or purchases of downloadable content. In addition, vulnerabilities in the design of our applications and of the platforms upon which they run could be
discovered after their release, which may result in lost revenue opportunities. This may lead to lost revenues from paying consumers or increased cost of developing technological measures to respond
to these, either of which could negatively impact our business.



We also cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in connection with emerging technologies.

Due to our reliance on third party platforms, platform licensors are frequently able to influence our
products and costs

Generally, when we develop interactive entertainment software products for hardware platforms offered by Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo, the
physical products are manufactured exclusively by that hardware manufacturer or their approved replicator. The agreements with these manufacturers include certain provisions, such as approval rights
over all software products and related promotional materials and the ability to change the fee they charge for the manufacturing of products, which allow the hardware manufacturers substantial
influence over the cost and the release schedule of such interactive entertainment software products. In addition, because each of the manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware
platforms and manufactures products for all of its other licensees, a manufacturer may give priority to its own products or those of our competitors.
Accordingly, Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo could cause unanticipated delays in the release of our products, as well as increases to projected development, manufacturing, marketing or distribution
costs, any of which could negatively impact our business.

The
platform licensors also control the networks over which consumers purchase digital products and services for their platforms and through which we provide online game capabilities for
our console platform products. The control that the platform licensors have over the fee structures and/or retail pricing for products and services for their platforms and online networks could impact
the volume of purchases of our products made over their networks and our profitability. With respect to certain downloadable content and microtransactions, the networks provided by these platform
licensors are the exclusive means of selling and distributing this content. Further, increased competition for limited premium "digital shelf space" has placed the platform licensors in an
increasingly better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale. If the platform licensor establishes terms that restrict our offerings on its platform, or significantly impact the financial terms
on which these products or services are offered to our customers, or does not renew our license or approve the inclusion of online capabilities in our console products, our business could be
negatively impacted.

We
also derive significant revenues from the distribution of free-to-play games on third-party web and mobile platforms such as the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook,
and most of the virtual currency we sell is purchased using the payment processing systems of these platform providers. These platforms also serve as significant online distribution platforms for our
games. If these platforms modify their current discovery mechanisms, communication channels available to developers, terms of service or other policies (including fees), or they develop their own
competitive offerings, our business could be negatively impacted. Further, if these platform providers are required to change how they label free-to-play games or take payment for in-app purchases or
change how the personal information of consumers is made available to developers, our business could be negatively impacted.

Our business is highly dependent on the success and availability of video game platforms manufactured by
third parties, as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured by third parties, such
as Sony's PS4 and PS3, Microsoft's Xbox One and Xbox 360, and Nintendo's Wii U, Wii and soon-to-be-released Switch. For example, sales of products for consoles accounted for 37% of our
consolidated net revenues in 2016. The success of our console business is driven in large part by our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace and our
ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms. We also rely on the availability of an adequate supply of these video game platforms and the continued support for these
platforms by their manufacturers. We must make product development decisions and



commit
significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform, and development costs for new console platforms may be greater than those costs for the then-current
console platforms. If increased costs are not offset by higher revenues and other cost efficiencies, our business could be negatively impacted. If the platforms for which we develop new software
products or modify existing products do not attain significant market acceptance, we may not be able to recover our development costs, which could be significant.

The importance of retail sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model.

In the United States and Canada, our "boxed" products are often sold on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores,
discount warehouses and game specialty stores. Our "boxed" products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements, and through our
wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries. Our sales are made primarily on a purchase order basis without long-term agreements or other forms of commitments, and our retail customers and
distributors have generally been reducing the levels of inventory they are willing to carry. The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any of Activision's principal retail customers or
distributors could have adverse consequences. In addition, having such a large portion of our total net revenues concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers.

Further,
the concentration of sales in a small number of large customers also makes us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers becomes unable to pay
for our products or seeks protection under the bankruptcy laws. Retailers and distributors in the interactive entertainment industry have from time to time experienced significant fluctuations in
their businesses and a number of them have failed. Challenging economic conditions may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased and, as a result, our reserves for
doubtful accounts and write-off of accounts receivable could increase and, even if increased, may turn out to be insufficient. Moreover, even in cases where we have insurance to protect against a
customer's bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation, this insurance typically contains a significant deductible and co-payment obligation, and does not cover all instances of non-payment. Further, the
insolvency or business failure of other types of business partners could result in disruptions to the manufacturing or distribution of our products or the cancellation of contractual arrangements that
we consider to be favorable. A payment default by, or the insolvency or business failure of, a significant business partner could negatively impact our business.

Moreover,
the importance of retail sales to our business exposes us to the risk of product returns and price protection with respect to our distributors and retailers. In some cases,
return policies allow distributors and retailers to return defective, shelf-worn, damaged and certain other products in accordance with terms granted. Price protection, when granted and applicable,
allows these distributors and retailers a credit against amounts owed with respect to merchandise unsold by them. We may
permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, distributors and retail customers who meet certain conditions. These conditions may include compliance with applicable payment terms,
delivery of weekly inventory and sales information and consistent participation in the launches of premium title releases. We may also consider other factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving
inventory and other industry factors. Activision also offers a 90-day limited warranty to end users that Activision products will be free from manufacturing defects. Although we maintain a reserve for
returns and price protection, and although we may place limits on product returns and price protection, we could be forced to accept substantial product returns and provide substantial price
protection to maintain our relationships with retailers and our access to distribution channels. We face similar issues and risks, including exposure to risk of chargebacks, with respect to end users
to whom we sell products directly, whether through our proprietary online gaming service or otherwise.



Further,
retailers typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources, and there is intense competition for high-quality retail shelf space and promotional support
from retailers. Competition for shelf space may intensify and may require us to increase our marketing expenditures. Retailers with limited shelf space typically devote the most and highest quality
shelf space to those products expected to be best sellers. We cannot be certain that our new products will consistently achieve such "best seller" status. Due to increased competition for limited
shelf space, retailers and distributors are in an increasingly better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale, including price discounts, price protection, marketing and display fees and product
return policies. Our products constitute a relatively small percentage of most retailers' sales volume. We cannot be certain that retailers will continue to purchase our products or provide those
products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support on acceptable terms.

Additionally,
we make provisions for retail inventory price protection based upon certain assumed lowest prices and if competitive pressures force us to lower our prices below those
levels, it could similarly have a negative impact on our business. Further, because we pay a licensing fee to the console hardware manufacturer for each physical copy of a product manufactured for
that manufacturer's game platform regardless of whether that product is actually sold, if we overestimate demand and make too many physical "boxed" copies of any title, we will incur unrecoverable
manufacturing costs for unsold units.

We are a global company and are subject to the risks and uncertainties of conducting business outside the
U.S.

We conduct business throughout the world, and we derive a substantial amount of our revenues and profits from international trade, particularly
from Europe, Asia and Australia. Moving forward, we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of
our total revenues and profits and, moreover, that sales in emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere will be an increasingly important part of our international sales. As such, we are, and may be
increasingly, subject to risks inherent in foreign trade generally, as well as risks inherent in doing business in emerging markets, including increased tariffs and duties, compliance with economic
sanctions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, shipping delays, increases in transportation costs, international political, regulatory and economic developments, unexpected changes to laws,
regulatory requirements and enforcement on us and our platform partners and differing local business practices, all of which may impact profit margins or make it more difficult, if not impossible, for
us to conduct business in foreign markets.

A
deterioration in relations between either us or the United States and any country in which we have significant operations or sales, or the implementation of government regulations in
such a country, could result in the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including economic sanctions, that could have a material adverse effect on our business. For instance, to operate in
China, all games must have regulatory approval. A decision by the Chinese government to revoke its approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in China in the
future could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, in the past, legislation has been implemented in China that has required modifications to our software. The future
implementation of similar laws or regulations in China or any other country in which we have operations or sales may restrict or prohibit the sale of our products or may require engineering
modifications to our products that are not cost-effective, if even feasible at all, or could degrade the consumer experience to the point where consumers cease to purchase such products. Further, the
enforcement of regulation of mobile and other games with an online element in China remains uncertain, and further changes, either in the regulations or their enforcement, could have a material impact
on our business in China.

The
majority of the manufacturers of our toys, accessories and hardware peripherals are third parties located in China. Anything that impacts our ability to import these products or the
ability of those manufacturers to produce or otherwise supply us with hardware meeting our quality and safety



standards
or increases the manufacturers' costs of production may adversely impact our ability to supply that hardware to the market and the prices we must pay for that hardware. Such impacts may
include changes in safety, environmental or other regulations applicable to the hardware and the manufacturing thereof, labor shortages, civil unrest or issues generally negatively impacting
international companies operating in China, increases in the price of petroleum or other raw materials, increases in fuel prices and other shipping costs, and increases in local labor costs in China.

We
are also subject to risks that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our employees, contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents in ways that
violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. While we have policies and procedures, as well as training for our employees, intended to
secure compliance with
these laws, our employees, contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents may take actions that violate our policies. Moreover, it may be more difficult to oversee the conduct of any
such persons who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions.

Additionally,
in June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the European Union, commonly referred to as "Brexit." This referendum has
created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the European Union, and this uncertainty may persist for years. The uncertainty surrounding the terms of the United
Kingdom's withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the level of sales of discretionary items, including our products. Any of these effects could
negatively impact our business.

In
addition, cultural differences may affect consumer preferences and limit the international popularity of games that are popular in the U.S, or require us to modify the content of the
games or the method by which we charge our customers for the games to be successful. If we do not correctly assess consumer preferences in the countries in which we sell our products, or if the other
risks discussed herein come to fruition, it could negatively impact our business.

Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact our business.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and
calculations where the ultimate income tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. Although we believe our income tax estimates
are reasonable, the ultimate outcomes may have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

Our
income tax liability and effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business, the mix of earnings in countries with differing
statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws or tax rulings, changes in interpretations of existing laws, or developments in tax examinations or investigations. Any of these factors could have a material
adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. The tax regimes we are subject
to or operate under are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. The U.S., the European Union and its member states, and a number of other countries are actively pursuing fundamental
changes to the tax laws applicable to multinational companies like us. Furthermore, tax authorities may choose to examine or investigate our tax reporting or tax liability, including under transfer
pricing or permanent establishment theories. These proceedings may lead to adjustments or proposed adjustments to our income taxes or provisions for uncertain tax positions.

We
earn a significant amount of our operating income, and hold a significant portion of our cash and investments, outside the United States. While our intent is to permanently reinvest
these funds outside of the United States, any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions would



likely
result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are
taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether, or in what form, this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could negatively impact our business.

We
are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and
various other jurisdictions. Tax authorities regularly examine these non-income taxes. The outcomes from these examinations, changes in the business, changes in applicable tax rules or other tax
matters may have a material adverse effect on our business.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively impact our business.

We transact business in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar and have significant international sales and expenses denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar, subjecting us to currency exchange rate risks. A substantial portion of our international sales and expenses are denominated in local currencies, including
euros, British pounds, Australian dollars, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, and Swedish krona, which could fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. Since we have significant international sales, but incur
the majority of our costs in the United States, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our
business. We have, in the past, utilized currency derivative contracts to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures and managed these exposures with natural offsets. However, there can be no assurance
that we will continue our hedging programs, or that we will be successful in managing exposure to currency exchange rate risks whether or not we do so.

Our games are subject to scrutiny regarding the appropriateness of their content. If we fail to receive our
target ratings for certain titles, or if our retailers refuse to sell such titles due to what they perceive to be objectionable content, it could have a negative impact on our business.

Our console and PC games are subject to ratings by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (the "ESRB"), a self-regulatory body based in the
U.S. that provides U.S. and Canadian consumers of interactive entertainment software with ratings information, including information on the content in such software, such as violence, nudity or sexual
content, along with an assessment of the suitability of the content for certain age groups. Certain other countries have also established content rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in
those countries. In addition, certain stores use other ratings systems, such as Apple's use of its proprietary "App Rating System" and Google Play's use of the International Age Rating Coalition
(IARC) rating system. If we are unable to obtain the ratings we have targeted for our products, it could have a negative impact on our business. In some instances, we may be required to modify our
products to comply with the requirements of the rating systems, which could delay or disrupt the release of any given product, or may prevent its sale altogether in certain territories. Further, if
one of our games is "re-rated" for any reason, a ratings organization could require corrective actions, which could include a recall, retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the
return of any unsold or returned copies or consumers could demand a refund for copies previously purchased.

Additionally,
retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they
deem inappropriate for their businesses, whether because a product received a certain rating by the ESRB or other content rating system, or otherwise. If retailers decline to sell our products based
upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes, graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content, we might be required to modify particular titles or
forfeit the revenue opportunity of selling such titles with that retailer.



Further,
throughout the history of the interactive entertainment industry, many interactive software products have included hidden content and/or hidden gameplay features, some of which
have been accessible through the use of in-game codes or other technological means, that are intended to enhance the gameplay experience. In some cases, such undisclosed content or features have been
considered to be objectionable. While publishers are required to disclose pertinent hidden content during the ESRB ratings process, in a few cases, publishers have failed to disclose hidden content,
and the ESRB has required the recall of the game, changed the rating or associated content descriptors originally assigned to the product, required the publisher to change the game or game packaging
and/or imposed fines on the publisher. Retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of such undisclosed content by removing these games from their shelves, refusing to sell them and demanding
that their publishers accept them as product returns. Likewise, some interactive entertainment software consumers have
reacted to the revelation of undisclosed content by refusing to purchase such games, demanding refunds for games they have already purchased, refraining from buying other games published by the
company whose game contained the objectionable material, and, on at least one occasion, filing a lawsuit against the publisher of the product containing such content.

We
have implemented preventive measures designed to reduce the possibility of objectionable undisclosed content from appearing in the interactive software products we publish.
Nonetheless, these preventive measures are subject to human error, circumvention, overriding and reasonable resource constraints. If an interactive software product we publish is found to contain
undisclosed content, we could be subject to any of these consequences.

Our business, products, and distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories. If we do
not successfully respond to these regulations, our business could be negatively impacted.

Legislation is continually being introduced, and litigation and regulatory enforcement actions are taking place, that may affect the way in
which we, and other industry participants, may offer content and features, and distribute and advertise our products. The video game industry continues to evolve, and new and innovative business
opportunities are often subject to new attempts at regulation. Many foreign countries, such as China and Germany, have laws that permit governmental entities to restrict or prohibit marketing or
distribution of interactive entertainment software products because of the content therein (and similar legislation has been introduced at one time or another at the federal and state levels in the
United States). Further, the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual items and currency may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional
burdens or limitations on operations of companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices. We are subject to laws and regulations related to protection of minors,
consumer privacy, accessibility, advertising, taxation, payments, intellectual property, distribution, and antitrust, among others. Also, existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of in-app
purchases, regulation of currency, banking institutions, virtual currencies, unclaimed property, and money laundering may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods. Furthermore, the growth and
development of electronic commerce and virtual items and currency may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens or limitations on operations of
companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices. The adoption and enforcement of legislation that restricts the marketing, content, business model, or sales of our
products in countries in which we do business may harm the sales of our products, as the products we are able to offer to our customers and the size of the potential market for our products may be
limited. We may be required to modify certain product development processes or products or alter our marketing strategies to comply with regulations, which could be costly or delay the release of our
products. The laws and regulations affecting our products vary by territory and may be inconsistent with one another, imposing conflicting or uncertain restrictions. Failure to comply with any
applicable legislation may also result in government-imposed fines or other penalties, as well as harm to our reputation. Moreover, the public dialogue concerning interactive entertainment may have an
adverse impact on our reputation



and
consumers' willingness to purchase our products. Because the King Acquisition has significantly increased our user population, it may subject us to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions
and exacerbate the potential adverse impact on our business.

Although
we have structured and operate our skill tournaments with applicable laws in mind, including any applicable laws relating to gambling, and believe that playing these games does
not constitute gambling, our skill tournaments could in the future become subject to gambling-related rules and regulations and expose us to civil and criminal penalties. We also sometimes offer
consumers of our online and casual games various types of contests and promotional opportunities. We are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such
activities and games, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. If these were to occur, we might be required to seek licenses, authorizations, or
approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements, and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, such as
reporting to regulators, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States,
Europe, or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of casual game services and impair our business.

The laws and regulations concerning data privacy are continually evolving. Failure to comply with these laws
and regulations could harm our business.

Consumers play certain of our games online using third-party platforms and networks, through online social platforms, and on mobile devices. We
collect and store information about our consumers of these games—both personally identifying and non-personally identifying information. We are subject to laws from a variety of
jurisdictions regarding privacy and the protection of this information. For example, the European Union (the "E.U.") has traditionally taken a broader view than the United States and certain other
jurisdictions as to what is considered personal information and has imposed greater obligations under data privacy regulations. The U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") also
regulates the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from children under 13 years of age. Failure to comply with COPPA may increase our costs, subject us to expensive and
distracting government investigations, and result in substantial fines.

Data
privacy protection laws are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, which could impact our approach to operating and marketing our games. For
example, the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), which will come into effect in May 2018, imposes a range of new compliance obligations for us and other companies with European
users, and increases financial penalties for noncompliance significantly. The U.S. government, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, is continuing to review the need
for greater regulation over the collection of personal information and information about consumer
behavior on the Internet and on mobile devices, and the E.U. has proposed reforms to its existing data protection legal framework, including the GDPR. Various government and consumer agencies
worldwide have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. In addition, in some cases, we are dependent upon our platform providers to solicit, collect and provide us with
information regarding our consumers that is necessary for compliance with these various types of regulations.

Player
interaction with our games is subject to our privacy policies, end user license agreements ("EULAs"), and terms of service. If we fail to comply with our posted privacy policies,
EULAs, or terms of service, or if we fail to comply with existing privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, it could result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental
authorities or others, which could result in fines or judgments against us, damage our reputation, impact our financial condition and harm our business. If regulators, the media, or consumers raise
any concerns about our privacy and data protection or consumer protection practices, even if unfounded, this could also result



in
fines or judgments against us, damage our reputation, negatively impact our financial condition, and damage our business.

We depend on servers to operate our games with online features and our proprietary online gaming service. If
we were to lose server functionality for any reason, our business may be negatively impacted.

Our business relies on the continuous operation of servers, some of which are owned and operated by third parties. Although we strive to
maintain more than sufficient server capacity, and provide for active redundancy in the event of limited hardware failure, any broad-based catastrophic server malfunction, a significant
service-disrupting attack or intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures, a failure of disaster recovery service or the failure of a company on which we are relying for server capacity to
provide that capacity for whatever reason would likely degrade or interrupt the functionality of our games with online features, and could prevent the operation of such games altogether, any of which
could result in the loss of sales for, or in, such games. This risk is particularly pronounced with respect to the mobile games published by King, which rely on a small number of third-party owned
data centers located in one city, or with respect to the functioning of our proprietary online gaming service, Battle.net®, the disruption of which could prevent Blizzard from delivering
content digitally or render all of Blizzard's games unavailable.

We
also rely on networks operated by third parties, such as the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live and Steam, for the sale and digital delivery of downloadable console and PC game content
and the functionality of our games with online features. Similarly, we rely on the continued operation of the
Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook for the sale of virtual currency for our free-to-play games. An extended interruption to any of these services could adversely affect our ability
to sell and distribute our digital products and operate our games with online features, negatively impacting our business.

Further,
insufficient server capacity could also negatively impact our business. Conversely, if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business, we may incur
additional operating costs.

We rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant data
breach or system or network disruption could negatively impact our business.

In the course of our day-to-day business, we and third parties operating on our behalf create, store and/or use commercially sensitive
information, such as the source code and game assets for our interactive entertainment software products and confidential information with respect to our customers, consumers, and employees. A
malicious intrusion by hackers or other breach of the systems on which such source code and assets, account information (including personally identifiable information) and other sensitive data
(including credit card information maintained in a proprietary database) is stored could lead to piracy of our software, fraudulent activity, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, our
customers', consumers' or employees' personally identifiable information or our own sensitive business data. These attacks may remain undetected for prolonged periods of time. A data intrusion into a
server for a game with online features or for our proprietary online gaming service could also disrupt the operation of such game or platform. If we are subject to data security breaches, or a
security-related incident that materially disrupts the availability of our products and services, we may have a loss in sales or subscriptions or be forced to pay damages or incur other costs,
including from the implementation of additional security measures, or suffer reputational damage. Moreover, if there were a public perception that our data protection measures are inadequate, whether
or not the case, it could result in reputational damage and potential harm to our business relationships or the public perception of our business model. In addition, such data security breaches may
subject us to legal claims or proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, especially if there is loss,



disclosure,
or misappropriation of, or access to, our customers' credit card or other sensitive or personally identifiable information.

Our reported financial results could be significantly impacted by changes in financial accounting standards
or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves.

Our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the SEC and national accounting standards bodies and the
methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. Policies affecting revenue recognition have affected, and could further significantly affect, the way we report
revenues related to our products and services. We recognize a majority of the revenues from bundled sales (

i.e.

, video games that include an online
service component) on a deferred basis over an estimated service period for such games. In addition, we defer the cost of revenues of those products. Further, as we increase our downloadable content
and add new features to our online services, our estimate of the service period may change and we could be required to recognize revenues, and defer related costs, over a shorter or longer period of
time. As we enhance, expand and diversify our business and product offerings, the application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account
for revenues and taxes, could have a significant impact on our reported net revenues, net income and earnings per share under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States in any given
period.

Provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control.

Our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special
meetings. The regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the Company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this
effort. In addition, our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of so-called "blank check" preferred stock. This ability of our Board of Directors to issue and
fix the rights and preferences of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control.

Historically, our stock price has been highly volatile.

The trading price of our common stock has been, and could continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, including
for example, but without limitation:

•

quarter-to-quarter variations in results of operations;

•

the announcement of new products;

•

the announcement of lower prices on competing products;

•

product development or release schedules;

•

general conditions in the computer, software, entertainment, media or electronics industries, or in the worldwide economy;

•

announcements of developments in the overall worldwide market for interactive entertainment, including announcements of industry sales data;

•

the timing of the introduction of new platforms and delays in the actual release of new platforms;

•

hardware manufacturers' announcements of price changes for hardware platforms;

•

consumer acceptance of hardware platforms;



•

consumer spending trends;

•

the outcome of lawsuits or regulatory investigations in which we are, or may become, involved;

•

changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts;

•

sales or acquisitions of common stock by our directors or executive management; and

•

investor perceptions and expectations regarding our products, plans and strategic position, and those of our competitors and customers.

Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.

Our corporate headquarters and our primary corporate disaster center are located in the Los Angeles, California area and our primary corporate
disaster recovery data center is in Las Vegas, Nevada, each of which is near a major earthquake fault. A major earthquake or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of
any of our critical business or information technology systems, or otherwise prevents us from conducting our normal business operations, could require significant expenditures to resume operations and
negatively impact our business. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with such events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain.
Further, our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Any such event could also limit the ability of
retailers, distributors or our other customers to sell or distribute our products.

If general economic conditions decline, demand for our products could decline.

Purchases of our products and services involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers. Consumers are generally more willing to make
discretionary purchases, including purchases of products and services like ours, during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. As a result, our products are sensitive to general
economic conditions and economic cycles. A reduction or shift in domestic or international consumer spending could result in an increase in our selling and promotional expenses, in an effort to offset
that reduction, and could negatively impact our business.

Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

The
only facilities currently owned by the Company are two European warehouses utilized by the Distribution segment, located in Burglengenfeld, Germany and Venlo, the Netherlands.

We
anticipate no difficulty in extending the leases of our facilities or obtaining comparable facilities in suitable locations, as needed, and we consider our facilities to be adequate
for our current needs.

Item 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are party to routine claims, suits, investigations, audits, and other proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business, including
with respect to intellectual property rights, contractual claims, labor and employment matters, regulatory matters, tax matters, unclaimed property matters, compliance matters, and collection matters.

10b5-1 Stock Trading Plans

The Company's directors and employees may, at a time they are not aware of material non-public information, enter into plans to purchase or sell
shares of our common stock that satisfy the requirements of Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 ("Rule 10b5-1 Plans"). Rule 10b5-1 Plans permit persons whose ability to purchase or sell our
common stock may otherwise be substantially restricted (by quarterly and special stock-trading blackouts and by their possession from time to time of material nonpublic information) to trade on a
pre-arranged, "automatic-pilot" basis.

Trading
under Rule 10b5-1 Plans is subject to certain conditions, including that the person for whom the plan is created (or anyone else aware of material non-public information
acting on such person's behalf) not exercise any subsequent influence regarding the amount, price and dates of transactions under the plan. In addition, the Company requires Rule 10b5-1 Plans
to be established and maintained in accordance with the Company's "Policy on Establishing and Maintaining 10b5-1 Trading Plans."

Trades
under a Rule 10b5-1 Plan by our directors and employees are not necessarily indicative of their respective opinions of our current or potential future performance at the
time of the trade. Trades by our directors and executive officers pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the SEC, in
accordance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities

On February 2, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to
$1 billion of our common stock during the two-year period from February 13, 2017 through February 12, 2019.

On
February 3, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant under which we were authorized to repurchase up to $750 million of the Company's common
stock during the two-year period from February 9, 2015 through February 8, 2017. There were no repurchases pursuant to this program.

During
the third quarter of 2016, we early adopted an accounting standard which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments. The standard, among other things,
requires excess tax benefits and shortfalls associated with share-based payments to be reported within operating activities instead of financing activities, as was required under previous guidance. We
elected to apply this guidance retrospectively for all periods presented resulting in increases in our operating cash flows of $67 million, $39 million, $29 million, and
$5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, when compared to prior periods.

(2)

Cash
and investments consists of cash and cash equivalents along with short-term and long-term investments. We had short-term and long-term investments of
$13 million and $13 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016, $8 million and $9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015, $10 million and
$9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2014, $33 million and $9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2013, and $416 million and $8 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2012. Cash and investments as of December 31, 2015 excludes $3,561 million of cash placed in escrow for the King Acquisition.

Item 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Business Overview

Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and
distribute content and services across all of the major gaming platforms, including video game consoles, PC, and mobile devices.

The King Acquisition

On February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion, as further
described in Note 21 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of King commencing on February 23, 2016.

Reportable Segments

Based upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable operating segments: Activision, Blizzard, and King.

(i)    Activision

Activision is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly in console gaming. Activision
primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads, including full-game sales and in-game purchases, as well as licenses of software to third-party or related-party companies that
distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets and sells products which are principally based on our internally developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties.

(ii)   Blizzard

Blizzard is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly in PC gaming. Blizzard primarily
delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads, including subscriptions, full-game sales, and in-game purchases, as well as licenses of software to third-party or related-party
companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content, online social connectivity across
all Blizzard games, and the creation of user-generated content for Blizzard games.

(iii)  King

King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly on mobile platforms, such as Android and iOS.
King also distributes its content and services on online social platforms, such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King's games are free-to-play, however players can acquire in-game virtual items,
either with virtual currency the players purchase, or directly using real currency.

(iv)  Other

We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:

•

The MLG business, which is devoted to esports and builds on our competitive gaming efforts by celebrating the success of our players and
creating ways to deliver a best-in-class fan experience



across
games, platforms, and geographies with a long-term strategy of monetization through advertising, sponsorships, tournaments, and premium content;

•

The Studios business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our extensive library of iconic and globally
recognized intellectual properties; and

•

The Distribution business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to
third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Business Results and Highlights

Financial Results

The Company's 2016 financial highlights include:

•

2016 consolidated net revenues increased 42% to $6.6 billion and 2016 consolidated operating income increased 7% to $1.4 billion,
inclusive of King's results of operations since the King Closing Date, as compared to consolidated net revenues of $4.7 billion and consolidated operating income of $1.3 billion in 2015.

•

Revenues from digital online channels increased 94% to $4.9 billion in 2016, as compared to $2.5 billion in 2015.

•

Operating margin was 21.4% for 2016, compared with 28.3% in 2015. The lower margin was driven primarily by amortization of intangible assets
acquired in the King Acquisition.

•

We generated cash flows from operating activities of approximately $2.2 billion in 2016, an increase of 71% as compared to
$1.3 billion in 2015.

•

Consolidated net income increased 8% to $966 million in 2016, as compared to $892 million in 2015.

•

Our diluted earnings per common share increased 8% to $1.28 in 2016, as compared to $1.19 in 2015.

Since
certain of our games are hosted or include online functionality that represents an essential component of gameplay and, as a result, a more-than-inconsequential separate
deliverable, we initially defer the software-related revenues from the sale of these games and recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less
than a year. Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 include a net effect of $9 million from the recognition of deferred net revenues.

Also,
for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the King Acquisition, our net revenues include $1.5 billion and our net income includes a net loss of
$230 million from King's operations, after adjustments for purchase price accounting, inclusive of amortization of intangible assets, share-based payments, and deferral of revenues and related
cost of revenues. The majority of these U.S. GAAP accounting charges do not impact the economics or operating cash flows of our business, although they had a material impact on our 2016
U.S. GAAP results and will have a material impact on our 2017 U.S. GAAP results.

Release Highlights

Games and digital downloadable content released, among others, during the year ended December 31, 2016
included:

•

Four downloadable content packs for

Call of Duty: Black Ops III

;



•

Three content packs for

Hearthstone

;

•

Overwatch

;

•

Farm Heroes Super Saga™

;

•

World of Warcraft: Legion™

;

•

Destiny: Rise of Iron

(expansion pack for

Destiny

);

•

Skylanders Imaginators

; and

•

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare™

, featuring

Modern
Warfare® Remastered.

Monthly Active Users ("MAUs"): Measuring the Size and Engagement of Our User Base

We monitor MAUs as a key measure of the overall size of our user base and its regular engagement with our portfolio of games. MAUs are the
number of individuals who played a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that
total by the number of months in the period. An individual who plays two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual
who plays the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an individual who plays the same game on two platforms or devices in the
relevant period would generally be counted as a single user.

The
number of MAUs for a given period can be significantly impacted by the timing of new content releases, since new releases may cause a temporary surge in MAUs. Accordingly, although
we believe that overall trending in the number of MAUs can be a meaningful performance metric, period-to-period fluctuations may not be indicative of longer-term trends. The following table details
our average MAUs on a sequential quarterly basis for our reportable segments (amounts in millions):

Average
MAUs decreased by 35 million, or 7%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in King's
average MAUs is due to decreases across King's franchises that are largely attributable to less engaged users leaving the network. The increase in Activision's average MAUs is reflective of the launch
of

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare

in November 2016 along with

Call of Duty: Black Ops III

continuing to
have strong MAU retention relative to previous releases.

Average
MAUs decreased by 83 million, or 16%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in King's
average MAUs is due to decreases across King's franchises that are largely attributable to less engaged users leaving the network. This decrease is partially offset by the increase in Blizzard's
average MAUs, driven by the release of

Overwatch

in May 2016.

International Sales

International sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop content that is
specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 48%, 48%, and 50% of our



total
consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries is generated by consumers in
Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international
business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate volatility and changes in local economies. Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes
in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local economies.

Management's Overview of Business Trends

Interactive Entertainment and Mobile Gaming Growth

Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry. Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and
we estimate the total industry has grown, on average, 19% annually over the last four years. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment
becomes more common place across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.

Further,
the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable market for gaming significantly. Smart
phones and associated free-to-play games have introduced gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowed gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is now estimated to be larger
than console and PC gaming and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games. In addition, our other segments have mobile efforts underway that
present the opportunity for us to drive additional player investment from our franchises.

Opportunities To Expand Franchises Outside of Games

Our fans spend significant time investing in our franchises through purchases of our game content, whether through purchases of full games or
downloadable content or via microtransactions. Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emerging opportunities to drive player investment outside of game purchases.
These opportunities include esports, film and television, and consumer products. Our efforts to build these additional opportunities are still relatively nascent, but we view them as potentially
significant sources of future revenues.

Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises

The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive software industry. According to The
NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 32% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2016. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues has historically been
derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games were responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush,
World of Warcraft, and Overwatch franchises, collectively, accounted for 69% of our consolidated net revenues, and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income, for 2016.

The
top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. Of the top 10 console franchises in 2016, all
10 are from established franchises. Similarly, according to U.S rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play store per App Annie Intelligence, the top 10 mobile games have an average tenure of
24 months.

In
addition to investing in and developing sequels and content for our top titles, we are continually exploring additional ways to expand those franchises. Further, we invest in new
properties in an effort to develop the future top franchises. In 2014, we released

Hearthstone

and

Destiny

, in 2015, we released



Heroes of the Storm

, and on May 24, 2016, we released

Overwatch

. There is no guarantee these investments will result in
established franchises. Additionally, to diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase our presence in the mobile market, on February 23, 2016, we acquired King.

Overall,
we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our, and the industry's, revenues and profits in the
near future. Accordingly, our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against our competitors' top franchises can significantly impact our performance.

Recurring Revenue Business Models and Seasonality

Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business to a more
recurring and year-round model. Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year. This
incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenue, it can also increase engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal.

While
our business is transitioning to a year-round engagement model, the interactive entertainment industry remains somewhat seasonal. We have historically experienced our highest sales
volume, particularly for Activision, in the year-end holiday buying season, which occurs in the fourth quarter. As we make the shift to a year-round model and also now include the operating results of
King, which focuses on free-to-play games, less of our revenues are coming from the fourth quarter. For our reportable segments—Activision, Blizzard, and King—the percentage of
our revenue represented by the fourth quarter in 2016 decreased by 10% year-over-year to 36%, compared with 46% in 2015.

Outlook

In 2017, we will have a lighter slate of full-game releases than 2016, which we expect to result in lower revenues and earnings per share than
we had in 2016. For Activision, we do expect to release the first sequel to

Destiny

and a new Call of Duty title in the second half of the year,
however, our Skylanders franchise will not have a new full console game launch in 2017. Across our businesses, we will continue to focus on our opportunities for year-round player engagement and
investment.

While
our results for 2017 will include the full-year operations of King, the expected results will continue to be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King
Acquisition, which include, among other things, integration and acquisition-related costs, the amortization of intangible assets resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments, and the related
tax impact from the King Acquisition. While the majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics or operating cash flows of our business, they will have a material impact on our
GAAP results.

Finally,
one of our current initiatives is to create an esports equivalent of the world's established major professional sport leagues. This may provide for additional opportunities in
2017 through strategically important emerging new revenue streams, including possible team sales for the Overwatch League

™

, the associated
media rights, and in-game advertising.

In
periods prior to the second quarter of 2016, we presented cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations using the following four financial
statement captions: "Cost of sales—product costs," "Cost of sales—online," "Cost of sales—software royalties and amortization," and "Cost of
sales—intellectual property licenses." Since the second quarter of 2016, we have revised the presentation in our consolidated statements of operations to more clearly align our costs of
revenues with the associated revenue captions as follows:

(i)

"Product
costs"—includes the manufacturing cost of goods produced and sold. This generally includes product costs, manufacturing royalties, net of volume
discounts, personnel-related costs, warehousing, and distribution costs. We generally recognize volume discounts when they are earned (typically in connection with the achievement of unit-based
milestones).

(ii)

"Software
royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses"—includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties
attributable to product sales revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are released, at



which
time the capitalized costs are amortized. Also included is amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting attributable to product sales revenues.

Cost
of revenues—subscription, licensing, and other revenues:

(i)

"Game
operations and distribution costs"—includes costs to operate our games, such as customer service, internet bandwidth and server costs, platform
provider fees, and payment provider fees.

(ii)

"Software
royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses"—includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties
attributable to subscription, licensing and other revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are released, at which time the capitalized costs are amortized.
Also included is amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting attributable to subscription, licensing, and other revenues.

Prior
periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

(2)

Represents
the loss on extinguishment of debt we recognized during 2016 as a result of the extinguishment of certain term loan and senior note facilities through our
refinancing activities, comprised of a premium payment of $63 million and write-off of unamortized discount and financing costs of $29 million.

Consolidated net revenues

2016 vs. 2015

The
increase in consolidated net revenues for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

•

New revenues from King titles following the King Closing Date, primarily driven by the Candy Crush franchise.

•

Revenues recognized from

Overwatch

, a new team-based first-person shooter released in May 2016.

•

Higher revenues recognized in 2016 from

Call of Duty: Black Ops III

, which was released in the
fourth quarter of 2015 and was the third game in our successful Black Ops series, as compared to revenues recognized in 2015 from

Call of Duty: Advanced
Warfare

, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2014, including, in each case, the associated digital content.

The
increase was partially offset by:

•

Lower revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise, as

Destiny

debuted in September 2014 but
had no comparable full-game release in 2015.



•

Lower revenues from

Skylanders Imaginators

, which was released in October 2016, as compared to

Skylanders
Superchargers

, the comparable 2015 title, as well as lower revenues from standalone toys and accessories from the Skylanders franchise in
2016.

•

Lower revenues recognized from the Diablo franchise due to the timing of releases.

2015 vs. 2014

The
increase in consolidated net revenues for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to:

•

Higher revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise, as

Destiny

debuted in September 2014.

•

Higher revenues recognized from

Hearthstone

, which were partially driven by its incremental
release on iPhone and Android smartphones in April 2015.

The
increase was partially offset by:

•

Lower revenues from

Skylanders SuperChargers

, as compared to

Skylanders
Trap Team

, the comparable 2014 title.

•

Lower revenues recognized from

Diablo III: Reaper of Souls™

and

Diablo III: Reaper of
Souls—Ultimate Evil Edition™

, which were released in March 2014 on PC and in August 2014 on consoles,
respectively.

Change in Deferred Revenues Recognized

2016 vs. 2015

The
decrease in net deferred revenues recognized for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

•

Deferrals of revenues associated with the release of

World of Warcraft: Legion

in August 2016,
as compared to the recognition of deferred revenues in 2015 from the release of

World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor®

in November 2014.

•

Deferrals of revenues associated with

Overwatch.

The
decrease was partially offset by lower deferrals of revenues associated with the Call of Duty franchise, driven by lower revenue deferrals from

Call of Duty:
Infinite Warfare

, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2016, as compared to

Call of Duty: Black Ops III

, the comparable
2015 title.

2015 vs. 2014

The
increase in net deferred revenues recognized for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to:

•

Lower deferrals of revenues from the

Destiny

franchise, which debuted in September 2014.

•

Lower deferrals of revenues from

World of Warcraft

, primarily associated with

World of Warcraft: Warlords
of Draenor

, which was released in November 2014, and value-added services

The
increase was partially offset by higher deferrals of revenues from the Call of Duty franchise.

Foreign Exchange Impact

Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $81 million, $373 million, and $2 million on Activision
Blizzard's consolidated net revenues in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the previous year. The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S.
dollar relative to the euro and British pound.



Operating Segment Results

Currently, we have three reportable operating segments. Our operating segments are consistent with the manner in which our operations are
reviewed and managed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of: the impact of the change in deferred
revenues and related cost of revenues with respect to certain of our online-enabled games; share-based compensation expense; amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting;
and fees and other expenses (including legal fees, expenses and accruals) related to acquisitions, associated integration activities, and financings. The CODM does not review any information regarding
total assets on an operating segment basis, and accordingly, no disclosure is made with respect thereto.

Our
operating segments are also consistent with our internal organization structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the availability of separate
financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments.

Information
on the operating segments and reconciliations of total segment net revenues and total segment operating income to consolidated net revenues from external customers and
consolidated



income
before income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 are presented in the table below (amounts in millions):

(1)

Other
segments include other income and expenses from operating segments managed outside the reportable segments, including our MLG, Studios, and Distribution
businesses. Other segments also include unallocated corporate income and expenses.

(2)

We
have determined that some of our titles' online functionality represents an essential component of gameplay and as a result, represents a
more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable. As such, we are required to recognize revenues from these titles over the estimated service periods, which are generally less than one year. The related
cost of revenues are deferred and recognized when the related revenues are recognized. In the operating segment results table, we reflect the net effect from the deferral of revenues and (recognition)
of deferred revenues, along with the related cost of revenues, on certain of our online enabled products.



(3)

We
expense our share-based awards using the grant date fair value over the vesting periods of the stock awards. In the case of liability awards, the liability is
subject to revaluation based on the stock price at the end of the relevant period. Included within this share-based compensation are the net effects of capitalization, deferral, and amortization.

(4)

We
amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of consumption of the underlying economic benefits. The amounts presented in the
table represent the effect of the amortization of intangible assets, as well as other purchase price accounting adjustments, where applicable, in our consolidated statements of operations.

(5)

We
incurred fees and other expenses, such as legal, banking and professional services fees, related to (a) the October 11, 2013 repurchase of
approximately 429 million shares of our common stock (the "Purchase Transaction"), pursuant to a stock purchase agreement among us, Vivendi and ASAC II LP, an exempted limited
partnership established under the laws of the Cayman Islands, acting by its general partner, ASAC II LLC, (b) the King Acquisition, and (c) other business acquisitions and
associated integration activities, in each case, inclusive of any related debt financings. Such expenses are not reviewed by the CODM as part of segment performance.

Segment Net Revenues

Activision

2016 vs. 2015

The
decrease in Activision's net revenues for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

•

Lower revenues from

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare

, which was released in the fourth quarter of
2016, as compared to

Call of Duty: Black Ops III

, the comparable 2015 title, which was the third game in our successful Black Ops series.

•

Lower revenues from the Destiny franchise, as there were two expansion packs in 2015—

House of
Wolves

and

The Taken King

—but only one in 2016—

Rise of
Iron

.

•

Lower revenues from

Skylanders Imaginators

, which was released in October 2016, as compared to

Skylanders
Superchargers

, the comparable 2015 title, as well as lower revenues from standalone Skylanders toys and accessories in 2016.

•

Lower revenues from

Guitar Hero Live

, which was released in 2015 with no comparable release in
2016.

The
decrease was partially offset by higher revenues from digital content associated with

Call of Duty: Black Ops III

, as compared to

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare

, the comparable 2014 title.

2015 vs. 2014

The
increase in Activision's net revenues for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to:

•

Higher revenues from the Call of Duty franchise, specifically from

Call of Duty: Black Ops III

,
which was released in the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare

, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2014.

•

Strong digital content performance, including expansion packs and supply drops for

Call of Duty: Advanced
Warfare.

•

Revenues from

Guitar Hero Live

, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2015, with no
comparable release in 2014.



The
increase was partially offset by:

•

Lower revenues from

Skylanders SuperChargers

, which was released in 2015, as compared to

Skylanders Trap Team

, the comparable 2014 title.

•

Lower revenues from the Destiny franchise, as

Destiny

debuted in September 2014 with no
comparable full-game release in 2015.

•

Lower revenues from

The Amazing Spider-Man™ 2

, which was released during 2014, with
no corresponding releases during 2015.

Blizzard

2016 vs. 2015

The
increase in Blizzard's net revenues for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

•

Revenues from

Overwatch

, a new team-based first-person shooter released in May 2016.

•

Higher revenues from

World of Warcraft

, driven by the release of

World
of Warcraft: Legion

in August 2016, with no comparable release in 2015.

2015 vs. 2014

The
decrease in Blizzard's net revenues for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to the timing of releases,
including:

•

Diablo III: Reaper of Souls

, which was released in March 2014 on the PC, and

Diablo III: Reaper of Souls-Ultimate Evil Edition

, which was released in August 2014 on consoles.

•

World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor

, which was released in November 2014, along with the
overall lower revenues from

World of Warcraft

due to a smaller subscriber base.

The
decrease was partially offset by:

•

Higher revenues from

Hearthstone

, which had multiple content releases throughout the year, and
benefited from its incremental release on iPhone and Android smartphones in April 2015.

•

Revenues from

Heroes of the Storm

and

StarCraft II: Legacy of the
Void™

, which were released in 2015.

King

King's net revenues represent the net revenues from the King Closing Date through December 31, 2016. The revenues were primarily driven
by the Candy Crush franchise, which included the release of

Candy Crush Jelly Saga™

in January 2016.

Segment Income from Operations

Activision

2016 vs. 2015

The
decrease in Activision's operating income for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to lower revenues. This was partially offset
by:

•

Lower sales and marketing spend on

Guitar Hero Live

and the Destiny franchise given the timing
of game launches.



•

The relative increase in revenues coming from the digital online channel, which typically has a higher profit margin.

2015 vs. 2014

The
increase in Activision's operating income for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to:

•

The relative increase in revenues coming from the digital online channel, which typically has a higher profit margin.

•

Lower sales and marketing spending on the Destiny franchise because of the September 2014 launch of

Destiny

, with no comparable
full-game release in 2015.

The
increase was partially offset by:

•

Operating losses from

Guitar Hero Live

, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2015, with
no comparable release in 2014.

•

Lower revenues from

Skylanders SuperChargers

, as compared to

Skylanders
Trap Team.

Blizzard

2016 vs. 2015

The
increase in Blizzard's operating income for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to higher revenues. This was partially offset
by:

•

New sales and marketing spending to support

Overwatch.

•

Higher personnel costs due to segment performance bonuses and increased headcount to support the business growth.

2015 vs. 2014

The
decrease in Blizzard's operating income for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to:

•

Lower revenues.

•

Higher cost of revenues from

Hearthstone

related to commissions on mobile purchases following
the launch on iPhone and Android smartphones in April 2015.

•

Higher sales and marketing spending for releases, including

Hearthstone

and

Heroes of the
Storm.

•

Lower capitalization of software development costs and higher software amortization.

King

King's operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 represents the operating income from the King Closing Date through
December 31, 2016.

Foreign Exchange Impact

Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $30 million and $338 million on reportable segment net revenues for
2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the previous year. The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and British pound.

but had no comparable full-game release in 2015.

2015 vs 2014

The
increase in net deferred revenues recognized for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to lower deferrals of revenues from

Destiny.

The increase was partially offset by higher deferrals of
revenues from the Call of Duty franchise.

Cost of Revenues—Product Sales:

2016 vs 2015

The
decrease in product costs for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

•

Lower product costs associated with the Skylanders franchise.

•

The relative increase in revenues coming from the digital online channel, which typically have relatively lower product costs.

The
decrease in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to product sales for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to lower software
amortization from the Destiny franchise, as

Destiny

was released in the third quarter of 2014, but had no comparable full-game release in 2015.

This
decrease was partially offset by:

•

Software amortization from

Overwatch

, which was released in May 2016 with no comparable 2015
title.

•

Higher software amortization associated with

Call of Duty: Black Ops III

, which was released in
the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare

, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2014.

2015 vs 2014

The
decrease in product costs for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to:

•

The relative increase in revenues coming from the digital online channel, which typically have relatively lower product costs.

•

Decreased product costs as a result of the decrease in revenues from our relatively lower-margin Distribution business.



The increase in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to product sales for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to
higher software amortization from the Destiny franchise.

Cost of Revenues—Subscription, Licensing, and Other Revenues:

2016 vs 2015

The
increase in game operations and distribution costs for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

•

Increased online costs and platform provider fees associated with revenues from King titles included since the King Closing Date.

•

Increased expenditures to support our growing online activity across our existing and new titles.

The
increase in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to subscription, licensing, and other revenues for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily
due to the amortization of internally-developed franchise intangible assets acquired in the King Acquisition. This increase was partially offset by lower software amortization from

Heroes of the Storm

,
as it was released in June 2015.

2015 vs 2014

The
increase in game operations and distribution costs for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to increased online costs and platform provider fees associated
with revenues from

Hearthstone

, which was released on iPhone and Android smartphones in April 2015.

The
increase in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to subscription, licensing, and other revenues for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily
due to software amortization from

•

Sales and marketing spending to support King's titles and new launches, including

Candy Crush Jelly Saga

and

Farm Heroes Super Saga

.

•

Sales and marketing spending to support Blizzard's new title,

Overwatch.

The
increase was partially offset by lower sales and marketing expenditures on

Guitar Hero Live

and the Destiny franchise given the timing
of game launches.

2015 vs 2014

The
increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to increased spending on sales and marketing activities to support the
launches of

Guitar Hero Live

and

Heroes of the Storm

during the year. The increase was partially offset
by lower media spending on the World of Warcraft, Destiny, and Diablo franchises due to the timing of title releases.

2016 vs 2015

The
increase in general and administrative expenses for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

•

King's general and administrative costs, which are included from the King Closing Date.

•

Higher Blizzard personnel costs due to segment performance bonuses and increased headcount to support the growth of the Blizzard business.

•

Higher professional and transaction-related fees due to the King Acquisition, which closed on February 23, 2016.

•

Lower foreign currency transaction and derivative contract gains.

2015 vs 2014

The
decrease in general and administrative expenses for 2015, as compared to 2014, was primarily due to realized and unrealized gains from our foreign currency
derivative contracts and lower share-based compensation expense. This decrease was partially offset by increased professional service fees incurred, primarily in connection with the King Acquisition.

2016 vs 2015

The
increase in interest and other expense, net, for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to interest expense associated with the new $2.3 billion
tranche of term loans "A" that were incurred in connection with the King Acquisition. This increase was partially offset by lower interest expense related to our prior term loan because of
voluntary prepayments on the principal we made throughout 2016, with the prior term loan being fully extinguished in September 2016. Refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below as included in
Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding our debt activities.

For
the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company's income before income tax expense was $1,106 million, $1,121 million, and $981 million,
respectively, and our income tax expense was $140 million (or a 13% effective tax rate), $229 million (or a 20% effective tax rate), and $146 million (or a 15% effective tax
rate), respectively. Overall, our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to earnings taxed at relatively lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, recognition of
excess tax benefits from shared-based payments (as discussed further below), recognition of the research and development ("R&D") credits, partially offset by changes in the Company's liability for
uncertain tax positions.

In
2016 and 2015, our U.S. income before income tax expense was $228 million and $355 million, respectively, and comprised 21% and 32%, respectively, of our consolidated
income before income tax expense. In 2016 and 2015, our foreign income before income tax expense was $878 million and $766 million, respectively, and comprised 79% and 68%, respectively,
of our consolidated income before income tax expense.

In
2016 and 2015, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, as compared to domestic earnings taxed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, lowered our effective tax rate by
22 percentage points and 20 percentage points, respectively. The increase in the foreign rate differential is due to the overall increase in foreign income, which is taxed at relatively lower rates in
proportion to U.S. income.

In
2015 and 2014, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, as compared to domestic earnings taxed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, lowered our effective tax rate by
20 percentage points and 25 percentage points, respectively. The decrease in the foreign rate differential is due to overall increase in foreign income in higher statutory rate jurisdictions, as
compared to the prior year.



The
overall effective income tax rate in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, such as changes in the mix of income by tax jurisdiction, applicable accounting rules,
applicable tax laws and regulations, and rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audits and other matters, and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre-tax income or
loss. Further, the effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected by the extent that income (loss) before income tax expenses (benefit) is lower
than anticipated in foreign regions, where taxes are levied at relatively lower statutory rates, and/or higher than anticipated in the United States, where taxes are levied at relatively higher
statutory rates.

Further
analysis of the differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective tax rate, as well as other information about our income taxes, is provided in
Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, see "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" for
discussion on our early adoption of a new accounting standard related to share-based payments that requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded as an income tax expense or
benefit in the consolidated statement of operations. As a result, we recognized $81 million as a reduction to income tax expense in 2016. Conversely, in 2015 and 2014, $65 million and
$30 million, respectively, were credited to shareholders' equity.

Foreign Exchange Impact

Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $10 million, a negative impact of $242 million, and a negative impact
of $8 million on Activision Blizzard's consolidated operating income in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to
the euro and British pound and its impact on our foreign operating income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. In the near term, we
expect our business to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows. Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as our
anticipated dividend payments, share repurchases and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating
activities. With our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.3 billion at December 31, 2016, and the expected cash flows provided by our operating activities, we
believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet daily operations for the foreseeable future. We also believe that we have sufficient working capital ($2.2 billion at December 31, 2016)
to finance our operational and financing requirements for at least the next twelve months. Additionally, we have the availability of a $250 million revolving credit facility.

As
of December 31, 2016, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $1.9 billion, as compared to $0.5 billion
as of December 31, 2015. If the cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are needed in the future for our operations in the U.S., we would accrue and pay the required U.S. taxes to
repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.

Furthermore,
our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the
fourth quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including
acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, share repurchases, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.

Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities

The primary drivers of cash flows associated with our operating activities include the collection of customer receivables generated from the
sale of our products and services. These collections are typically partially offset by: payments to vendors for the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of our products; payments for customer
service support for our consumers; payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders; payments for interest on our debt; payments for software development; payments for tax
liabilities; and payments to our workforce.

2016 vs 2015

Cash
flows provided by operating activities for 2016 were $2.16 billion, as compared $1.26 billion for 2015. The increase was primarily due
to:

•

New operating cash flows contributed by King.

•

Higher net income in 2016, as compared to 2015, along with larger adjustments to net income for non-cash charges, primarily associated with the
amortization of the acquired intangibles in the King Acquisition, higher stock compensation expense due to converted awards for King personnel in the acquisition, and other non-cash or non-operating
costs associated with our debt-related activities during the year.

Cash
flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $209 million of interest paid on our outstanding debt, as compared to
$193 million paid in 2015.

2015 vs 2014

Cash
flows provided by operating activities for 2015 were $1.26 billion, as compared to $1.33 billion for 2014. The decrease was primarily due to changes in
operating assets and liabilities, driven by the 2014 cash flows benefiting from a substantial increase in revenues that were deferred. The decrease



was
partially offset by higher net income in 2015, as compared to 2014, along with larger adjustments to net income for non-cash charges, including amortization of capitalized software development
costs.

Cash
flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $193 million of interest paid on our outstanding debt, as compared to
$201 million paid in 2014.

Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities

The primary drivers of cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, changes in restricted cash
balances, and cash used for acquisitions.

2016 vs 2015

Cash
flows used in investing activities for 2016 were $1.18 billion, as compared to $3.72 billion for 2015. The lower amount of cash used in investing
activities in 2016 was primarily due to a 2015 cash outflow of $3.6 billion for cash placed into escrow to facilitate the King Acquisition. In 2016, when we acquired King, the cash in escrow
became a cash inflow. As a result, in 2016 we had a $2.2 billion cash outflow for the King Acquisition in excess of the cash already in escrow, net of $1.15 billion of cash acquired from
King.

2015 vs 2014

Cash
flows used in investing activities for 2015 were $3.72 billion, as compared to $82 million used in 2014. The higher amount of cash used in investing
activities in 2015 was primarily due to the $3.6 billion of cash deposited in escrow to facilitate the King Acquisition, as well as the cash used to acquire Major League Gaming in the fourth
quarter of 2015.

Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities

The primary drivers of cash flows used in financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and
transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of options, as well as the payment of dividends.

2016 vs 2015

Cash
flows provided by financing activities for 2016 were $500 million, as compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $202 million for 2015. The
difference was
primarily due to $6.9 billion of proceeds received from the following debt issuances in 2016:

•

Issuance of a $2.3 billion tranche of term loans "A" on February 23, 2016 to fund the King Acquisition.

•

Issuance of an additional $250 million tranche of term loans "A" on March 31, 2016.

•

Issuance of a new unsecured $2.9 billion tranche of term loans "A" in connection with the fifth amendment to our credit agreement on
August 23, 2016.

•

Issuance of $650 million of 2.3% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 on September 19, 2016.

•

Issuance of $850 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes due September 2026 on September 19, 2016.



These
issuances were partially offset by:

•

Repayments of $1.9 billion to extinguish our term loan outstanding at December 31, 2015 (the "Original Term Loan").

•

Repayments of $2.5 billion in connection with the refinancing of our tranche of term loans "A" that were provided in the first
quarter of 2016.

•

Repayments of $185 million on our new tranche of term loans "A" that were provided on August 23, 2016, which included
$167 million of voluntary prepayments, as compared to the $250 million partial repayment of our Original Term Loan in 2015.

•

Cash payment to redeem our 5.625% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the "Original 2021 Notes") of $1.5 billion, as well as the
associated $63 million premium.

•

Higher cash dividend payments made during 2016, as compared to 2015.

Cash
flows used in financing activities for 2015 also included proceeds of $202 million received in the settlement of the litigation related to the Purchase Transaction. There were no
such proceeds received in 2016.

2015 vs 2014

Cash
flows used in financing activities for 2015 were $202 million, as compared to $413 million for 2014. The lower amount of cash flows used in financing
activities was primarily due to:

•

Proceeds of $202 million received in the settlement of the litigation related to the Purchase Transaction.

•

A lower partial repayment of our Original Term Loan during 2015 of $250 million, as compared to the $375 million partial
repayment of our Original Term Loan during 2014.

These
decreases were partially offset by:

•

Lower proceeds from stock options exercised by our employees during 2015 than during 2014.

•

Higher cash dividend payments made during 2015, as compared to 2014.

Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes

Changes in foreign exchange rates had negative impacts of $56 million, $366 million, and $396 million on our cash and cash
equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The change is primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and British pound.

Debt

As of December 31, 2016, our total outstanding debt was $4.9 billion, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 2.92%, as
compared to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2015, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 4.63%. During 2016, we had the following significant debt
activities:

•

Entered into three amendments to our credit agreement to provide for a $2.3 billion tranche of term loans "A" on
February 23, 2016, to fund the King Acquisition.

•

Entered into a fourth amendment to our credit agreement on March 31, 2016, to provide for an additional tranche of term loans "A" in the
amount of $250 million (together with the $2.3 billion tranche of term loans "A", the "Original TLA").



•

Made voluntary principal prepayments on the remaining balance of our Original Term Loan of $500 million, $250 million, and
$800 million on February 25, March 31, and May 26, 2016, respectively, to reduce the remaining outstanding principal balance to $319 million.

•

On August 23, 2016, entered into a fifth amendment to our credit agreement to provide for (1) a new unsecured tranche of term
loans "A" of approximately $2.9 billion (the "2016 TLA"), the proceeds of which were primarily used to extinguish the remaining outstanding principal balances of $319 million on the
Original Term Loan and $2.5 billion on the Original TLA, resulting in a write-off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of $10 million, and (2) a new unsecured
revolving credit facility of $250 million.

•

On September 19, 2016, issued $650 million of 2.3% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the "New 2021 Notes") and
$850 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes due September 2026 (the "2026 Notes" and, together with the New 2021 Notes, the "New Notes").

•

On October 19, 2016, using the proceeds from the New Notes, redeemed the Original 2021 Notes in full for $1.6 billion, which resulted in
a loss on extinguishment of approximately $82 million, comprised of a premium payment of $63 million and a write-off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of
$19 million.

•

On September 30, 2016, in addition to the required quarterly repayment of $18 million, made a voluntary prepayment on our 2016
TLA of $167 million. These payments satisfied the required quarterly principal repayments through December 31, 2018.

On
February 3, 2017, we entered into a sixth amendment to our credit agreement which (i) provided for a new tranche of term loans "A" in an aggregate principal amount of
$2.55 billion (the "2017 TLA") and (ii) released each of our subsidiary guarantors from their respective guarantee provided under the credit agreement. All proceeds of the 2017 TLA,
together with additional cash funds on hand, were used to fully prepay the 2016 TLA outstanding under the credit agreement immediately prior to the effectiveness of the sixth amendment, together with
all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The terms of the 2017 TLA, other than the absence of guarantees, are generally the same as the terms of the 2016 TLA.



On February 2, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized repayments of up to $500 million of our outstanding debt during 2017. During February 2017,
we made voluntary prepayments on our term loans of $500 million, inclusive of $139 million used to fully prepay the 2016 TLA. The voluntary prepayment satisfied the remaining required
quarterly principal repayments for the entire term of the Credit Agreement.

Refer
to Note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosures regarding terms and
activities associated with our debt obligations.

Dividends

In February 2, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, payable on May 10, 2017, to
shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2017.

Capital Expenditures

We made capital expenditures of $136 million in 2016, as compared to $111 million in 2015. In 2017, we anticipate total capital
expenditures of approximately $130 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases.

Commitments

Refer to Note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
for disclosures regarding our commitments.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2016 and 2015, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties,
often referred to as "structured finance" or "special purpose" entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes,
that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates and assumptions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. The policies, estimates, and assumptions discussed below are considered by management to be
critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because their application places the most significant demands on management's
judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies,
estimates, and assumptions are described in the following paragraphs.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the product or service has been provided to the customer, the
collection of our fees is reasonably assured, and the



amount
of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Certain products are sold to customers with a "street date" (which is the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers).
For these products, we recognize revenues on the later of the street date or the date the product is sold to the customer.

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

Certain of our revenue arrangements have multiple deliverables, which we account for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
("ASC") Topic 605. These revenue arrangements include product sales consisting of both software, service (such as ongoing hosting arrangements), and hardware deliverables (such as peripherals or other
ancillary collectors' items sold together with physical "boxed" software).

When
a revenue arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products, licenses and/or services, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price
hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") if it is available, third-party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or best estimated
selling price ("BESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. In multiple element arrangements where more-than-incidental software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit
of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the
aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Further, if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then
allocated to each software deliverable using the guidance for recognizing software revenue.

As
noted above, when neither VSOE nor TPE is available for a deliverable, we use BESP. We did not have significant revenue arrangements that required using BESP for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. The inputs we use to determine the selling price of our significant deliverables include the actual price charged by the Company for deliverables that the
Company sells separately (which represents VSOE) and the wholesale prices of the same or similar products for deliverables not sold separately (which represents TPE).

Product Sales

Product sales consists of sales of our games, including physical products and digital full-game downloads. We recognize revenues from the sale
of our products after both (1) title and risk of loss have been transferred to our customers and (2) all performance obligations have been completed. With respect to digital full-game
downloads, this is when the product is available for download or is activated for gameplay. Revenues from product sales are recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price
protection.

Product with Online Functionality or Hosted Service Arrangements

For our software products with online functionality or that are part of a hosted service arrangement, we evaluate whether that online
functionality constitutes a more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software product. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on (including
downloadable content), when it is released. Determining whether the online functionality for a particular product constitutes a more-than-inconsequential deliverable is subjective and requires
management's judgment. When we determine that the online functionality constitutes a more-than-inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product, which is principally because of
the online functionality's importance to gameplay, we consider our performance obligation for this title to extend beyond the sale of the game. In addition, VSOE of fair value does not exist for the
online functionality of some products, as we do not separately charge for this



component.
As a result, we initially defer all of the software-related revenues from the sale of any such title (including downloadable content) and recognize the revenues ratably over the estimated
service period of the title. In addition, we initially defer the cost of revenues for the title and recognize the cost of revenues as the related revenues are recognized. The cost of revenues that are
initially deferred include manufacturing costs, software royalties and amortization, and intellectual property licenses and exclude intangible asset amortization.

For
our software products with online functionality that are considered to be incidental to the overall product offering and are inconsequential deliverables, we recognize the related
revenues when the revenue recognition criteria described above have been met.

For
our

World of Warcraft

boxed products, expansion packs and value-added services, we recognize revenues in each case with the related
subscription service revenues ratably over the estimated service period, beginning upon the activation of the software and delivery of the related services. For revenues associated with the sales of
subscriptions, the revenues are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then recognized ratably over the subscription period. Revenues attributed to the sale of

World of
Warcraft

boxed software and related expansion packs are classified as "Product sales," whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and other
value-added services are classified as "Subscription, licensing, and other revenues."

Microtransaction Revenues

Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale of virtual goods and currencies to our players to enhance their gameplay experience.
Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods and currencies are initially recorded in deferred revenues. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues when a player uses the
virtual goods purchased with the virtual currency. Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods directly are also recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods. We categorize our virtual
goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual
goods as the goods are consumed. Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of durable
virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the player, which is generally the estimated service period of the game.

Estimated Service Period

We determine the estimated service period for players of our games with consideration of various data points, including the weighted-average
number of days between players' first and last date played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average number of
days between players' first purchase date and last date played online. We also consider known online trends, the service periods of our previously released games, and the service periods of our
competitors' games that are similar in nature to ours, to the extent they are publicly available. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires management's judgment. Future
usage patterns may differ from historical usage patterns and therefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service periods for players of our current games are
generally less than twelve months.

Allowances for Returns and Price Protection

We closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other publishers,
market conditions, and the anticipated timing of other releases to assess future demand of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent reorders are evaluated
with the goal of ensuring that quantities are sufficient to



meet
the demand from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel. We benchmark units to be shipped to our customers using historical and industry
data.

We
may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the circumstances in which we elect to
decrease, on a short- or longer-term basis, the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us
with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or receive price protection credits include, among other things,
compliance with applicable trading and payment terms and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell-through reports to us. We may also consider other factors, including achievement of
sell-through performance targets in certain instances, the facilitation of slow-moving inventory, and other market factors.

Significant
management judgments and estimates with respect to potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product revenues must be made and used when
establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period. We estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for current period product revenues utilizing
historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer. The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future
returns and price protection for a particular title: historical performance of titles in similar genres; historical performance of the hardware platform; historical performance of the franchise;
console hardware life cycle; sales force and retail customer feedback; industry pricing; future pricing assumptions; weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory; absolute quantity of on-hand retail
channel inventory; our warehouse on-hand inventory levels; the title's recent sell-through history (if available); marketing trade programs; and the performance of competing titles. The relative
importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other things, genre, platform, seasonality, and sales strategy.

Based
upon historical experience, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. However, actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a
number of reasons, including, among others: a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor, or technological obsolescence due to
the emergence of new hardware platforms. There may be material differences in the amount and timing of our revenues for any period if factors or market conditions change or if matters resolve in a
manner that is inconsistent with management's assumptions utilized in determining the allowances for returns and price protection. For example, a 1% change in our December 31, 2016 allowance
for sales returns, price protection, and other allowances would have impacted net revenues by approximately $3 million.

Allowance for Inventory Obsolescence

We regularly review inventory quantities on-hand and in the retail channels. We write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories
determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value, based upon
assumptions about future demand, which are inherently difficult to assess and dependent on market conditions. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is
established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established basis.

Software Development Costs

Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs
incurred for internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such



costs
are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and tested product design
and a working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established and the evaluation is performed on a
product-by-product basis. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Software development costs related to hosted service revenue arrangements are
capitalized after the preliminary project phase is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Prior to a product's
release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property
licenses." Capitalized costs for products that are cancelled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to "Product development" in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development
which are not capitalized are charged immediately to "Product development."

Commencing
upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property
licenses" based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months to approximately two years.

We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior periods, the primary evaluation
criterion is the actual performance of the title to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected
performance of the specific products to which the costs relate. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable
technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to its release; general market conditions; and, for any sequel product, estimated performance based on the performance
of the product on which the sequel is based.

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of
expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted
amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Material
differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's expectations.

Income Taxes

We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, the
provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability.
For those assets that do not meet the threshold of "more likely than not" that they will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.



Management
believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax
effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be
realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to tax expenses in the period such determination is made. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant
judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of ASC Topic 740 and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations
could have a material impact on our business and results of operations in an interim period in which the uncertainties are ultimately resolved.

Significant
judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance
can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of
changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded,
such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to
reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.

Our
provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by: (1) earnings being lower than anticipated in foreign regions where taxes are levied at
relatively lower statutory rates and/or higher than anticipated in the United States where taxes are levied at relatively higher statutory rates; (2) changes in the valuation of our deferred
tax assets and liabilities; (3) tax effects of nondeductible compensation; (4) tax costs related to intercompany realignments; (5) differences between amounts included in our tax
filings and the estimate of such amounts included in our tax expenses; (6) changes in accounting principles; or (7) changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles
or interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to multinational corporations, such as changes currently being considered in the U.S., the European Union and its member
states, and other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The
accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact
our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and are regularly subject to audit by other tax authorities. We regularly
assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these
continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

Fair Value Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item
to fairly present our consolidated financial statements. Without an independent market or another representative transaction, determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make
several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting.

There
are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value. These include: (1) the market approach, where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or
liabilities are used to determine the fair value; (2) the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, future cash flows or future earnings) to a
single present amount; and (3) the cost approach, which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset. For many of



our
fair value estimates, including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets, we use the income approach. Using the income approach requires the use of financial models, which
require us to make various estimates including, but not limited to: (1) the potential future cash flows for the asset, liability or equity instrument being measured; (2) the timing of
receipt or payment of those future cash flows; (3) the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows; and (4) the inherent risk associated with
the cash flows (that is, the risk premium). Determining these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective, and, if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income
approach turns out to be inaccurate, our financial results may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact on the estimated
fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached. For example, a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as
to whether an asset is impaired. While we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions, the following areas are the most
sensitive to the assessments:

Business Combinations.

We must estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Our
assessment of the
estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives. Furthermore, a change in the estimated
fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill, which is an asset that is not amortized. Often determining the fair value of these assets and
liabilities assumed requires an assessment of the expected use of the asset, the
expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired in-process technology. Such estimates are inherently
difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements.

Assessment of Impairment of Assets.

We evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable amortizable intangible assets and other
long-lived assets in
accordance with ASC Subtopic 360-10, which generally requires the assessment of these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists. We consider certain
events and circumstances in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets, other than indefinite-lived intangible assets, may not be recoverable,
including, but not limited to: (1) significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results; (2) significant changes in the use of the assets; (3) significant
negative industry or economic trends; (4) a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and (5) changes in our business strategy. In determining whether an
impairment exists, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets. If an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets'
carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. We did not record an
impairment charge to our definite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014.

Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") literature related to the accounting for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles provides companies an option to first perform a
qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value before performing a two-step approach to testing goodwill
for impairment for each reporting unit as part of our annual impairment test performed as of December 31. Our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that
constitute a business for which both (1) discrete financial information is available and (2) segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. ASC Topic 350
requires that the impairment test be performed at least annually by applying a fair value-based test. The first step measures for impairment by applying fair value-based tests at the reporting unit
level. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit.



To
determine the fair values of the reporting units used in the first step, we use a discounted cash flow approach. Each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of
significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include long-term growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates
based on our weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. These estimates and assumptions must be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment. Our estimates
for market growth, our market share and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external
sources, and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. If future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require
future impairment charges. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those
estimates.

In
determining the fair value of our significant reporting units—namely Activision, Blizzard, and King—we assumed discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 11.5% and
terminal growth rates of 0.0% to 4.0%, depending on the reporting unit and its specific characteristics and risk profiles. Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined the estimated fair value
of all of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of December 31, 2016. For our King reporting unit, which includes $2.7 billion of goodwill, the estimated fair value
exceeded the book value by approximately 18%, while the remaining reporting units had excesses of at least 100%. However, changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will
be a function of our future financial performance, our ability to successfully release new products and maintain our existing franchises, monetization of our user network, and changes in economic
conditions, including those which may change our discount rates and are outside of our control, could result in future impairment charges. For example, as of December 31, 2016, a 100 basis
point increase in the discount rate for our King reporting unit would reduce the percentage by which the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value to 10%.

We
test our acquired trade names for possible impairment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we concluded that no
impairment had occurred and that no impairment was reasonably likely to occur. In determining the fair value of these trade names, we assumed a discount rate of 8.5%, and royalty saving rates of
approximately 1.5%-2.0%. Changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic conditions, could
result in future impairment charges.

Share-Based Payments

We account for share-based payments in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10 and ASC Subtopic 505-50. Share-based compensation expense for
a given grant is recognized over the requisite service period (that is, the period for which the employee is being compensated) and is based on the value of share-based payment awards after a
reduction for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

We
generally estimate the value of stock options using a binomial-lattice model. This estimate is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex
and subjective variables, including our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.

We
generally determine the fair value of restricted stock rights based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of the
estimated future dividends during the vesting period in which the restricted stock rights holder will not participate. Certain restricted stock rights granted to our employees and senior management
vest based



on
the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. For performance-based restricted stock rights, each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified
performance criteria will be achieved. We amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock rights over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each
separately vesting tranche of the award. For market-based restricted stock rights, we estimate the fair value at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair
values over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of
market-based restricted stock rights at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is
rendered, the total fair value of the market-based restricted stock rights at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the
number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.

For
share-based compensation grants that are liability classified, we update our grant date valuation at each reporting period and recognize a cumulative catch-up adjustment for changes
in the value related to the requisite service already rendered.

For
a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Below are recently issued accounting pronouncements that were most significant to our accounting policy activities for fiscal 2016. For a
detailed discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements

Share-Based Payments

In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify accounting for share-based payments. The new standard, amongst other
things:

•

requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statement of
operations and that the tax effects of exercised or vested awards be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur;

•

requires excess tax benefits from share-based payments to be reported as operating activities on the statement of cash flows; and

•

permits an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate, as
currently required, or account for forfeitures when they occur.

We
elected to early adopt this new standard in the third quarter of 2016, which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of January 1, 2016. As part of the adoption, we made
certain elections, including the following:

•

to apply the presentation requirements for our consolidated statement of cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all
periods presented; and

•

to continue to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate.



As
a result of the adoption, we recognized excess tax benefits of $81 million as a reduction to income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2016. Further, given our retrospective application of the presentation requirements for our consolidated statement of cash flows related to excess tax benefits, our net cash
provided by operating activities and net cash used in financing activities increased by $67 million and $39 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, and December 31,
2014, respectively. The other provisions of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows

In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of certain cash items in the statement of cash flows. The new
standard requires, among other things, that cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities, as opposed to operating
activities as is required under existing guidance. We elected to early adopt this standard in the third quarter of 2016 and applied it retrospectively. As a result of the adoption of this standard,
our cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the $63 million premium payment from the October 19, 2016 redemption of our Original 2021
Notes. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows upon adoption for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted

Revenue recognition

In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP
guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance, providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize
revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This
guidance will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017, and can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a
cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are evaluating the adoption method, as well as the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements and related
disclosures. As previously disclosed, we believe the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard may have a significant impact on the accounting for our sales of our games with significant online
functionality for which we do not have VSOE for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided. Under the current accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements is required. This
requirement will be eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly, we may be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software, as compared to the current
requirement of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated offering period. This potential difference may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption
of this new guidance. As accounting implementation guidance and clarifications regarding this matter are still evolving, we continue to evaluate the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP
guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease and lessees will need to recognize a lease liability and a
right-of-use asset for their leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease
incentives received and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will



result
in straight-line expense, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease
accounting. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be
adopted using a modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. We are evaluating the impact of this
new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows—Restricted Cash

In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard
requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with cash and cash
equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018 and should be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted.

We
are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements. We expect there would be a significant impact to the consolidated statements
of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, as those years include, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash as a result of transferring
cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the King Acquisition and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 in connection with the King Acquisition. Under this new standard, the
restricted cash balance would be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and hence would not be included as an investing activity in the
statement of cash flows.

Item 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We transact business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates. Revenues and related expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in their respective local currencies. Primary currencies include euros,
British pounds, Australian dollars, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, and Swedish krona. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign
currency-denominated transactions results in reduced revenues, operating expenses, net income and cash flows from our international operations. Similarly, our revenues, operating expenses, net income
and cash flows will increase for our international operations if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies. Since we have significant international sales, but incur the majority of our costs
in the United States, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business. We monitor
currency volatility throughout the year.

To
mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and earnings and our foreign currency risk related to functional
currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter into currency derivative contracts, principally forward contracts. These forward contracts generally
have a maturity of less than one year. The counterparties for our currency derivative contracts are large and reputable commercial or investment banks.



The
fair value of foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period.

We
do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.

For
a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for our foreign currency forward contracts, see Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges

At December 31, 2016, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges.

At
December 31, 2015, the gross notional amount of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges was approximately $489 million. During the year
ended December 31, 2015, we reclassified $8 million of unrealized gains out of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" and into earnings due to dedesignating $250 million notional
euro to U.S. dollar cash flow hedges when it was determined the hedged transaction would not occur. As a result of the dedesignation, we entered into offsetting foreign currency forward contracts. The
dedesignated and offsetting foreign currency forward contracts remained outstanding as of December 31, 2015. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts was $11 million as
of December 31, 2015.

For
the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, pre-tax net gains associated with these forward contracts were not material.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Hedges ("Cash Flow Hedges")

At December 31, 2016, the gross notional amount of outstanding Cash Flow Hedges was approximately $346 million. The fair value of
these contracts was $22 million of net unrealized gains with remaining maturities of 12 months or less. Additionally, at December 31, 2016, we had $7 million of net
realized but unrecognized gains recorded within "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" associated with contracts that settled during the year but were deferred and will be amortized into
earnings along with the associated hedged revenues. Such amounts will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.

At
December 31, 2015, the gross notional amount of all outstanding Cash Flow Hedges was approximately $381 million. The fair value of these contracts was $4 million
of net unrealized losses as of December 31, 2015.

During
the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, there was no ineffectiveness relating to our Cash Flow Hedges. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the
amount of pre-tax net realized gains associated with these contracts that were reclassified out of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" and into earnings was not material.

In
the absence of hedging activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10% would have resulted in potential
declines of our net income of approximately $105 million. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; however, all
foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate debt under our
credit agreement. We do not currently use derivative



financial
instruments to manage interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, a hypothetical interest rate change on our variable rate debt of one percent (100 basis points) would have
changed interest expense on an annual basis by approximately $27 million and $19 million, respectively. This estimate does not include a change in interest income from our investment
portfolio that may result from such a hypothetical interest rate change nor does it include the effects of other actions that we may take in the future to mitigate this risk or any changes in our
financial structure. Refer to Note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosures regarding terms and
interest rates associated with our debt obligations.

Our
investment portfolio consists primarily of money market funds and government securities with high credit quality and short average maturities. Because short-term securities mature
relatively quickly and must be reinvested at the then-current market rates, interest income on a portfolio consisting of cash, cash equivalents, or short-term securities is more subject to market
fluctuations than a portfolio of longer-term securities. Conversely, the fair value of such a portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer-term securities. At
December 31, 2016, our $3.25 billion of cash and cash equivalents was comprised primarily of money market funds.

The
Company has determined that, based on the composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2016, there was no material interest rate risk exposure to the Company's
consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity as of that date.

Item 9A.    CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

Definition and Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to
reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is: (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC's rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company
to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. Inherent limitations to any system of disclosure controls and procedures include, but are not limited to,
the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of such controls by one or more persons. In addition, we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we
believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, and our system of controls may therefore not achieve its desired objectives under all possible future events.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures at December 31, 2016, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer concluded that, at December 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management,



including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness, as of December 31, 2016, of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2016.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

On
February 23, 2016, we completed our acquisition of King. The acquired business constituted approximately 7% of total assets and 23% of net revenues of the consolidated
financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. In accordance with SEC staff guidance permitting a company to exclude an acquired business from management's
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year in which the acquisition is completed, we excluded King from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Activision Blizzard, Inc.:

In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders' equity and of
cash flows, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial
reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

As
discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for income taxes related to share-based payments and the
manner in which it classifies certain items in the statement of cash flows in 2016.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject

F-1


to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As
described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, management has excluded King Digital Entertainment ("King") from its
assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2016. We have also excluded King
from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. King is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, Inc. whose total assets and total net revenues represent 7% and 23%,
respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.

ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Description of Business

Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services across all
of the major gaming platforms including video game consoles, personal computers ("PC"), and mobile devices. The terms "Activision Blizzard," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" are used to refer
collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

The
Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. We are the result of the 2008 business combination (the "Business
Combination") by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A. ("Vivendi"), and Vivendi Games, Inc. ("Vivendi Games"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of Vivendi. In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, Activision, Inc., was renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc.

The
common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol "ATVI."

The King Acquisition

On February 23, 2016 (the "King Closing Date"), we acquired King Digital Entertainment, a leading interactive mobile entertainment
company ("King"), by purchasing all of its outstanding shares (the "King Acquisition"), as further described in Note 21. Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of King
commencing on the King Closing Date.

Our Reportable Segments

Based on our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable operating segments as follows:

(i) Activision Publishing, Inc.

Activision Publishing, Inc. ("Activision") is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment
content, particularly in console gaming. Activision primarily delivers content through retail channels or digital downloads, including full-game sales and in-game purchases, as well as licenses of
software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets and sells products which are principally based on our internally-developed
intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties. Additionally, we have established a long-term alliance with Bungie to publish its game universe, Destiny.

Activision's

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Consolidation and Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the

F-9


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

United
States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.

Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior-year amounts to conform to the current period presentation.

The
Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued, to provide additional evidence relative to certain
estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosures.

Cost of revenues presentation

In periods prior to the second quarter of 2016, we presented cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations in four financial
statement captions: "Cost of sales—product costs," "Cost of sales—online," "Cost of sales—software royalties and amortization," and "Cost of
sales—intellectual property licenses." Since the second quarter of 2016, we have revised the presentation in our consolidated statements of operations to more clearly align our costs of
revenues with the associated revenue captions as follows:

Cost
of revenues—product sales:

(i)

"Product
costs"—includes the manufacturing costs of goods produced and sold. These generally include product costs, manufacturing royalties, net of
volume discounts, personnel-related costs, warehousing, and distribution costs. We generally recognize volume discounts when they are earned (typically in connection with the achievement of unit-based
milestones).

(ii)

"Software
royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses"—includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties
attributable to product sales revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are released, at which time the capitalized costs are amortized. Also included is
amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting attributable to product sales revenues.

Cost
of revenues—subscription, licensing, and other revenues:

(i)

"Game
operations and distribution costs"—includes costs to operate our games, such as customer service, internet bandwidth and server costs, platform
provider fee, and payment provider fees.

(ii)

"Software
royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses"—includes the amortization of capitalized software costs and royalties
attributable to subscription, licensing and other revenues. These are costs capitalized on the balance sheet until the respective games are released, at which time the capitalized costs are amortized.
Also included is amortization of intangible assets recognized in purchase accounting attributable to subscription, licensing and other revenues.

Prior
periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all money market funds and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
"Cash and cash equivalents."

Investment Securities

Investments designated as available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such securities,
if available, or is estimated on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics. Unrealized gains and losses of the Company's available-for-sale securities are
excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of "Other comprehensive income (loss)."

Investments
with original maturities greater than 90 days and remaining maturities of less than one year are normally classified within "Other current assets." In addition,
investments with maturities beyond
one year may be classified within "Other current assets" if they are highly liquid in nature and represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.

The
specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed of, with realized gains and losses reflected in "Interest and other expense (income), net" in our
consolidated statements of operations.

Cash in Escrow

As part of the King Acquisition, we were required to deposit $3.56 billion in cash to be held in an escrow account until the earlier of
(i) the completion of the King Acquisition, or (ii) the termination of the transaction agreement. The cash was not accessible to the Company for operating cash needs as its use had been
administratively restricted for use in the consummation of the King Acquisition. At December 31, 2015, we recorded the balance of the escrow account as a non-current asset, "Cash in escrow," in
our consolidated balance sheet.

Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of "Cash and cash equivalents," "Accounts receivable, net of allowances," "Accounts payable," and "Accrued expenses and
other liabilities" approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these accounts. Our investments in the United States of America ("U.S.") treasuries, government agency securities, and
corporate bonds, if any, are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices for such securities, if available, or is estimated on the basis of quoted market prices of financial
instruments with similar characteristics.

The
Company transacts business in various foreign currencies and has significant international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting us to foreign currency
risk. To mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and earnings and our foreign currency risk related to functional
currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter into currency derivative contracts, principally forward contracts. These forward contracts generally
have a maturity of less than one year. The counterparties for our currency derivative contracts are large and reputable commercial or investment banks.

F-11


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

We
assess the nature of these derivatives under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 815 to determine whether such derivatives
should be designated as hedging instruments. The fair value of foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the
period. We report the fair value of these contracts within "Other current assets," "Accrued expense and other liabilities," "Other assets," or "Other liabilities," as applicable, in our consolidated
balance sheets based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the relevant period.

We
do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.

For
foreign currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate risk from foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities, and earnings that are not designated as hedging
instruments under ASC 815, changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives are recorded within "General and administrative expenses" and "Interest and other expense, net" in our consolidated
statements of operations, consistent with the nature of the underlying transactions.

For
foreign currency forward contracts that we entered into to hedge forecasted intercompany cash flows that are subject to foreign currency risk and which have been designated as cash
flow hedges in accordance with ASC 815, we assess the effectiveness of these cash flow hedges at inception and on an ongoing basis and determine if the hedges are effective at providing offsetting
changes in cash flows of the hedged items. The Company records the effective portion of changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" and
subsequently reclassifies the related amount of accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings within "General and administrative" or "Net revenues" when the hedged item impacts earnings, consistent
with the nature and timing of the underlying transactions. Cash flows from these foreign currency forward contracts are classified in the same category as the cash flows associated with the hedged
item in the consolidated statements of cash flows. We measure hedge ineffectiveness, if any, and if it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will
discontinue hedge accounting for the derivative.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Our concentration of credit risk relates to depositors holding the Company's cash and cash equivalents and customers with significant accounts
receivable balances.

Our
cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in money market funds consisting of short-term, high-quality debt instruments issued by governments and governmental organizations,
financial institutions and industrial companies.

Our
customer base includes retailers and distributors, including mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game specialty stores in the U.S. and other
countries worldwide. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses. We generally do not require collateral or other security from our
customers.

For
the year ended December 31, 2016, we had two customers, Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. ("Sony"), and Apple, Inc., who each accounted for 13% of net revenues. For the year
ended December 31, 2015, we had two customers, Sony and Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft"), who accounted for 12% and 10%, respectively, of net revenues. We did not have any single customer
that accounted for 10% or more of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014.

ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

We
had three customers—Sony, Microsoft, and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.—who accounted for 17%, 10%, and 10%, respectively, of consolidated gross receivables at
December 31, 2016, and 18%, 13%, and 11%, respectively, of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2015.

Software Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses

Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs
incurred for internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable.
Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and tested product design and a working model. Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established and the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where
proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Software development costs related to hosted service revenue arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project phase
is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Prior to a
product's release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual
property licenses." Capitalized costs for products that are canceled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to "Product development" in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software
development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to "Product development."

Commencing
upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property
licenses" based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months to approximately two years.

Intellectual
property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks, copyrights, software, technology, music or other
intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our products. Depending upon the agreement with the rights holder, we may obtain the right to use the intellectual property in
multiple products over a number of years, or alternatively, for a single product. Prior to a product's release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as
part of "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses." Capitalized intellectual property costs for products that are canceled or are expected to
be abandoned are charged to "Product development" in the period of cancellation.

Commencing
upon a product's release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual
property licenses" based on the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed property will be utilized. As intellectual
property license contracts may extend for multiple years and can be used in multiple products to be released over a period beyond one year, the amortization of capitalized intellectual property
license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year.

We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior
periods, the

F-13


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

primary
evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the title to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on
the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed trademark or copyright is to be used. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance
include: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to its release; general market
conditions;
and, for any sequel product, estimated performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based. Further, as many of our capitalized intellectual property licenses extend for
multiple products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors, such as the success of other products
and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property, whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property, and the rights
holder's continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property.

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of
expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted
amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Material
differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's expectations.

Inventories

Inventories consist of materials (including manufacturing royalties paid to console manufacturers), labor, and freight-in and are stated at the
lower of cost (weighted-average method) or net realizable value. Inventories are relieved on a weighted-average cost method.

Long-Lived Assets

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
life
(

i.e.

, 25 to 33 years for buildings, and 2 to 5 years for computer equipment, office furniture and other equipment) of the asset. When
assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed and any resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated life of the asset, not to exceed the length of the lease. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Assets.

We account for goodwill in accordance with ASC Topic 350. Under ASC Topic 350, goodwill is
considered to
have an indefinite life, and is carried at cost. Acquired trade names are assessed as indefinite lived assets if there is no foreseeable limits on the periods of time over which they are expected to
contribute cash flows. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment test, as well as between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may not be recoverable. We perform our annual impairment testing at December 31.

F-14


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Our
annual goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. We have determined our reporting units based on the guidance within ASC Subtopic 350-20. As of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. We test goodwill for possible impairment by first determining the fair value of the related reporting
unit and comparing this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The fair value of our reporting units is determined using an income approach based on discounted
cash flow models. In the event the recorded net assets of the reporting unit exceed the estimated fair value of such assets, we perform a second step to measure the amount of the impairment, which is
equal to the amount by which the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill after assessing the fair value of each of the assets and liabilities within the reporting unit. We
have determined that no impairment has occurred at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 based upon a set of assumptions regarding discounted future cash flows, which represent our best estimate of
future performance at this time.

We
test indefinite-lived acquired trade names for possible impairment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. We have determined that no impairment has occurred at
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 based upon a set of assumptions regarding discounted future cash flows, which represent our best estimate of future performance at this time.

Changes
in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic conditions, could result in future
impairment charges.

Amortizable Intangible Assets.

Intangible assets subject to amortization are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, and
amortized over the
estimated useful life in proportion to the economic benefits received.

We
evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets in accordance with ASC Subtopic 360-10, which generally requires the assessment of these
assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists. We considered certain events and circumstances in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable
intangible assets and other long-lived assets, other than indefinite-lived intangible assets, may not be recoverable including, but not limited to: significant changes in performance relative to
expected operating results; significant changes in the use of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and
changes in our business strategy. If we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these
assets to determine whether an impairment exists. If an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets' carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as
the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. We did not record an impairment charge to our definite-lived intangible assets as of December 31,
2016, 2015, and 2014.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the product or service has been provided to the customer, the
collection of our fees is reasonably assured and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Certain products are sold to customers with a "street date" (which is the
earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we recognize revenues on the later of the street date or the date the product is sold to

F-15


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

the
customer. Revenues are recorded net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with the specific revenue-producing transaction between us and our
customer, such as sales and value-added taxes.

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

Certain of our revenue arrangements have multiple deliverables, which we account for in accordance with ASC Topic 605. These revenue
arrangements include product sales consisting of both software, service (such as ongoing hosting arrangements), and hardware deliverables (such as peripherals or other ancillary collectors' items sold
together with physical "boxed" software).

When
a revenue arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products, licenses and/or services, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price
hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") if it is available, third-party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or best estimated
selling price ("BESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. In multiple element arrangements where more-than-incidental software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit
of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the
aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Further, if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then
allocated to each software deliverable using the guidance for recognizing software revenue.

As
noted above, when neither VSOE nor TPE is available for a deliverable, we use BESP. We did not have significant revenue arrangements that required using BESP for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. The inputs we use to determine the selling price of our significant deliverables include the actual price charged by the Company for deliverables that the
Company sells separately (which represents VSOE) and the wholesale prices of the same or similar products for deliverables not sold separately (which represents TPE).

Product Sales

Product sales consist of sales of our games, including physical products and digital full-game downloads. We recognize revenues from the sale of
our products after both (1) title and risk of loss have been transferred to our customers and (2) all performance obligations have been completed. With respect to digital full-game
downloads, this is when the product is available for download or is activated for gameplay. Revenues from product sales are recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price
protection. Sales incentives and other consideration given by us to our customers, such as rebates and product placement fees, are considered adjustments of the selling price of our products and are
reflected as reductions to revenues. Sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received, such as the appearance of our products in a
customer's national circular ad, are reflected as sales and marketing expenses
when the benefit from the sales incentive is separable from sales to the same customer and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit.

F-16

Products with Online Functionality or Hosted Service Arrangements

For our software products with online functionality or that are part of a hosted service agreement, we evaluate whether that online
functionality constitutes a more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software product. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on (including
downloadable content), when it is released. Determining whether the online functionality for a particular product constitutes a more-than-inconsequential deliverable is subjective and requires
management's judgment. When we determine that the online functionality constitutes a more-than-inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product, which is principally because of
the online functionality's importance to gameplay, we consider our performance obligation for this title to extend beyond the sale of the game. In addition, VSOE of fair value does not exist for the
online functionality of some products, as we do not separately charge for this component. As a result, we initially defer all of the software-related revenues from the sale of any such title
(including downloadable content) and recognize the revenues ratably over the estimated service period of the title. In addition, we initially defer the cost of revenues for the title and recognize the
costs of sales as the related revenues are recognized. The cost of revenues that are initially deferred include manufacturing costs, software royalties and amortization, and intellectual property
licenses and exclude intangible asset amortization.

For
our software products with online functionality that we consider to be incidental to the overall product offering and are inconsequential deliverables, we recognize the related
revenues when the revenue recognition criteria described above have been met.

For
our

World of Warcraft

boxed products, expansion packs and value-added services, we recognize revenues in each case with the related
subscription service revenues ratably over the estimated service period, beginning upon the activation of the software and delivery of the related services. Revenues attributed to the sale of

World of Warcraft

boxed software and related expansion packs are classified as "Product sales," whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and other
value-added services are classified as "Subscription, licensing, and other revenues."

Subscription Revenues

Subscription revenues are mostly derived from

World of Warcraft

.

World
of Warcraft

is a game that is playable through Blizzard's servers and is generally sold on a subscription-only basis.

For

World of Warcraft

, after the first month of free usage that is included with the

World of
Warcraft

boxed software, the

World of Warcraft

end user may enter into a subscription agreement for additional future access.
Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions via boxed software and prepaid subscription cards, as well as prepaid subscriptions sales, are deferred until the subscription service is activated
by the consumer and are then recognized ratably over the subscription period. Value-added service revenues associated with subscriptions are recognized ratably over the estimated service periods.

Licensing Revenues

In certain countries, we utilize third-party licensees to distribute and host our games in accordance with license agreements, for which the
licensees pay the Company a royalty. We recognize these royalties as revenues based on usage by the end user and over the estimated service period when we

F-17


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

have
continuing service obligations. We recognize any upfront licensing fees received over the term of the agreements.

With
respect to license agreements that provide customers the right to make multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenues are generally recognized upon delivery of a
master copy if all other performance obligations have been completed or over the estimated service period when we have continuing service obligations. Per copy royalties on sales that exceed the
guarantee are recognized as earned. In addition, persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection of the related receivable must be probable.

Other Revenues

Other revenues primarily include revenues from digital downloadable content (e.g., multi-player content packs), microtransactions and the
licensing of intellectual property other than software to third-parties.

Microtransaction
revenues are derived from the sale of virtual goods and currencies to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods and
currencies are initially recorded in deferred revenues. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods purchased with the virtual
currency. Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods directly are also recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods. We categorize our virtual goods as either consumable or durable.
Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed.
Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the
period of time the goods are available to the player, which is generally the estimated service period of the game.

Revenues
from the licensing of intellectual property other than software to third-parties are recorded upon the receipt of licensee statements, or upon the receipt of cash, provided the
license period has begun and all performance obligations have been completed.

Estimated Service Period

We determine the estimated service period for players of our games with consideration of various data points, including the weighted average
number of days between players' first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average number of
days between players' first purchase date and last date played online. We also consider known online trends, the service periods of our previously released games, and the service periods of our
competitors' games that are similar in nature to ours, to the extent they are publicly available. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires management's judgment. Future
usage patterns may differ from historical usage patterns and therefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service periods for players of our current games are
generally less than 12 months.

Allowances for Returns, Price Protection, and Doubtful Accounts

We closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other publishers,
market conditions, and the anticipated timing of other

F-18


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

releases
to assess future demand of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent reorders are evaluated with the goal of ensuring that quantities are
sufficient to meet the demand from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel. We benchmark units to be shipped to our customers using
historical and industry data.

We
may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the circumstances in which we elect to
decrease, on a short- or longer-term basis, the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us
with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or receive price protection credits include, among other things,
compliance with applicable trading and payment terms and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell-through reports to us. We may also consider other factors, including achievement of
sell-through performance targets in certain instances, the facilitation of slow-moving inventory, and other market factors.

Significant
management judgments and estimates with respect to potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product revenues must be made and used when
establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period. We estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for current period product revenues utilizing
historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer. The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future
returns and price protection for a particular title: historical performance of titles in similar genres; historical performance of the hardware platform; historical performance of the franchise;
console hardware life cycle; sales force and retail customer feedback; industry pricing; future pricing assumptions; weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory; absolute quantity of on-hand retail
channel inventory; our warehouse on-hand inventory levels; the title's recent sell-through history (if available); marketing trade programs; and the performance of competing titles. The relative
importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other things, genre, platform, seasonality, and sales strategy.

Based
upon historical experience, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. However, actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a
number of reasons, including, among others: a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor, or technological obsolescence due to
the emergence of new hardware platforms. There may be material differences in the amount and timing of our revenues for any period if factors or market conditions change or if matters resolve in a
manner that is inconsistent with management's assumptions utilized in determining the allowances for returns and price protection.

Similarly,
management must make estimates as to the collectability of our accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze the age of current
outstanding account balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes in our customers' payment terms and their economic
condition, as well as whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance. Any significant changes in any of these criteria would affect management's estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful
accounts.

Allowance for Inventory Obsolescence

We regularly review inventory quantities on-hand and in the retail channels. We write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories
determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value, based upon
assumptions about future demand, which are inherently difficult to assess and dependent on market conditions. At the point of a loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is
established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established basis.

Shipping and Handling

Shipping and handling costs, which consist primarily of packaging and transportation charges incurred to move finished goods to customers, are
included in "Cost of revenues—product costs."

Advertising Expenses

We expense advertising as incurred, except for production costs associated with media advertising, which are deferred and charged to expense
when the related advertisement is run for the first time. Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $641 million, $523 million, and
$495 million, respectively, and are included in "Sales and marketing" in the consolidated statements of operations.

Income Taxes

We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, the
provision for income taxes is computed
using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability. For those assets that do not meet the
threshold of "more likely than not" that they will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.

We
report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any,
related to unrecognized tax benefits in "Income tax expense."

Foreign Currency Translation

All assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries who have a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars
at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected as a
component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in shareholders' equity.

Earnings Per Common Share

"Basic earnings per common share" is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the periods presented. "Diluted earnings per share" is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding, increased by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents are calculated using the treasury stock method and represent incremental shares issuable
upon exercise of our outstanding options. However, potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted
earnings (loss) per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded.

When
we determine whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities, unvested share-based awards which include the right to receive
non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents are considered to participate with common stock in undistributed earnings. With participating securities, we are required to calculate basic and
diluted earnings per common share amounts under the two-class method. The two-class method excludes from the earnings per common share calculation any dividends paid or owed to participating
securities and any undistributed earnings considered to be attributable to participating securities.

Share-Based Payments

We account for share-based payments in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10 and ASC Subtopic 505-50. Share-based compensation expense for
a given grant is recognized over the requisite service period (that is, the period for which the employee is being compensated) and is based on the value of share-based payment awards after a
reduction for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

We
generally estimate the value of stock options using a binomial-lattice model. This estimate is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex
and subjective variables, including our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.

We
generally determine the fair value of restricted stock rights based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of the
estimated future dividends during the vesting period in which the restricted stock rights holder will not participate. Certain restricted stock rights granted to our employees and senior management
vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. For performance-based restricted stock rights, each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the
specified performance criteria will be achieved. We amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock rights over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for
each separately vesting tranche of the award. For market-based restricted stock rights, we estimate the fair value at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those
fair values over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value
of market-based restricted stock rights at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is
rendered, the total fair value of the market-

F-21


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

based
restricted stock rights at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary
significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.

For
share-based compensation grants that are liability classified, we update our grant date valuation at each reporting period and recognize a cumulative catch-up adjustment for changes
in the value related to the requisite service already rendered.

Loss Contingencies

ASC Topic 450 governs the disclosure of loss contingencies and accrual of loss contingencies in respect of litigation and other claims. We
record an accrual for a potential loss when it is probable that a loss will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate of the potential loss is within a
range of amounts, the minimum of the range of potential loss is accrued, unless a higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range. Moreover, even if an
accrual is not required, we provide additional disclosure related to litigation and other claims when it is reasonably possible (

i.e.

, more than remote)
that the outcomes of such litigation and other claims include potential material adverse impacts on us.

10. Fair Value Measurements

FASB literature regarding fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair
value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of "observable inputs" and minimize the use of "unobservable inputs." The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as
follows:

•

Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

•

Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data; and

•

Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of
the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis

The table below segregates all of our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the most
appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to determine the fair value at the measurement date, generally including money market funds, treasury bills,
available-for-sale and derivative financial instruments, and other investments (amounts in millions):

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges

At December 31, 2016, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges.

At
December 31, 2015, the gross notional amount of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges was approximately $489 million. During the year
ended December 31, 2015, we reclassified $8 million of unrealized gains out of "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" and into earnings due to dedesignating $250 million
notional euro to U.S. dollar cash flow hedges when it was determined the hedged transaction would not occur. As a result of the dedesignation, we entered into offsetting foreign currency forward
contracts. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts was $11 million as of December 31, 2015, and recorded in "Other current assets" in our consolidated balance sheet.

For
the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, pre-tax net gains associated with these forward contracts were recorded in "General and administrative expenses" and were
not material.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Hedges ("Cash Flow Hedges")

At December 31, 2016, the gross notional amount of outstanding Cash Flow Hedges was approximately $346 million. The fair value of
these contracts was $22 million of net
unrealized gains with remaining maturities of 12 months or less. Additionally, at December 31, 2016, we had $7 million of net realized but unrecognized gains recorded within
"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" associated with contracts that settled during the year but were deferred and will be amortized into earnings along with the associated hedged revenues.
Such amounts will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.

At
December 31, 2015, the gross notional amount of all outstanding Cash Flow Hedges was approximately $381 million. The fair value of these contracts was $4 million
of net unrealized losses as of December 31, 2015.

During
the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, there was no ineffectiveness relating to our Cash Flow Hedges. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the
amount of pre-tax net realized gains associated with these contracts that were reclassified out of "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" and into earnings was not material.

Fair Value Measurements on a Non-Recurring Basis

We measure the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis, generally annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.

For
the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, there were no impairment charges related to assets that are measured on a non-recurring basis.

11. Debt

Credit Facilities

On October 11, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") for a $2.5 billion secured term loan facility
maturing in October 2020 (the "Original Term Loan"), and a $250 million secured revolving credit facility (the "Original Revolver"). As of December 31, 2015, as a result of repayments
and prepayments during the prior periods, we had $1.9 billion outstanding under the Original Term Loan.

In
conjunction with the King Acquisition, we entered into three amendments to the Credit Agreement (the "Amendments"). The Amendments, among other things, provided for an incremental
tranche of term loans "A" in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.3 billion. The proceeds were provided on February 23, 2016 and were used to fund the King Acquisition. On
March 31, 2016, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Credit Agreement which provided for an incremental tranche of term loans "A" in the aggregate principal amount of $250 million
(together with the $2.3 billion tranche of term loans "A", the "Original TLA"); the proceeds from the incremental borrowing were used to make a voluntary prepayment on our Original Term Loan on
March 31, 2016. In addition to this prepayment, we made voluntary prepayments on our Original Term Loan of $500 million and $800 million on February 25 and May 26,
2016, respectively.

11. Debt (Continued)

On
August 23, 2016 we entered into a fifth amendment to the Credit Agreement (the "Fifth Amendment") that provided for a new tranche of term loans "A" of approximately
$2.9 billion (the "2016 TLA") and an amended revolving credit facility of $250 million (the "Revolver" and together with the 2016 TLA, the "Credit Facilities"). The proceeds from the
2016 TLA were primarily used to pay off the remaining outstanding principal balance on the Original Term Loan of $319 million and the Original TLA of $2.5 billion. As a result of the
payments to extinguish the Original Term Loan and Original TLA, we wrote-off unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of $10 million, which is included in "Loss on extinguishment of
debt" in the consolidated statements of operations. The remaining unamortized discount and deferred financing costs were deferred, along with new fees paid to the 2016 TLA lenders, and will continue
to be amortized over the maturity of the 2016 TLA. As a result of the Fifth Amendment, both the 2016 TLA and the Revolver became unsecured loans. As described below, the 2016 TLA was fully prepaid in
February 2017. The Revolver is scheduled to nature on August 23, 2021. Debt discounts and deferred financing costs incurred in relation to the Fifth Amendment were not material.

Borrowings
under the Revolver may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed by the Company, and are available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Up to
$50 million of the Revolver may be used for letters of credit. To date, we have not drawn on the Revolver. Borrowings under the 2016 TLA and the Revolver will bear interest, at the Company's
option, at either (a) a base rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate, plus 0.5%, (ii) the prime commercial lending rate of Bank of America, N.A. and
(iii) the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") for an interest period of one month beginning on such day plus 1.00%, or (b) LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable interest margin.
LIBOR will be subject to a floor of 0% and the base rate will be subject to an effective floor of 1.00%. The applicable interest margin for borrowings under the 2016 TLA and Revolver will range from
1.125% to 2.00% for LIBOR borrowings and from 0.125% to 1.00% for base rate borrowings and will be determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the Company's credit ratings. At
December 31, 2016, the 2016 TLA bore interest at 2.02%.

The
Credit Agreement requires quarterly principal payments of 0.625% of the stated principal amount of the 2016 TLA commencing on September 30, 2016, with increases to 1.250%
starting on September 30, 2019 and 3.125% starting on September 30, 2020, with the remaining balance payable on the 2016 TLA's scheduled maturity date of August 23, 2021. On
September 30, 2016, in addition to the required quarterly repayment of $18 million, we made a voluntary prepayment on our 2016 TLA of $167 million. These payments satisfied the
required quarterly principal repayments through December 31, 2018.

The
Company is subject to a financial covenant requiring the Company's Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not to exceed (i) 4.00:1.00 on or
prior to March 31, 2017, and (ii) thereafter, 3.50:1.00. The Fifth Amendment contains other covenants that are customary for issuers with similar credit ratings. A violation of any of
these covenants could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, payment of any outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement may be
accelerated, and the lenders' commitments to extend credit under the Credit Agreement may be terminated. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement could, under certain circumstances,
permit the holders of other outstanding unsecured debt, including the debt holders described below, to accelerate the repayment of such obligations. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the
Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2016.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

11. Debt (Continued)

As
of December 31, 2016, the Credit Facilities were guaranteed by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries, whose assets represented approximately 67% of our consolidated assets.

On
February 3, 2017, we entered into a sixth amendment to our Credit Agreement. The amendment (i) provided for a new tranche of term loans "A" in an aggregate principal
amount of $2.55 billion (the "2017 TLA") and (ii) released each of our subsidiary guarantors from their respective guarantee provided under the Credit Agreement. All proceeds of the 2017
TLA, together with additional cash funds on hand, were used to fully prepay the 2016 TLA outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the effectiveness of the sixth amendment, together
with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The terms of the 2017 TLA, other than the absence of guarantees, are generally the same as the terms of the 2016 TLA.

On
February 2, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized repayments of up to $500 million of the company's outstanding debt during 2017. During February 2017, we made
voluntary prepayments on our term loans of $500 million, inclusive of $139 million used to fully prepay the 2016 TLA as discussed above. The voluntary prepayment satisfied the remaining
required quarterly principal repayments for the entire term of the Credit Agreement.

Unsecured Senior Notes

On September 19, 2013, we issued, at par, $1.5 billion of 5.625% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the "Original 2021
Notes") and $750 million of 6.125% unsecured senior notes due September 2023 (the "2023 Notes" and, together with the Original 2021 Notes, the "Notes") in a private offering to qualified
institutional buyers made in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").

The
Original 2021 Notes became eligible for redemption on September 15, 2016 (and, as described below, were redeemed on October 19, 2016). We may redeem the 2023 Notes on
or after September 15, 2018, in whole or in part on any one or more occasions, at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of the
2023 Notes prior to September 15, 2018, at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus a "make-whole premium" and accrued and unpaid interest. Further, upon the
occurrence of one or more qualified
equity offerings, we may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes outstanding with the net cash proceeds from such offerings.

On
September 19, 2016, we issued $650 million of 2.3% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the "New 2021 Notes") and $850 million of 3.4% unsecured senior
notes due September 2026 (the "2026 Notes" and, together with the New 2021 Notes, the "New Notes") in a private offering made in accordance with Rule 144A and Regulation S under the
Securities Act.

In
connection with the issuance of the New Notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors, and
the representatives of the initial purchasers of the New Notes. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to within one year of the issue date of
the New Notes, among other things, (1) file a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange each series of the New Notes for new notes that are substantially identical in
all material respects, (except for the provisions relating to the transfer restrictions and payment of additional interest) and (2) cause the registration statement to be declared effective by
the SEC under the Securities Act.

ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

11. Debt (Continued)

We
may redeem some or all of the New 2021 Notes prior to August 15, 2021 and some or all of the 2026 Notes prior to June 15, 2026, in each case at a price equal to 100% of
the aggregate principal amount thereof plus a "make-whole" premium and accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem the New 2021 Notes on or after August 15, 2021, and the 2026 Notes
on or after June 15, 2026, in each case in whole or in part on any one or more occasions and at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Upon
the occurrence of certain change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase the 2023 Notes and New Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. These repurchase requirements are considered clearly and closely related to the 2023 Notes and New Notes and are not accounted for separately upon issuance.

The
2023 Notes and New Notes are general senior obligations of the Company and rank

pari passu

in right of payment to all of the Company's
existing and future senior indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities described above. As of December 31, 2016, the 2023 Notes and New Notes were guaranteed on a senior basis by certain of our U.S.
subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the indentures underlying the 2023 Notes and New Notes, the guarantees by certain subsidiaries were automatically released when the 2017 TLA guarantees were
removed in connection with the sixth amendment to the Credit Agreement. The 2023 Notes and New Notes are not secured and are effectively subordinated to any of the Company's existing and future
indebtedness that is secured.

On
October 19, 2016, we redeemed the Original 2021 Notes in full for $1.6 billion, which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of approximately $82 million, comprised
of a premium payment of $63 million and write off of unamortized discount and financing costs of $19 million. This loss is included in "Loss on extinguishment of debt" in the
consolidated statements of operations.

The
2023 Notes contain customary covenants that place restrictions in certain circumstances on, among other things, the incurrence of debt, granting of liens, payment of dividends, sales
of assets, and certain merger and consolidation transactions. The New Notes contain customary covenants that place restrictions in certain circumstances on, among other things, the incurrence of
secured debt, entry into sale or leaseback transactions, and certain merger or consolidation transactions. The Company was in compliance with the terms of the 2023 Notes and the New Notes as of
December 31, 2016.

Interest
on the 2023 Notes and New Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, and is recorded within "Accrued expenses and other
liabilities" in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2016, we had interest payable of $13 million and $12 million, related to the 2023 Notes and New Notes,
respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had interest payable of $38 million related to the Notes.

Interest expense and financing costs

Fees and discounts associated with the closing of our debt instruments are recorded as debt discount, which reduces their respective carrying
values, and is amortized over their respective terms. Amortization expense is recorded within "Interest and other expense (income), net" in our consolidated statements of operations.

In
connection with the debt financing for the Original TLA and New Notes offering, we incurred $38 million and $17 million of discounts and financing costs, respectively,
that were capitalized and

F-31


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

11. Debt (Continued)

recorded
within "Long-term debt, net" in our consolidated balance sheet. New lender fees and deferred financing costs related to the 2016 TLA were not material.

For
the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014: interest expense was $197 million, $193 million, and $201 million, respectively; amortization of the
debt discount and deferred financing costs was $20 million, $7 million, and $7 million, respectively; and commitment fees for the Revolver were not material.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying values of the 2016 TLA and the Original Term Loan approximate their fair value, based on Level 2 inputs (observable market
prices in less than active markets), as the interest rate is variable over the selected interest period and is similar to current rates at which we can borrow funds. Based on Level 2 inputs,
the fair values of the 2023 Notes, New 2021 Notes, and 2026 Notes were $818 million, $635 million, and $808 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. Based on
Level 2 inputs, the fair values of the Original 2021 Notes and 2023 Notes were $1,571 million and $795 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015.

13. Operating Segments and Geographic Region

Currently, we have three reportable operating segments. Our operating segments are consistent with the manner in which our operations are reviewed and managed by our Chief Executive
Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of: the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect
to certain of our online-enabled games; share-based compensation expense; amortization of intangible

F-33

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

13. Operating Segments and Geographic Region (Continued)

assets
as a result of purchase price accounting; and fees and other expenses (including legal fees, expenses and accruals) related to acquisitions, associated integration activities, and financings.
The CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis, and accordingly, no disclosure is made with respect thereto.

Our
operating segments are also consistent with our internal organization structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the availability of separate
financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments.

Information
on the operating segments and reconciliations of total segment net revenues and total segment operating income to consolidated net revenues from external customers and
consolidated income before income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are presented below (amounts in millions):

14. Share-Based Payments

Activision Blizzard Equity Incentive Plans

On June 5, 2014, our shareholders approved the Activision Blizzard, Inc. 2014 Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan") and the 2014 Plan
became effective. The 2014 Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors to provide share-based compensation in the form of stock options, share appreciation rights, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and other performance- or value-based awards structured by the Compensation Committee within parameters set forth in the 2014 Plan.

While
the Compensation Committee has broad discretion to create equity incentives, our share-based compensation program for the most part currently utilizes a combination of options and
restricted stock units. The majority of our options have time-based vesting schedules, generally vesting annually over a period of three to five years, and expire ten years from the grant date.
Restricted stock units either have time-based vesting schedules, generally vesting in their entirety on an anniversary of the date of grant, or vest annually over a period of three to five years, or
vest only if certain performance measures are met. In addition, under the terms of the 2014 Plan, the exercise price for the options must be equal to or greater than the closing price per share of our
common stock on the date the award is granted, as reported on NASDAQ.

14. Share-Based Payments (Continued)

Upon
the effective date of the 2014 Plan, we ceased making awards under our prior equity incentive plans (collectively, the "Prior Plans"), although such plans will remain in effect and
continue to govern outstanding awards. Additionally, in connection with the King Acquisition, a majority of the outstanding options and awards with respect to King shares that were unvested as of the
King Closing Date were converted into equivalent options and awards with respect to shares of the Company's common stock (see Note 21 for further discussion). As part of the conversion, we
assumed King's equity incentive plan (the "King Plan") and amended the King Plan to convert it to a plan with respect to shares of the Company's common stock for the King shares assumed. No future
shares can be granted from King Plan.

As
of the date it was approved by our shareholders, there were 46 million shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. The number of shares of our common stock reserved for
issuance under the 2014 Plan has been, and may be further, increased from time to time by: (i) the number of shares relating to awards outstanding under any Prior Plan that: (a) expire,
or are forfeited, terminated or canceled, without the issuance of shares; (b) are settled in cash in lieu of shares; or (c) are exchanged, prior to the issuance of shares of our common
stock, for awards not involving our common stock; (ii) if the exercise price of any option outstanding under any Prior Plans is, or the tax withholding requirements with respect to any award
outstanding under any Prior Plans are, satisfied by withholding shares otherwise then deliverable in respect of the award or the actual or constructive transfer to the Company of shares already owned,
the number of shares equal to the withheld or transferred shares; and (iii) if a share appreciation right is exercised and settled in shares, a number of shares equal to the difference between
the total number of shares with respect to which the award is exercised and the number of shares actually issued or transferred. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 34 million
shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Shares issued in connection with awards made under the 2014 Plan are generally issued as new stock issuances.

Fair Value Valuation Assumptions

Valuation of Stock Options

We use a binomial-lattice model to value our stock options. We estimate expected future changes in model inputs during an option's contractual
term. The inputs required by our binomial-lattice model include expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, contractual term, and vesting schedule, as well as measures of employees'
cancellations, exercise, and post-vesting termination behavior. Statistical methods were used to estimate employee rank-specific termination rates. These termination rates, in turn, were used to model
the number of options that are expected to
vest and post-vesting termination behavior. Employee rank-specific estimates of expected time-to-exercise ("ETTE") were used to reflect employee exercise behavior. ETTE was estimated by using
statistical procedures to first estimate the probability of exercise occurring during each time period, conditional on the option surviving to that time period, and then using those probabilities to
determine the ETTE. The model was calibrated by adjusting parameters controlling exercise and post-vesting termination behavior so that the measures output by the model matched values of these
measures that were estimated from historical data.

Expected life

The
expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is an output from the
binomial-lattice model. The expected life of employee stock options depends on all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. A binomial-lattice model can be viewed as assuming that
employees will exercise their options when the stock price equals or exceeds an exercise multiple, of which the multiple is based on historical employee exercise behaviors.

Risk-free interest rate

As
is the case for volatility, the risk-free interest rate is assumed to change during the option's contractual term. Consistent with the calculation required by a
binomial-lattice model, the risk-free interest rate reflects the expected movement in the interest rate from one time period to the next ("forward rate"), as opposed to the interest rate from the
grant date to the given time period ("spot rate").

Volatility

To
estimate volatility for the binomial-lattice model, we use methods that consider the implied volatility based upon the volatilities for exchange-traded options on
our stock to estimate short-term volatility, the historical volatility of our common shares during the option's contractual term to estimate long-term volatility, and a statistical model to estimate
the transition or "mean reversion" from short-term volatility to long-term volatility.

Dividend yield

The
expected dividend yield assumption for options granted during the year ended December 31, 2016 is based on our historical and expected future amount of
dividend payouts.

14. Share-Based Payments (Continued)

As
share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 is based on awards ultimately
expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

Valuation of Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs")

The fair value of the Company's RSU awards granted is based upon the closing price of the Company's stock price on the date of grant reduced by
the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting.

Accuracy of Fair Value Estimates

We developed the assumptions used in the models above, including model inputs and measures of employees' exercise and post-vesting termination
behavior. Our ability to accurately estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards at the grant date depends upon the accuracy of the model and our ability to accurately forecast model inputs
as long as 10 years into the future. These inputs include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility, risk-free rate, dividend yield, and employee termination rates. Although the
fair value of employee stock options is determined using an option-pricing model, the estimates that are produced by this model may not be indicative of the fair
value observed between a willing buyer and a willing seller. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine if this is the case, as markets do not currently exist that permit the active trading of
employee stock option and other share-based instruments.

For options assumed in the King Acquisition, 0.7 million of the options are based on performance conditions which do not have an accounting grant date as of December 31,
2016, as there is not a mutual understanding between the Company and the employee of the performance terms.

The
aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i.e. the difference between our closing stock price on the last trading day of the
period and the exercise price, times the number of shares for options where the closing stock price is greater than the exercise price)
that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on that date. This amount changes based on the market value of our stock. The total intrinsic value
of options actually exercised was $161 million, $125 million, and $117 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The total grant date
fair value of options vested was $40 million, $19 million, and $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

At
December 31, 2016, $88 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.73 years.

RSU Activity

We grant RSUs, which represent the right to receive shares of our common stock. Vesting for RSUs is contingent upon the holders' continued
employment with us and may be subject to other conditions (which may include the satisfaction of a performance measure). Also, certain of our performance-based RSUs include a range of shares that may
be released at vesting which are above or below the targeted number of RSUs based on actual performance relative to the grant date performance measure. If the vesting conditions are not met, unvested
RSUs will be forfeited. Upon vesting of the RSUs, we may withhold shares otherwise deliverable to satisfy tax withholding requirements.

The
following table summarizes our RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2016, with performance-based RSUs presented at the maximum potential shares that could be earned
and issued at vesting (amounts in thousands except per share amounts):

Certain
of our performance-based RSUs did not have an accounting grant date as of December 31, 2016, as there is not a mutual understanding between the Company and the employee of
the performance terms. Generally, these performance terms relate to revenue and operating income performance for future years where the performance goals have not yet been set. As of
December 31, 2016, there were 5.1 million performance-based RSUs outstanding for which the accounting grant date

has
not been set, of which 3.6 million were 2016 grants. Accordingly, no grant date fair value was established and the weighted average grant date fair value calculated above for 2016 grants
excludes these RSUs.

At
December 31, 2016, approximately $89 million of total unrecognized compensation cost was related to RSUs and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
of 1.65 years. Of the total unrecognized compensation cost, $56 million was related to performance-based RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.85 years. The total grant date fair value of vested RSUs was $123 million, $93 million and $92 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.

The
income tax benefit from stock option exercises and RSUs was $134 million, $109 million, and $89 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and
2014, respectively.

15. Income Taxes (Continued)

For
the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, income tax benefits attributable to equity-based compensation transactions exceeded the amounts recorded based on grant date
fair value. During the third quarter of 2016, we early adopted an accounting standard which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments. The standard, among other things, requires all excess
tax benefits and tax deficiencies be recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the statement of operations (see Note 22). As a result, $81 million was recognized as a reduction to
income tax expense in 2016. Conversely, in 2015 and 2014, $65 million and $30 million, respectively, were credited to shareholders' equity.

The
items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the income tax expense (benefit) at the effective tax rate for
each of the years are as follows (amounts in millions):

The
Company's tax rate is affected by the tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the relative amount of income earned by jurisdiction, and the jurisdictions with a
statutory tax rate less than the U.S. rate of 35%.

In
2013, in connection with the Purchase Transaction, we assumed certain tax attributes, generally consisting of net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards of approximately
$760 million, which represent a potential tax benefit of approximately $266 million. The utilization of such NOL carryforwards will be subject to certain annual limitations and will
begin to expire in 2021. The Company also obtained indemnification from Vivendi against losses attributable to the disallowance of claimed utilization of such NOL carryforwards of up to
$200 million in unrealized tax benefits in the aggregate, limited to taxable years ending on or prior to December 31, 2016. No benefit for these tax attributes or indemnification was
recorded upon the close of the Purchase Transaction. As of December 31, 2016, we had utilized approximately $657 million of the original NOL and had recorded an indemnification asset of
$200 million in "Other assets." Correspondingly, the same amount was recorded as a reduction to the consideration paid for the shares repurchased in "Treasury stock." In each of the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2015, we utilized $326 million and $180 million of the NOL and recognized a corresponding reserve of $114 million and $63 million in each of
those years ended, respectively.

As
of December 31, 2016, we had gross tax credit carryforwards of $240 million and $137 million for federal and state purposes, respectively, which begin to expire
in fiscal 2025. The tax credit carryforwards are presented in "Deferred tax assets" net of unrealized tax benefits that would apply upon the realization of uncertain tax positions. In addition, we had
state NOL carryforwards of $9 million which begin to expire in fiscal 2027. Through our foreign operations, we had approximately $6 million in NOL carryforwards at December 31,
2016, attributed mainly to losses in France which can be carried forward indefinitely.

We
evaluate our deferred tax assets, including net operating losses and tax credits, to determine if a valuation allowance is required. We assess whether a valuation allowance should be
established or released based on the consideration of all available evidence using a "more-likely-than-not" standard. Realization of the U.S. deferred tax assets is dependent upon the continued
generation of sufficient taxable income. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Although realization is not assured, management believes it
is more likely than not

F-44


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

15. Income Taxes (Continued)

that
the net carrying value of the U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, there are no valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.

Cumulative
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided approximated $5,127 million at December 31, 2016. Deferred income
taxes on these earnings have not been provided as these amounts are considered to be permanent in duration. Determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings is
not practicable because of the complexity of the hypothetical calculation. In the event of a distribution of these earnings to the U.S. in the form of a dividend, we may be subject to both foreign
withholding taxes and U.S. income taxes net of allowable foreign tax credits.

Activision
Blizzard's tax years 2009 through 2015 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject. The IRS is currently examining the Company's
federal tax returns for the 2009 through 2011 tax years. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company transitioned the review of its transfer pricing methodology from the advanced pricing agreement
review process to the IRS examination team. Their review could result in a different allocation of profits and losses under the Company's transfer pricing agreements. Such allocation could have a
positive or negative impact on our provision for the period in which such a determination is reached and the relevant periods thereafter. The Company also has several state and non-U.S. audits
pending. In addition, as part of purchase price accounting for the King Acquisition, the Company assumed $74 million of uncertain tax positions primarily related to the transfer pricing on King
tax years occurring prior to the King Acquisition. The Company is currently in negotiations with the relevant jurisdictions and taxing authorities with respect to King's transfer pricing, which could
result in a different allocation of profits and losses between the relevant jurisdictions.

Vivendi
Games' results for the period from January 1, 2008 through July 9, 2008 are included in the consolidated federal and certain foreign, state and local income tax
returns filed by Vivendi or its affiliates, while Vivendi Games' results for the period from July 10, 2008 through December 31, 2008 are included in the consolidated federal and certain
foreign, state and local income tax returns filed by Activision Blizzard. IRS Appeals proceedings concerning Vivendi Games' tax return for the 2008 tax year were concluded during July 2016 but that
year remains open to examination by other major taxing authorities. The resolution of the 2008 IRS Appeals process did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Certain
of our subsidiaries are under examination or investigation or may be subject to examination or investigation by tax authorities in various jurisdictions, including France. These
proceedings may lead to adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or provisions for uncertain tax positions. Such proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated
financial position, liquidity or results of operations in the period or periods in which the matters are resolved or in which appropriate tax provisions are taken into account in our financial
statements. If we were to receive a materially adverse assessment from a taxing jurisdiction, we would plan to vigorously contest it and consider all of our options, including the pursuit of judicial
remedies.

As
of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $846 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $812 million would affect our effective tax rate, if
recognized. A reconciliation of total gross

We
recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in "Income tax expense". As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had approximately $71 million and
$41 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recorded $17 million,
$10 million, and $5 million, respectively, of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions.

The
final resolution of the Company's global tax disputes is uncertain. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of disputes, including the probability determination and
estimation of the potential exposure. Based on current information, in the opinion of the Company's management, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations, except as noted above.

Certain
of our unvested restricted stock rights (including certain restricted stock units and performance shares) met the definition of participating securities as they participate in
earnings based on their rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Therefore, we are required to use the two-class method in our computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share. For the
years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, on a weighted-average basis, we had outstanding unvested restricted stock rights with respect to 3 million, 8 million, and
15 million shares of common stock, respectively, that are participating in earnings.

Certain
of our employee-related restricted stock rights and stock options are contingently issuable upon the satisfaction of pre-defined performance measures. These shares are included
in the weighted-average dilutive common shares only if the performance measures are met as of the end of the reporting period. Approximately 8 million, 3 million, and 4 million
shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2016, respectively, as their respective performance measures have not
been met.

Potential
common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per common share calculation when the inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a
period in which a net loss is recorded. Therefore, options to acquire 5 million, 1 million, and 2 million shares of common stock were not included in the calculation of diluted
earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

Dividends

On February 2, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share. Such dividend is payable on
May 10, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2017.

On
February 2, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per common share. Such dividend was payable on May 11, 2016, to shareholders of record at the

dividend equivalent payments of $3 million to certain holders of restricted stock rights.

On
February 6, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per common share. Such dividend was payable on May 14, 2014, to shareholders of record at the

19. Commitments and Contingencies

Letters of Credit

As described in Note 11, a portion of our Revolver can be used to issue letters of credit of up to $50 million, subject to the
availability of the Revolver. At December 31, 2016, we did not have any letters of credit issued or outstanding under the Revolver.

Commitments

In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for non-cancelable operating lease agreements for
our offices, for the development of products and for the rights to intellectual property. Under these agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor, developer or intellectual
property holder, as the case may be, based upon contractual arrangements. The payments to third-party developers are generally conditioned upon the achievement by the developers of contractually
specified development milestones. Further, these payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders typically are deemed to be advances and, as such, are recoupable against future
royalties earned by the developer or intellectual property holder based on sales of the related game. Additionally, in connection with certain intellectual property rights, acquisitions and
development agreements, we commit to spend specified amounts for marketing support for the game(s) which is (are) to be developed or in which the intellectual property will be utilized. Assuming all
contractual provisions are met, the total future minimum commitments
for these and other contractual arrangements in place at December 31, 2016 are scheduled to be paid as follows (amounts in millions):

We
have omitted uncertain income tax liabilities from this table due to the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of the potential issue resolution of the
underlying matters. Specifically, either (a) the underlying positions have not been fully developed under audit to quantify at this time or, (b) the years relating to the matters for
certain jurisdictions are not currently under audit. At December 31, 2016, we had $587 million of net unrecognized tax benefits included in "Other liabilities" in our consolidated
balance sheet.

Long-term
debt obligations represent our obligations related to the contractual principal repayments and interest payments under the 2016 TLA, 2023 Notes, and the
New Notes as of December 31, 2016. There was no outstanding balance under our Revolver as of December 31, 2016. The 2023 Notes and the New Notes are subject to fixed interest rates and
we have calculated the interest obligation based on the applicable rates and payment dates. The 2016 TLA bears a variable interest rate and interest is payable on a monthly basis. We have calculated
the expected interest obligation based on the outstanding principal balance and interest rate applicable at December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on our debt
obligations.

Legal Proceedings

We are party to routine claims, suits, investigations, audits, and other proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business, including
with respect to intellectual property rights, contractual claims, labor and employment matters, regulatory matters, tax matters, unclaimed property matters, compliance matters, and collection matters.
In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, such routine claims and lawsuits are not significant and we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Purchase Transaction Matters

In prior periods, the Company reported on litigation related to the Purchase Transaction. During the period ended June 30, 2015, the
cases were resolved and dismissed with prejudice. As part of the resolution of the claims, we received a settlement payment of $202 million in July 2015 from Vivendi, ASAC LP, and our
insurers. We recorded the settlement within "Shareholders' equity" in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

20. Related Party Transactions

Transactions with Vivendi and Its Affiliates

As part of the Business Combination in 2008, we entered into various transactions and agreements, including cash management services agreements,
a tax sharing agreement and an investor agreement, with Vivendi and its subsidiaries. In connection with the consummation of the Purchase Transaction, we terminated the cash management arrangements
with Vivendi and amended our investor agreement with Vivendi. We are also party to a number of agreements with subsidiaries and other affiliates of Vivendi, including music licensing and distribution
arrangements and promotional arrangements, none of which were impacted by the Purchase Transaction. None of these services, transactions, and agreements with Vivendi and its affiliates were material,
either individually or in the aggregate, to the consolidated financial statements as a whole.

On
May 28, 2014, Vivendi sold 41 million shares, reducing its ownership interest below 10%, and was no longer considered a related party as of December 31, 2015.
Subsequent to December 31, 2015, Vivendi sold its remaining shares of our common stock.

Transactions with ASAC's Affiliates

In connection with the Purchase Transaction, on October 11, 2013, we, ASAC LP and, for the limited purposes set forth therein,
Messrs. Kotick and Kelly entered into a stockholders agreement (the "Stockholders Agreement"). The Stockholders Agreement contains various agreements among the parties regarding voting rights,
transfer rights, and a standstill agreement, among other things. In connection with the settlement of the litigation related to the Purchase Transaction, the parties to the Stockholders Agreement
amended that agreement on May 28, 2015.

As
of December 31, 2015, ASAC LP, held approximately 172 million shares, or approximately 23% of the outstanding shares of our common stock at that time. Robert A.
Kotick, our Chief Executive Officer, and Brian G. Kelly, Chairman of our Board of Directors, are the managers of ASAC II GP. On June 8, 2016, ASAC GP distributed the approximately
141 million shares allocable to the limited partners of ASAC LP to those limited partners. On July 7, 2016, ASAC LP distributed approximately

18 million
of its remaining approximately 31 million shares to ASAC GP. On August 15, 2016, ASAC GP sold approximately 4 million shares of our common stock
and distributed 14 million shares pro rata to its members, consisting of trusts for the benefit of Messrs. Kotick and Kelly, which shares were ultimately sold on that day for financial
and estate-planning purposes. On August 19, 2016, ASAC LP distributed its remaining shares of common stock to ASAC GP, leaving ASAC LP without any shares and ASAC GP
with approximately 13 million shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 2% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2016. On February 10,
2017, ASAC GP distributed its remaining shares. We did not receive any proceeds from any of the distributions or sales of the shares.

21. Acquisitions

King Digital Entertainment

On February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition, purchasing all of its outstanding shares. As a result, King became a wholly
owned subsidiary of Activision Blizzard. King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly on mobile platforms, such as Android and iOS,
and on online and social platforms, such as Facebook and the king.com websites. King's results of operations since the King Closing Date are included in our consolidated financial statements.

We
made this acquisition because we believe that the addition of King's highly-complementary mobile business positions the Company as a global leader in interactive entertainment across
console, PC, and mobile platforms, as well as positioning us for future growth.

The
aggregate purchase price of the King Acquisition was approximately $5.8 billion, which was paid on the King Closing Date and funded primarily with $3.6 billion of
existing cash and $2.2 billion of cash from new debt issued by the Company. The total aggregate purchase price for King was comprised of (amounts in millions):

ranging from approximately 0.1 years to 7.6 years, and (d) an expected dividend yield of 0.9%. See additional discussion under Share-Based Compensation below.

We
identified and recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values at the King Closing Date, and allocated the remaining value of approximately
$2.7 billion to goodwill. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded certain immaterial measurement period adjustments to our preliminary purchase price allocation based on
additional analysis of facts and circumstances that existed as of the King Closing Date.

During
the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $38 million of expenses related to the King Acquisition, which are included within "General and
administrative" in the consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the debt financing that occurred on the King Closing Date, we incurred $38 million of issuance costs that were
capitalized and recorded within "Long-term debt, net" on our consolidated balance sheet. The amortization of these capitalized costs was not material to our consolidated statement of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2016.

Share-Based Compensation

In connection with the King Acquisition, a majority of the outstanding King options and awards that were unvested as of the King Closing Date
were converted into equivalent options and awards with respect to shares of the Company's common stock, using an equity award exchange ratio calculated in accordance with the transaction agreement. As
a result, replacement equity options and awards of 10 million and 3 million, respectively, were issued. The portion of the fair value related to

F-52


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

21. Acquisitions (Continued)

pre-combination
services of $76 million was included in the purchase price, while the remaining fair value will be recognized over the remaining service periods. As of December 31, 2016,
the future expense for the converted King options and awards was approximately $40 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average service period of approximately 1.6 years.

The
remaining portion of outstanding unvested awards that were assumed were replaced with deferred cash awards. The cash proceeds were placed in an escrow-like account with the cash
releases to occur based on the awards' original vesting schedule upon future service being rendered. The cash associated with these awards is recorded in "Other current assets" and "Other assets" in
our consolidated balance sheet. The portion of the fair value related to pre-combination services of $22 million was included in the purchase price while the remaining fair value of
approximately $9 million will be recognized over
the remaining service periods. A portion of the cash proceeds placed in an escrow-like account were released to award holders over the course of 2016, but the amount was not material.

Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired and Goodwill

The fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired from King were estimated using an income approach, with the exception of the
customer base, which was estimated using a cost approach. The fair value of the intangibles using the income approach was determined with the following key assumptions: (a) a weighted average
cost of capital of 13%, (b) long-term revenue decay rates ranging from 0% to 65%, and (c) royalty rates ranging from 0.5% to 8%. The fair value of the intangibles using the cost approach
was based on amounts that would be required to replace the asset (

i.e.,

replacement cost).

The
Internally-developed franchises, Customer base, Developed software, and Trade name intangible assets will be amortized to "Cost of revenues—subscription, licensing, and
other revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses," "Sales and marketing," "Cost of revenues—subscription, licensing, and other
revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses," and "General and administrative," respectively. The intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated
useful lives in proportion to the economic benefits received.

The
$2.7 billion of goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to the benefits the Company expects to derive from accelerated expansion as an interactive entertainment provider
in the mobile sector, future franchises, and technology, as well as the management team's proven ability to create future games and franchises. Approximately $620 million of the goodwill is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes in the U.S.

Contingent Liabilities Assumed

As a result of the King Acquisition, we assumed contingent liabilities related to contingent consideration associated with King's previous
acquisitions of Nonstop Games Oy and Z2Live, Inc. The remaining contingent consideration for Non Stop Games Oy is linked to amounts generated from games launched by Nonstop Games Oy over a
specified period. The range of the potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Company could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement is from $0 to
$84 million. The remaining contingent
consideration for Z2Live, Inc. is linked to amounts generated from specific games launched by Z2Live, Inc. within a defined period. The potential range of undiscounted future payments
that the

F-53


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement is from $0 to $75 million. The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement at the King Closing date
and as of December 31, 2016, for Nonstop Games Oy and Z2Live, Inc. was immaterial.

from acquired intangible assets, employee compensation from replacement equity awards issued in the King Acquisition and the profit sharing bonus plan established as part of the King Acquisition, and
interest expense from the new debt incurred in connection with the King Acquisition, among other adjustments. We also adjusted for Activision Blizzard and King non-recurring acquisition-related costs
of approximately $74 million incurred for the year ended December 31, 2016. The unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2015 were adjusted to
include these charges.

The
unaudited pro forma financial information as presented below is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been

22. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements

Share-based compensation

In June 2014, the FASB issued new guidance related to share-based compensation. The new standard requires that a performance target that affects
vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair
value of the award. This update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should
represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered. We adopted this new standard as of January 1, 2016, and applied it
prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Consolidations

In February 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to consolidations. The new standard amends certain requirements for determining whether a
variable interest entity must be consolidated. We adopted this new standard as of January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

Debt Issuance Costs

In April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. The new standard
requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as
interest expense. We adopted this change in accounting
principle as of January 1, 2016, and applied it retrospectively for each period presented. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Internal-Use Software

In April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to internal-use software. The new standard relates to a customer's accounting for fees paid
in cloud computing arrangements. The amendment provides guidance for customers to determine whether such arrangements include software licenses. If a cloud arrangement includes a software license,
then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a
software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2016, and applied it prospectively. The adoption of this
guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Business Combinations

In September 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to business combinations. The new standard requires that the cumulative impact of a
measurement period adjustment, including the impact on prior periods, on provisional amounts recorded at the acquisition date as a result of the business combination be recognized in the reporting
period the adjustment is identified. The standard also

F-55


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

22. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements (Continued)

requires
separate presentation on the face of the income statement, or disclosure in the notes, of the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item. Prior to the issuance of
the standard, such adjustments to provisional amounts were recognized retrospectively. We adopted this new standard as of January 1, 2016, and applied it prospectively. No measurement period
adjustments impacting earnings occurred as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Share-Based Payments

In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify accounting for share-based payments. The new standard, amongst other
things:

•

requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statement of
operations and that the tax effects of exercised or vested awards be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur;

•

requires excess tax benefits from share-based payments to be reported as operating activities on the statement of cash flows; and

•

permits an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate, as
currently required, or account for forfeitures when they occur.

We
elected to early adopt this new standard in the third quarter of 2016, which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of January 1, 2016. As part of the adoption, we made
certain elections, including the following:

•

to apply the presentation requirements for our consolidated statement of cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all
periods presented; and

•

to continue to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate.

As
a result of the adoption, we recognized excess tax benefits of $81 million as a reduction to income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2016. Further, given our retrospective application of the presentation requirements for our consolidated statement of cash flows related to excess tax benefits, our net cash
provided by operating activities and net cash used in financing activities increased by $67 million and $39 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, and December 31,
2014, respectively. The other provisions of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows

In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of certain cash items in the statement of cash flows. The new
standard requires, among other things, that cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities, as opposed to operating
activities as is required under existing guidance. We elected to early adopt this standard in the third quarter of 2016 and applied it retrospectively. As a result of the adoption of this standard,
our cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the $63 million premium payment from the October 19, 2016 redemption of our Original

Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted

Revenue recognition

In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP
guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance, providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize
revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This
guidance will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017, and can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a
cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are evaluating the adoption method as well as the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements and related
disclosures. As previously disclosed, we believe the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard may have a significant impact on the accounting for our sales of our games with significant online
functionality for which we do not have VSOE for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided. Under the current accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements is required. This
requirement will be eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly, we may be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software, as compared to the current
requirement of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated offering period. This potential difference may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption
of this new guidance. As accounting implementation guidance and clarifications regarding this matter is still evolving, we continue to evaluate the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP
guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease and lessees will need to recognize a lease liability and a
right-of-use asset for their leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease
incentives received and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will be
based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of
the earliest comparative period presented. We are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

Inventory

In July 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to the measurement of inventory which requires inventory within the scope of the guidance to
be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of
completion, disposal, and transportation. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The
impact this new standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Financial Instruments

In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The new
standard, amongst other things, generally requires companies to measure investments in other entities, except those accounted for under the equity method, at fair value and recognize any changes in
fair value in net income. The new standard also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The new standard is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, and the guidance should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The
amendments related to equity investments without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of
adoption. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows—Restricted Cash

In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard
requires that a statement of cash flows
explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the
beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and should be applied
retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted.

We
are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements. We expect there would be a significant impact to the consolidated statements
of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, as those years include, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash as a result of transferring
cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the King Acquisition and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 in connection with the King Acquisition. Under this new standard, the
restricted cash balance would be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and hence would not be included as an investing activity in the
statement of cash flows.

Goodwill

In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance which eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if any entity forgoes a Step 0
test, an entity will be required to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit, as

F-58


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

22. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements (Continued)

determined
in Step 1 from the goodwill impairment test, with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge, if any, for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's
fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and should be applied
prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

During
the third quarter of 2016, we early adopted an accounting standard which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments. The standard, among other things,
requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statement of operations (see Note 22). The adoption of the standard
impacted our previously reported results for the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016. As a result of the adoption of this standard, our net income, basic earnings per share,
and diluted earnings per share increased by $24 million, $0.03, and $0.03, respectively, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, and $27 million, $0.04, and $0.03, respectively, for
