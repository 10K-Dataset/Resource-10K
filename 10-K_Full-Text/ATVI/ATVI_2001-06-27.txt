Item 1. BUSINESS

(a)

General

Activision, Inc.
(together with its subsidiaries, "Activision" or the "Company") is a leading international publisher, developer and distributor of interactive entertainment
and leisure products. The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979. In December 1992, the Company reincorporated in Delaware. In June 2000, the Company reorganized into
a holding company organizational structure as described below.

The
Company's products span a wide range of genres (including action, adventure, extreme sports, racing, strategy and simulation) and target markets (including game enthusiasts, mass
market consumers, value buyers and children). In addition to its genre and market diversity, the Company publishes, develops and distributes products for a variety of game platforms and operating
systems, including personal computers ("PCs"), the Sony PlayStation and PlayStation 2 and Nintendo N64 console systems and the Nintendo Game Boy handheld devices. The Company is also currently
focusing on the development of products for Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCube console systems and Nintendo Game Boy Advance hand held device. During January 2001, Sega Corp., the maker of
the Sega Dreamcast ("Dreamcast") announced that it would stop making the Dreamcast in March 2001. Net revenues from the Dreamcast have historically represented only a small percentage of the
Company's total net revenues. Accordingly, the Company believes that the departure of the Dreamcast console system from the market will not have a material impact upon its financial position or
results of operations.

In
the fourth quarter of the Company's fiscal year ended March 31, 2000, the Company adopted and began the implementation of a strategic restructuring plan. During fiscal 2001,
the Company completed its restructuring initiatives. The plan and its components are described in Item 7â€”"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations."

(b)

Holding Company Organizational Structure

Effective
June 9, 2000, Activision reorganized into a holding company form of organizational structure, whereby Activision Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Activision Holdings"), became the holding company for Activision and its subsidiaries. The new holding company organizational structure will allow Activision to manage its entire organization more
effectively and broadens the alternatives for future financings.

The
holding company organizational structure was effected by a merger conducted pursuant to Section 251 (g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
which provides for the formation of a holding company structure without a vote of the stockholders of the constituent corporations. In the merger, ATVI Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
organized for the purpose of implementing the holding company organizational structure (the "Merger Sub"), merged with and into Activision with Activision as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation"). Prior to the merger, Activision Holdings was a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Activision and Merger Sub was a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Activision Holdings. Pursuant to the
merger, (i) each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Activision (including treasury shares) was converted into one share of common stock of Activision Holdings, (ii) each
issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub was converted into one share of the Surviving Corporation's common stock, and Merger Sub's corporate existence ceased, and (iii) all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Activision Holdings owned by Activision were automatically canceled and retired. As a result of the merger, Activision became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Activision
Holdings.


Immediately following the merger, Activision changed its name to "Activision Publishing, Inc." and Activision Holdings changed its name to "Activision, Inc." The holding
company's common stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq National Market under the symbol ATVI.

The
conversion of shares of Activision's common stock in the merger occurred without an exchange of certificates. Accordingly, certificates formerly representing shares of outstanding
common stock of Activision are deemed to represent the same number of shares of common stock of Activision Holdings. The change to the holding company structure was tax free for federal income tax
purposes for stockholders.

These
transactions had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

(c)

Business Combinations

Over
the years, the Company has consummated a number of acquisitions of both software development companies and software distribution companies. All of the acquisitions detailed
below, with the exception of the acquisitions of Expert Software, Inc. ("Expert") and Elsinore Multimedia, Inc. ("Elsinore"), were accounted for as poolings of interests. The
acquisitions of Expert and Elsinore were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. See the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information regarding these acquisitions.

Software Development Companies

On September 30, 1999, the Company acquired JCM Productions, Inc. dba Neversoft Entertainment ("Neversoft"), a privately held console software
developer in exchange for 698,835 shares of the Company's common stock. On June 29, 1999, the Company acquired Elsinore, a privately held interactive software development company, in exchange
for 204,448 shares of the Company's common stock. On June 22, 1999, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Expert, a publicly held developer and publisher of
value-line interactive software for approximately $24.7 million. On June 30, 1998, the Company acquired S.B.F. Services, Limited dba Head Games Publishing ("Head Games") in
exchange for 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock. On August 26, 1997, the Company acquired Raven Software Corporation ("Raven") in exchange for 1,040,000 shares of the Company's
common stock.

Distribution Companies

On September 29, 1998, the Company acquired CD Contact Data GmbH ("CD Contact) in exchange for 1,900,000 shares of the Company's common stock and the
assumption of $9.1 million in outstanding debt payable to CD Contact's former shareholders. On November 26, 1997, the Company acquired NBG EDV Handels-und Verlags GmbH
("NBG") in exchange for 281,206 shares of the Company's common stock. On November 26, 1997, the Company acquired Combined Distribution (Holdings) Limited ("CentreSoft") in exchange for
2,787,043 shares and 50,325 options to acquire shares of the Company's common stock.

(d)

Financial Information About Industry Segments

The
Company has two reportable segments: publishing CD-based and cartridge based interactive entertainment and leisure software, and distributing interactive entertainment
and leisure products. Publishing relates to the development (both internally and externally), marketing and sale of products owned or controlled by the Company, either directly, by license or through
its affiliate label program with third party publishers. Distribution primarily refers to logistical and sales services provided by the
Company's European distribution subsidiaries of other publishers' software and related products to the marketplace. See the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain financial information required by Item 1.

Narrative Description of Business

Factors Affecting Future Performance

In connection with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Litigation Reform Act"), the Company is hereby disclosing certain cautionary
information to be used in connection with written materials (including this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and oral statements made by or on behalf of its employees and representatives
that may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Litigation Reform Act. Such statements consist of any statement other than a recitation of historical fact and can be identified
by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "may," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate" or "continue" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. The listener or
reader is cautioned that all forward-looking statements are necessarily speculative and there are numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from
those referred to in such forward-looking statements. The discussion below highlights some of the more important risks identified by management, but should not be assumed to be the only factors that
could affect future performance. The reader or listener is cautioned that the Company does not have a policy of updating or revising forward-looking statements and thus he or she should not assume
that silence by management over time means that actual events are bearing out as estimated in such forward-looking statements.

Fluctuations In Quarterly Results; Future Operating Results Uncertain; Seasonality.

The Company's quarterly operating
results have varied significantly in the past and will likely vary significantly in the future depending on numerous factors, several of which are not under the Company's control. Such factors
include, but are not limited to, demand for products published or distributed by the Company, the size and rate of growth of the interactive entertainment and leisure markets, development and
promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new products, changes in operating systems and platforms, product returns, the timing of orders from major customers, delays in shipment, the level
of price competition, the timing of product introductions by the Company and its competitors, product life cycles, product defects and other quality problems, the level of the Company's international
revenues, and personnel changes. Products are generally shipped as orders are received, and consequently, the Company operates with little or no backlog. Net revenues in any quarter are, therefore,
substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter.

The
Company's expenses are based in part on the Company's product development, acquisition and marketing budgets. Many of the costs incurred by the Company to produce and sell its
products are
expensed as such costs are incurred, which often occurs before a product is released. In addition, a significant portion of the Company's expenses are fixed. As the Company increases its production,
acquisition and sales activities, current expenses will increase and, if sales from previously released products are below expectations, net income is likely to be disproportionately affected.

Due
to all of the foregoing, revenues and operating results for any future quarter are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy. Accordingly, the Company believes that
period-to-period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.

The
Company's business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant seasonality, in part due to consumer buying patterns. Net revenues typically are
significantly higher during the fourth calendar quarter, primarily due to the increased demand for consumer software during the year-end holiday buying season. Net revenues and net income
in other quarters are generally lower and vary significantly as a result of new product introductions and other factors. On average in the past three fiscal years, the Company has earned approximately
14% of its net revenues in the quarter ending June 30

th

, 20% in the quarter ending September 30

th

, 45% in the quarter ending


December 31

st

and 21% in the quarter ending March 31

st

. The Company expects the seasonality pattern to continue.

Dependence On New Product Development; Product Delays.

The Company's future success depends in part on the timely
introduction of successful new products to replace declining revenues from older products. If, for any reason, revenues from new products were to fail to replace declining revenues from older
products, the Company's business, operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the Company believes that the competitive factors in the
marketplace for premium-priced interactive products create the need for higher quality, distinctive products that incorporate increasingly complex technology and sophisticated graphics, sound and
other effects and the need to support product releases with increased marketing, resulting in longer development periods and higher development, acquisition and marketing costs. The lack of market
acceptance or significant delay in the introduction of, or the presence of a defect in, one or more premium-priced products could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating
results and financial condition, particularly in view of the seasonality of the Company's business. Further, because a large portion of a product's revenue generally is associated with initial
shipments, the delay of a product introduction expected near the end of a fiscal quarter may have a material adverse effect on operating results for that quarter.

The
Company has, in the past, experienced significant delays in the introduction of certain new products. The timing and success of interactive entertainment software products remain
unpredictable due to the complexity of product development, including the uncertainty associated with technological developments. Although the Company has implemented substantial development controls,
there likely
will be delays in developing and introducing new products in the future. There can be no assurance that new products will be introduced on schedule, or at all, or that they will achieve market
acceptance or generate significant revenues.

Reliance on Third Party Developers and Independent Contractors.

The percentage of products published by the Company
that are developed by independent third party developers has increased significantly over the last several fiscal years. The Company also utilizes independent contractors for many aspects of products
that are developed internally by the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company has less control over the scheduling and the quality of work by independent contractors and third party developers than
that of its own employees. A delay in the work performed by independent contractors and third party developers or poor quality of such work may result in product delays. Although the Company intends
to continue releasing products that are developed primarily by its own employees and employees of its subsidiaries, the Company's ability to grow its business and its future operating results will
depend, in significant part, on the Company's continued ability to initiate and maintain relationships with skilled independent contractors and third party developers. There can be no assurance that
the Company will be able to initiate and maintain such relationships successfully in the future.

Uncertainty Of Market Acceptance; Short Product Life Cycles.

The market for interactive entertainment software
platforms and software products has been characterized by shifts in consumer preferences and short life cycles. Consumer preferences for entertainment and leisure software products are difficult to
predict and few such products achieve sustained market acceptance. There can be no assurance that new products introduced by the Company will achieve any significant degree of market acceptance, that
such acceptance will be sustained for any significant period, or that product life cycles will be sufficient to permit the Company to recoup product acquisition, development, marketing and other
associated costs. In addition, if market acceptance is not achieved, the Company could be forced to accept substantial product returns to maintain its relationships with retailers and its access to
distribution channels. Failure of new products to achieve or sustain market acceptance or product


returns in excess of the Company's expectations would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.

Product Concentration; Dependence On Hit Products.

The Company derives a significant portion of its revenues from a
relatively small number of products released each year. Many of these products have substantial development, production and acquisition costs and marketing budgets. In fiscal 2001, the Company had two
products which accounted for 11% and 18%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues. In fiscal 2000 the Company had two products which each accounted for approximately 10% of consolidated net
revenues. In fiscal 1999, no single product accounted for greater than 10% of consolidated net revenues. The Company anticipates that a relatively limited number of products will continue, in the
aggregate, to produce a disproportionate amount of revenues. Due to this dependence on a limited number of products, the failure of one or more of these products to achieve anticipated results may
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.

The
Company's strategy also includes as a key component publishing titles that have franchise value, such that sequels, conversions, enhancements and add-on products can
be released over time, thereby extending the life of the property in the market. While the focus on franchise properties, if successful, results in extending product life cycles, it also results in
the Company depending on a limited number of titles for its revenues. There can be no assurance that the Company's existing franchise titles can continue to be exploited as successfully as in the
past. In addition, new products that the Company believes will have potential value as franchise properties may not achieve market acceptance and therefore may not be a basis for future releases.

Industry Competition; Competition For Shelf Space.

The interactive entertainment and leisure industry is intensely
competitive. Competition is principally based on product quality and features, the compatibility of products with popular platforms, company or product line brand name recognition, access to
distribution channels, marketing effectiveness, reliability and ease of use, price and technical support. Significant financial resources also have become a competitive factor in this industry,
principally due to the substantial cost of product development and marketing that is required to support best-selling titles. In addition, competitors with broad product lines and popular
titles typically have greater leverage with distributors and other customers who may be willing to promote titles with less consumer appeal in return for access to such competitor's most popular
titles.

The
Company's competitors range from small companies with limited resources to large companies with substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than those of
the Company. The Company's competitors currently include Electronic Arts, Microsoft, Sony, Sega, Nintendo, Vivendi/Universal, Infogrames, THQ, Midway and Eidos, among many others.

The
interactive entertainment software industry is undergoing significant consolidation which allows the Company's largest competitors to exercise control over a growing number of
product lines and increasing concentration of development, financial and technical resources. As the Company's competitors grow stronger and competition increases, significant price pressure,
increased production costs and reduced profit margins may result. Prolonged price competition or reduced demand would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and
financial condition. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the Company will not
have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.

Retailers
typically have a limited amount of shelf space, and there is intense competition among interactive entertainment and leisure software producers for adequate levels of shelf
space and promotional support from retailers. As the number of interactive entertainment and leisure products increase, the competition for shelf space has intensified, resulting in greater leverage
for retailers and distributors in negotiating terms of sale, including price discounts and product return policies. The


Company's products constitute a relatively small percentage of a retailer's sales volume, and there can be no assurance that retailers will continue to purchase the Company's products or promote the
Company's products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support.

Dependence On Retailers and Distributors; Risk Of Customer Business Failure; Product Returns.

The Company depends on
access to retailers and distributors in order to market and sell its products. The loss of, or significant reduction in sales attributable to, any of the Company's principal distributors or retailers
could materially adversely affect the Company's business, operating results and financial condition. An increasing focus by companies on inventory management and the maintenance of minimum inventory
on-hand levels could affect the buying patterns of our principal distributors and retailers, thereby, resulting in less predictable purchasing patterns. Significant changes in the buying
patterns of the Company's major customers could impact the Company's ability to accurately forecast sales and, as a consequence, the necessary production to fill such sales, which could have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.

Retailers
in the computer and software industry have from time to time experienced significant fluctuations in their businesses and there have been a number of business failures among
these entities. The insolvency or business failure of any significant retailer or other wholesale purchaser of the Company's products could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
operating results and financial condition. Sales are typically made on credit, with terms that vary depending upon the customer and the nature of the product. The Company does not hold collateral to
secure payment. Although the Company has obtained insolvency risk insurance to protect against bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation that may occur to its customers, such insurance contains a
significant deductible as well as a co-payment obligation, and the policy does not cover all instances of non-payment. In addition, while the Company maintains a reserve for
uncollectible receivables that it believes to be adequate, the actual reserve which is maintained may not be sufficient in every circumstance. As a result of the foregoing, a payment default by a
significant customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.

The
Company also is exposed to the risk of product returns from retailers. Although the Company provides reserves for returns that it believes are adequate, and although the Company's
agreements with certain of its customers place certain limits on product returns, the Company could be forced to accept substantial product returns to maintain its relationships with retailers and its
access to distribution channels. Product returns that exceed the Company's reserves could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.

Changes In Technology and Industry Standards.

The consumer software industry is undergoing rapid changes, including
evolving industry standards, frequent new platform introductions and changes in consumer requirements and preferences. The introduction of new technologies, including new console systems such as the
Sony PlayStation 2, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo's GameCube and Game Boy Advance, technologies that support multi-player on-line games, and new media formats and methods of consumer
delivery such as on-line delivery and wireless game play, could render the Company's previously released products obsolete or unmarketable. The development cycle for products utilizing new
console platforms, computer operating systems and microprocessors or formats may be significantly longer and more expensive than the Company's current development cycle for products on existing
platforms, operating systems, microprocessors and formats and may require the Company to invest resources in products that may not become profitable. There can be no assurance that the mix of the
Company's future product offerings will keep pace with technological changes or satisfy evolving consumer preferences, or that the Company will be successful in developing and marketing products for
any future operating system or format. Failure to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in a timely fashion could result in significant product returns and inventory obsolescence
and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.


Risks Associated with Leverage.

In June 1999, the Company obtained a term loan and revolving credit facility
composed of a $25.0 million term loan and up to $100.0 million of revolving credit loans and letters of credit. The proceeds of the term loan were used to complete the acquisition of
Expert Software, Inc. and to pay expenses associated with the acquisition and the financing transaction. The revolving credit facility is used for working capital and general corporate
purposes. As of March 31, 2001, there was $8.5 million outstanding under the term loan. As of March 31, 2001 there were no borrowings outstanding and $18.2 million letters
of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2001, the Company also had outstanding $60.0 million of convertible subordinated notes due 2005.

Subsequent
to March 31, 2001, the Company called for the redemption of its $60.0 million convertible subordinated notes due 2005. In connection with that call, as of
June 20, 2001, holders have converted into common stock approximately $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of their convertible subordinated notes. Additionally, in May 2001,
the Company repaid in full the remaining $8.5 million balance of the term loan portion of the U.S. Facility. In conjunction with the accelerated repayment of the term loan, the Company amended
the U.S. Facility effective May 7, 2001. The amended and restated U.S. Facility eliminates the term loan, reduces the revolver to $78.0 million, reduces the interest rate to Prime plus
1.25% or LIBOR plus 2.25%, eliminates certain covenants, increases the advance rates and reduces the fee paid for maintenance of the facility.

The
revolving credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company and of its US subsidiaries. The facility contains various financial and other
covenants that the Company and its subsidiaries must comply with. If the Company were to default under the terms of the credit facility, either as a result of a failure to pay principal or interest
when due or as a result of a breach of a financial or other covenant, the lenders could stop providing funds and letters of credit to the Company and could declare an event of default and foreclose on
the collateral. A default by the Company under the revolving credit facility would materially adversely affect the Company's business and could result in the Company declaring bankruptcy.

Limited Protection Of Intellectual Property And Proprietary Rights; Risk Of Litigation.

The Company holds copyrights on
the products, manuals, advertising and other materials owned by it and maintains trademark rights in the

Activision

name, the

Activision

logo, and the
names of the products owned by
the Company. The Company regards its software as proprietary and relies primarily on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and
other methods to protect its proprietary rights. However, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the Company in the future with respect to current or
future products. As is common in the industry, from time to time the Company receives notices from third parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights of such parties. The Company
investigates these claims and responds as it deems appropriate. Any claims or litigation, with or without merit, could be costly and could result in a diversion of management's attention, which could
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition. Adverse determinations in such claims or litigation could also have a material adverse effect on
the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.

Unauthorized
copying and other forms of piracy are common within the software industry, and if a significant amount of unauthorized copying of the Company's products were to occur,
the Company's business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely effected. Policing unauthorized use of the Company's products is difficult, and while the Company is unable to
determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists, software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem. In selling its products, the Company relies primarily on "shrink wrap"
licenses that are not signed by licensees and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Further, the Company enters into transactions in countries where intellectual
property laws are not well developed


and are poorly enforced. Legal protections of the Company's rights may be ineffective in such countries.

Dependence On Key Personnel.

The Company's success depends to a significant extent on the performance and continued
service of its senior management and certain key employees. Competition for highly skilled employees with technical, management, marketing, sales, product development and other specialized training is
intense, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Specifically, the Company may experience increased costs in order to attract and
retain skilled employees. Although the Company enters into term employment agreements with most of its skilled employees and management personnel, there can be no assurance that such employees will
not leave the Company or compete against the Company. The Company's failure to attract or retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results
and financial condition.

Risks Associated With International Operations; Currency Fluctuations.

International sales and licensing accounted for
43%, 51% and 66% of the Company's total revenues in the fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company intends to continue to emphasize its direct and indirect sales, marketing and
localization activities worldwide. This emphasis will require significant management time and attention and financial resources in order to develop adequate international sales and support channels.
The Company may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for its products. International sales are subject to inherent risks, including the impact of possible recessionary
environments in economies outside the United States, currency fluctuations, the costs of transferring
and localizing products for foreign markets, longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, difficulties
and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations, and political and economic instability. The Company may not be able to sustain or increase international revenues and the foregoing factors may
have a material adverse effect on the Company's future international revenues and, consequently, on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition. The Company currently does not
engage in currency hedging activities. Although exposure to currency fluctuations to date has been insignificant, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may in the future have a material adverse
impact on revenues from international sales and licensing and thus the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.

Risk Of Defects.

Interactive software products such as those offered by the Company frequently contain errors or
defects. Despite extensive product testing, in the past the Company has released products with defects and has discovered errors in certain of its product offerings after their introduction. In
particular, the PC hardware environment is characterized by a wide variety of non-standard peripherals (such as sound cards and graphics cards) and hardware configurations that make
pre-release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time-consuming. Despite testing by the Company, new products or releases may contain errors after
commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in a loss of or delay in market acceptance, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial
condition.

Risks Associated With Acquisitions.

As the Company executes acquisitions, it must integrate the operations of its
acquired subsidiaries with its previously existing operations. This process, as well as the process of managing new operations, requires substantial management time and effort and diverts the
attention of management from other matters. In addition, there is a risk of loss of key employees, customers and vendors of the recently acquired operations as well as existing operations as this
process is implemented. The Company may not be successful in integrating these operations.

Consistent
with the Company's strategy of enhancing its distribution and product development capabilities, the Company intends to continue to pursue acquisitions of companies,
intellectual property rights and other assets that can be purchased or licensed on acceptable terms and which the Company


believes can be operated or exploited profitably. Some of these transactions could be material in size and scope. While the Company will continually be searching for appropriate acquisition
opportunities, the Company may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisitions. If any potential acquisition opportunities are identified, the Company may not be able to consummate such
acquisitions and if any such acquisition does occur, it may not enhance the Company's business or be accretive to the Company's earnings. As the interactive entertainment and leisure industry
continues to consolidate, the Company faces significant competition in seeking acquisitions and may in the future face increased competition for acquisition opportunities. This may inhibit the
Company's ability to complete suitable transactions. Future acquisitions could also divert substantial management time, could result in short term reductions in earnings or special transaction or
other charges and may be difficult to integrate with existing operations or assets.

The
Company may, in the future, issue additional shares of common stock in connection with one or more acquisitions, which may dilute its existing shareholders. The Company's
shareholders will not have an opportunity, with respect to most of the Company's future acquisitions, to review the financial statements of the entity being acquired or to evaluate the benefits of the
intellectual property rights being purchased or licensed, or to vote on the acquisitions.

Risk of Distribution Companies' Vendor Defections; Vendor Concentration.

The Company's CD Contact, NBG and CentreSoft
subsidiaries perform interactive entertainment distribution services in the Benelux territories, Germany and in the United Kingdom, respectively, and, via export, in other European territories for a
variety of entertainment software publishers, many of which are competitors of the Company. These services are generally performed under limited term contracts, some of which provide for cancellation
in the event of a change of control. While the Company expects to use reasonable efforts to retain these vendors, the Company may not be successful in this regard. The cancellation or
non-renewal of one or more of these contracts could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition. Three of CD Contact's third party
vendors each accounted for approximately 11% of CD Contact's net revenues in fiscal year 2001. The net revenues from each of these vendors represented less than 1% of consolidated net revenues of the
Company for this period. Two of CentreSoft's third party vendors accounted for 16%, and 11%, respectively, of CentreSoft's net revenues in fiscal year 2001. The net revenues from these vendors
represented 3% and 2%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues of the Company for this period. One of NBG's third party vendors accounted for approximately 15% of NBG's net revenues in fiscal year
2001. The net revenues from this vendor represented 1% of consolidated net revenues of the Company for this period. All other third party vendors contributed less than 10% individually to the
respective subsidiary's net revenues.

Risks Associated with Fluctuations in Stock Value.

Due to analysts' expectations of continued growth and other factors,
any shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the Company's common stock in any given period. As a result of the factors discussed in this
report and other factors that may arise in the future, the market price of the Company's common stock historically has been, and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations over a short
period of time. These fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the Company, to changes in analysts' earnings estimates, or to factors affecting the computer, software, entertainment, media or
electronics industries or the securities markets in general.


Strategy

The Company's objective is to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing and distribution of quality interactive entertainment and leisure products
that deliver, at each point of the value spectrum, a highly satisfying experience. The Company's strategy includes the following elements:

Create and Maintain a Balanced and Diversified Portfolio of Operations.

The Company has assembled a large diversified
portfolio of development, publishing and distribution operations and relationships which are complementary and, at the same time, reduce the Company's risk of concentration on any one developer,
brand, platform, customer or market. The Company has focused historically on the development and publishing of premium products that provide the most sophisticated game play and entertainment
experience at the top price point. While the Company will continue to take advantage of its expertise in this area, it has continued to diversify its business operations and product and audience mix.
In addition to establishing, primarily through acquisitions, the European distribution business, the Company believes that as a result of its acquisition activities, it has positioned itself as a
leading publisher of "value" products for the PC, which are characterized by less sophisticated game play and lower price points. Further, the Company publishes and distributes titles that operate on
a variety of platforms (PC, Sony PlayStation and PlayStation 2, Sega Dreamcast and Nintendo N64 and Game Boy). The Company is also currently focusing on the development of products for Microsoft's
Xbox and Nintendo's GameCube and Game Boy Advance. This diversification helps to reduce the risk of downturn or underperformance in any of the Company's individual operations.

Create and Maintain Strong Brands.

The Company focuses its development and publishing activities principally on titles
that are, or have the potential to become, franchise properties with sustainable consumer appeal and brand recognition. These titles can thereby serve as the basis for sequels, prequels, mission
packs, other add-ons and related new titles that can be released over an extended period of time. The Company believes that the publishing and distribution of products based in large part
on franchise properties enhances revenue predictability and the probability of high unit volume sales and operating profits. In addition, the Company has entered into a series of strategic
partnerships with the owners of intellectual property pursuant to which the Company has acquired the rights to publish titles based on franchises such as

Star
Trek,

various Disney films such as

Toy Story 2

, and Marvel Comic's properties such as

Spiderman,
X-Men

and

Blade.

The Company also has capitalized on the success of its

Tony Hawk Pro
Skater

products to sign long term agreements with superstars of extreme sports such as Mat Hoffman in BMX pro biking, Kelly Slater in pro surfing, Shaun Palmer in snow boarding
and Shaun Murray in wake boarding.

Focus on On-Time Delivery.

The success of the Company's publishing business is dependent, in significant
part, on its ability to develop games that will generate high unit volume sales that can be completed in accordance with planned budgets and schedules. In order to increase its ability to achieve this
objective, the Company's publishing units have implemented a formal control process for the development of the Company's products. This process includes three key elements:
(i) in-depth reviews are conducted for each project at five intervals during the development process by a team that includes several of the Company's highest ranking operating
managers; (ii) each project is led by a small team which is given incentives to deliver a high-quality product, on-schedule and within budget; and
(iii) day-to-day progress is monitored by a dedicated process manager in order to insure that issues, if any, are promptly identified and addressed in a timely manner.

Leverage Infrastructure and Organization.

The Company is continually striving to reduce its risk and increase its
operating leverage and efficiency. For example, the Company has significantly increased its product making capabilities by allocating a larger portion of its product development investments to
experienced independent development companies. These companies generally are small firms focused on a particular product type of game and are run and owned by individuals who are willing to take


development risk by accepting payments based on the completion of fixed performance milestones in exchange for a royalty on the revenue stream of the game after the Company recoups its development
costs. The Company also has broadly instituted objective-based reward programs that provide incentives to management and staff to produce results that meet the Company's financial objectives.

Grow Through Continued Strategic Acquisitions.

The interactive entertainment and leisure industry is consolidating, and
the Company believes that success in this industry will be driven in part by the ability to take advantage of scale. Specifically, smaller companies are more capital constrained, enjoy less
predictability of revenues and cash flow, lack product diversity and must spread fixed costs over a smaller revenue base. Several industry leaders are emerging that combine the entrepreneurial and
creative spirit of the industry with professional management, the ability to access the capital markets and the ability to maintain favorable relationships with strategic developers, property owners
and retailers. Through nine completed acquisitions since 1997, the Company believes that it has successfully diversified its operations, its channels of distribution, its development talent pool and
its library of titles, and has emerged as one of the industry's leaders.

Products

The Company historically has been best known for its action, adventure, strategy and simulation products. With the successful introduction of its

Tony Hawk Pro Skater

and

Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2

products, the Company also has become one of the
industry leaders in the extreme sport category. The Company also distributes products in other categories such as leisure and role playing. The Company may in the future expand its product offerings
into new categories.

The
Company's current and upcoming releases are based on intellectual property and other character or story rights licensed from third parties, as well as a combination of characters,
worlds and concepts derived from the Company's extensive library of titles, and original characters and concepts owned and created by the Company. In publishing products based on licensed intellectual
property rights, the Company generally seeks to capitalize on the name recognition, marketing efforts and goodwill associated with the underlying property.

In
the past years, the Company has entered into a series of long term or multi-product agreements with the owners of intellectual property that is well known throughout the world. In
addition to the strategic relationships established by the Company with Disney Interactive for several animated film properties, with Viacom Consumer Products for

Star
Trek

and with Lucas Arts Entertainment for

Star Wars

and

Indiana Jones

, the
Company also has entered into long term license agreements with Cabela's for its

Big Game Hunter

series of products, Marvel Comics for such properties
as

Spiderman, X-Men

and

Blade

, BBC Television for

The Weakest
Link

and such superstars of extreme sports as Tony Hawk

,

Mat Hoffman, Kelly Slater, Shaun Palmer and Shaun Murray. The Company
may not be able to seek out and sustain new long term relationships of similar caliber in the future.

In
addition to its own internally developed products, the Company publishes and distributes software products for other independent developers and publishers such as id Software,
Eidos and Fox. As the Company seeks to associate the

"Activision"

mark only with the highest quality interactive entertainment products, the Company
attempts to be selective in acquiring publishing and distribution rights from third party developers. Such products typically are marketed under the Company's name as well as the name of the original
developer. The Company believes that these efforts enable the Company to leverage its investment in worldwide sales and marketing and add a new source of products while balancing the risks inherent in
internal product development and production. This activity also allows the Company to enter new product genres more quickly and provide consumers with a wider variety of products.

The
Company has established itself as a leader in the "value priced" software publishing business with such products as Cabela's

Big Game
Hunter

series and

Ski Resort Tycoon

. Products published by


the Company in this category are generally developed by third parties, often under contract with the Company, and are marketed under the Activision Value and Head Games names.

Product Development and Support

The Company uses both internal and external resources to develop products. The Company also acquires rights to products through publishing and distribution
arrangements with other interactive entertainment and leisure companies.

Internal Development

The Company's internal development and production groups are located at the Company's operational bases in California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, the United Kingdom
and Japan.

Activision
internally develops and produces titles using a model in which a core group of creative, production and technical professionals on staff at the Company, in cooperation with
the Company's marketing and finance departments, have overall responsibility for the entire development and production process and for the supervision and coordination of internal and external
resources. This team assembles the necessary creative elements to complete a title, using, where appropriate, outside programmers, artists, animators, musicians and songwriters, sound effects and
special effects experts, and sound and video studios. The Company believes that this model allows the Company to supplement internal expertise with top quality external resources on an as needed
basis.

The
Company has adopted and implemented a rigorous procedure for the selection, development, production and quality assurance of its internally produced entertainment software titles.
The process, entitled the Greenlight Process, involves one or more pre-development, development and production phases, each of which includes a number of specific performance milestones.
This procedure is designed to enable the Company to manage and control production and development budgets and timetables, to identify and address production and technical issues at the earliest
opportunity, and to coordinate marketing and quality control strategies throughout the production and development phases, all in an environment that fosters creativity. Checks and balances are
intended to be provided through the structured interaction of the project team with the Company's creative, technical, marketing and quality assurance/customer support personnel, as well as the legal,
accounting and finance departments.

External Development

The Company licenses or acquires software products from independent developers for publishing or distribution by the Company. Acquired titles generally are
marketed under the Company's name as well as the name of the original developer. The agreements with developers provide the Company with exclusive publishing and/or distribution rights for a specific
period of time for specified platforms and territories. These agreements often grant to the Company the right to publish and/or distribute sequels, conversions, enhancements and add-ons to
the product originally being developed and produced by the developer. In consideration for its services, the developer receives a royalty based on net sales of the product that it has developed.
Typically, the developer also receives a nonrefundable advance which is recoupable by the Company from the royalties otherwise required to be paid to the developer. The royalty generally is paid in
stages, with the payment of each stage tied to the completion of a detailed performance milestone.

The
Company acquires titles from developers during various phases of the development and production processes for such titles. To the extent the Company acquires rights early in the
development process, the Company generally will cause the independent developer to comply with the requirements of the pre-development, development and production processes applicable to
titles internally produced by Activision. The Company will assign a game producer to each title who will serve as the principal liaison to the independent developer and help insure that performance
milestones


are timely met. The Company generally has the right to cease making payments to an independent developer if the developer fails to complete its performance milestones in a timely fashion.

The
Company may make, from time to time, an investment and hold a minority equity interest in the third party developer in connection with entertainment software products to be
developed by each of these developers for the Company, which the Company believes helps to create a closer relationship between the Company and the developer. The Company has a minority interest in
Pandemic Studios, Raster Productions and Gray Matter Studios. There can be no assurance that the Company will realize long term benefits from such type of investments or that it will continue to carry
such investments at its current value.

Product Support

The Company provides various forms of product support to both its internally and externally developed titles. The Company's quality assurance personnel are
involved throughout the development and production processes for each title published by the Company. All such products are subjected to extensive testing before release in order to ensure
compatibility with the widest possible array of hardware configurations and to minimize the number of bugs and other defects found in the products. To support its products after release, the Company
provides on-line support to its customers on a 24-hour basis as well as operator help lines during regular business hours. The customer support group tracks customer inquiries
and this data is used to help improve the development and production processes.

Publishing and Distribution Activities

Marketing

The Company's marketing efforts include on-line activities (such as the creation of World Wide Web pages to promote specific Company titles),
public relations, print and broadcast advertising, coordinated in-store and industry promotions including merchandising and point of purchase displays, participation in cooperative
advertising programs, direct response vehicles, and product sampling through demonstration software distributed through the Internet or on compact discs. In addition, the Company's products contain
software that enables customers to "electronically register" their purchases with the Company on-line.

The
Company believes that certain of its franchise properties have loyal and devoted audiences who purchase the Company's sequels as a result of dedication to the property and
satisfaction from previous product purchases. Marketing of these sequels is therefore directed both toward the established market as well as broader audiences. In marketing titles based on licensed
properties, the Company believes that it derives marketing synergies and related benefits from the marketing and promotional activities of the property owners. In marketing titles owned by third party
developers, the Company believes that it derives marketing synergies and related benefits from the previously established reputation of and goodwill associated with the developer and/or properties
owned by the developer.

Sales and Distribution

Domestic Sales and Distribution.

The Company's products are available for sale or rental in thousands of retail outlets
domestically. The Company's domestic customers include Best Buy, CompUSA, Computer City, Electronic Boutique, Babbages, Wal-Mart, K-Mart, Target and Toys "R" Us. During fiscal
2001, one customer accounted for approximately 10% of consolidated net revenues. During fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, no single domestic customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net
revenues.


In the United States, the Company's products are sold primarily on a direct basis to major computer and software retailing organizations, mass market retailers, consumer electronic
stores and discount warehouses and mail order companies. The Company believes that a direct relationship with retail accounts results in more effective inventory management, merchandising and
communications than would be possible through indirect relationships. The Company has implemented electronic data interchange ("EDI") linkage with many of its retailers to facilitate the placing and
shipping of orders. The Company seeks to continue to increase the number of retail outlets reached directly through its internal sales force. The Company utilizes wholesale distributors such as Ingram
Entertainment to service independent channels.

International Sales and Distribution.

The Company conducts its international publishing and distribution activities
through offices in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium and Japan. The Company seeks to maximize its worldwide revenues and profits by releasing high
quality foreign language localizations concurrently with the English language releases, whenever practicable, and by continuing to expand the number of direct selling relationships it maintains with
key retailers in major territories. As part of the restructuring plan adopted in March 2000, described in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations," the Company realigned its direct distribution system and restructured its worldwide distributor relationships, significantly reducing the number of distributors.

In
November 1997, the Company commenced its European distribution operations through the acquisitions of NBG in Germany and CentreSoft in the United Kingdom. CentreSoft is
Sony's exclusive distributor of PlayStation products to the independent channel in the United Kingdom and employs approximately 168 people, including one of the largest entertainment software sales
and marketing organizations in that country. In September 1998, the Company acquired CD Contact, a company specializing in the localization and marketing of entertainment software products in
the Benelux territories. The assets and personnel of CD Contact have been integrated with the Company's other distribution operations to form the core of Activision's international distribution
operations.

Affiliate Labels.

In addition to its own products, the Company distributes interactive entertainment products that are
developed and marketed by other third party publishers through its "affiliate label" programs. The distribution of other publishers' products allows the Company to maximize the efficiencies of its
sales force and provides the Company with the ability to better ensure adequate shelf presence at retail stores for all of the products that it distributes. It also mitigates the risk associated with
a particular title or titles published by Activision failing to achieve expectations. Services provided by the Company under its affiliate label program include order solicitation,
in-store marketing, logistics and order fulfillment, sales channel management, as well as other accounting and general administrative functions.

During
the fiscal year 2001, the Company's affiliate label partners included Lucas Arts, Psygnosis, Fox Interactive, Interplay, Codemasters, 989 Studios and Encore Entertainment. Each
affiliate label relationship is unique and may pertain only to distribution in certain geographic territories such as the United States or Europe and may be further limited only to the specifically
named titles or titles operating on specific platforms.

Internet

The Company believes that there are opportunities for further exploitation of its titles through the Internet, on-line services, and dedicated
Internet on-line gaming services. The Company is actively exploring the establishment of on-line game playing opportunities and Internet services as a method for realizing
additional revenues from its products. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in exploiting these opportunities. The Company has been operating its on-line store
under a


third party fulfillment arrangement with Digital River, where customers can order a wide array of Activision titles.

Hardware Licenses

The Company's console products currently are being developed or published primarily for the Sony PlayStation and PlayStation 2, Nintendo N64, GameCube and Game
Boy handheld devices, Microsoft Xbox, and Sega Dreamcast. In order to maintain general access to the console systems marketplace, the Company has obtained licenses for each of these platforms. Each
license allows the Company to create one or more products for the applicable system, subject to certain approval rights as to quality which are reserved by each licensor. Each license also requires
that the Company pay the licensor a per unit license fee for each unit manufactured.

In
contrast, the Company currently is not required to obtain any license for the development and production of PC-CD products. Accordingly, the Company's per unit
manufacturing cost for PC-CD products is less than the per unit manufacturing cost for console products.

Manufacturing

The Company prepares a set of master program copies, documentation and packaging materials for its products for each respective hardware platform on which the
product will be released. Except with respect to products for use on the Sony and Nintendo systems, the Company's disk duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly and
shipping are performed by third party subcontractors.

In
the case of products for the Sony and Nintendo systems, in order to maintain protection over their hardware technologies, such hardware producers generally specify and/or control
the manufacturing and assembly of finished products. The Company delivers the master materials to the licensor or its approved replicator which then manufactures finished goods and delivers them to
the Company for distribution under the Company's label. At the time the Company's product unit orders are filled by the manufacturer, the Company becomes responsible for the costs of manufacturing and
the applicable per unit royalty on such units, even if the units do not ultimately sell.

To
date, the Company has not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the manufacture and assembly of its products or material returns due to product defects.

Competition

The interactive entertainment and leisure industry is intensely competitive and is in the process of substantial consolidation. The availability of significant
financial resources has become a major competitive factor in this industry primarily as a result of the increasing development, acquisition,
production and marketing budgets required to publish quality titles. In addition, competitors with large product lines and popular titles typically have greater leverage with distributors and other
customers who may be willing to promote titles with less consumer appeal in return for access to such competitor's most popular titles. See "Factors Affecting Future Performance".

The
Company seeks to compete by publishing high quality titles and by supporting these titles with substantial marketing efforts; by focusing on properties with sustainable consumer
appeal; by working to strengthen its relationships with retailers and other resellers and otherwise expanding its channels of distribution; and by pursuing opportunities for strategic acquisitions.
See "Strategy."


Employees

As of March 31, 2001, the Company had 764 employees, including 258 in product development, 61 in North American publishing, 110 in corporate finance,
operations and administration, 77 in international publishing, and 258 in European distribution activities.

As
of March 31, 2001, approximately 110 of the Company's full-time employees were subject to term employment agreements with the Company. These agreements generally
commit such employees to employment terms of between one and three years from the commencement of their respective agreements. Most of the employees subject to such agreements are executives of the
Company or members of the product development, sales or marketing divisions. These individuals perform services for the Company as executives, directors, producers, associate producers, computer
programmers, game designers, sales directors and marketing product managers. The execution by the Company of employment agreements with such employees, in the Company's experience, significantly
reduces the Company's turnover during the development and production of its entertainment software products and allows the Company to plan more effectively for future development activities.

None
of the Company's employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and the Company has experienced no labor-related work stoppages.

Dividends

The Company paid no cash dividends in 2001 or 2000 and does not intend to pay any cash dividends at any time in the foreseeable future. The Company expects
that earnings will be retained for the continued growth and development of the Company's business. In addition, the Company's bank credit facility currently prohibits the Company from paying dividends
on its common stock. Future dividends, if any, will depend upon the Company's earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Company's
Board of Directors.

Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities

In 1998, the Company granted warrants to purchase 750,000 shares of the Company's common stock to Viacom International Inc. ("Viacom"), an affiliate of
Viacom Consumer Products, Inc. ("VCP"), in connection with, and as partial consideration for, a license agreement between VCP and the Company that gives the Company the right to utilize
intellectual properties associated with the

Star Trek

television series' and films in conjunction with Activision products. Warrants to purchase 500,000
share of the Company's common stock have an exercise price of $10.27 per share, vested upon grant, have a ten year term and become exercisable ratably over a five year term. The remaining warrants
vested upon grant, have a ten year term, become exercisable ratably over a five year term beginning on September 16, 2003 and have an exercise price based on the average closing price of the
Company's common stock for the 30 trading days preceding September 16, 2003.

In
September 1998, the Company granted warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock to Disney Entertainment, Inc. ("Disney") as partial
consideration for a license


agreement between Disney and the Company that gives the Company the right to utilize intellectual properties associated with certain Disney animated films in conjunction with Activision products.

In
May 1999, the Company granted warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $11.63 per share to Cabela's, Incorporated
("Cabela's") in connection with, and as partial consideration for, a license agreement that allows the Company to utilize the Cabela's name in conjunction with certain Activision products. The
warrants vested upon grant, have a seven year term and are exercisable in annual increments over the warrant term.

In
June 1999, the Company issued 204,448 shares of its common stock in connection with the acquisition of Elsinore Multimedia, Inc.

In
September 1999, the Company issued 698,835 shares of its common stock in connection with the acquisition of JCM Productions, Inc. dba Neversoft Entertainment.

In
December 1999, the Company issued 77,031 shares of its common stock in connection with a 40% equity investment in Gray Matter Studios, formerly known as Video Games
West, Inc.

None
of the shares, warrants, options or shares into which the warrants or options are exercisable were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
by reason of the exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Company subsequently registered the shares issued in connection with the Elsinore Multimedia, Inc., JCM
Productions, Inc. dba Neversoft Entertainment and Gray Matter Studios transactions for resale by the holders thereof.

Repurchase Plan

As of May 9, 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $15.0 million in shares of its common stock as well as its
convertible subordinated notes. The shares and notes could be purchased from time to time through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The amount of shares and notes purchased and
the timing of purchases were based on a number of factors, including the market price of the shares and notes, market conditions, and such other factors as the Company's management deemed appropriate.
The Company has financed the purchase of shares with available cash. During the quarter ended June 30, 2000 the Company repurchased 2.3 million shares of its common stock for
approximately $15.0 million.

Shareholders' Rights Plan

On April 18, 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a shareholders rights plan (the "Rights Plan"). Under the Rights Plan, each common
stockholder at the close of business on April 19, 2000 will receive a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held. Each right represents the right to purchase one
one-hundredth (1/100) of a share of the Company's Series A Junior Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $40.00. Initially, the rights are represented by the Company's common stock
certificates and are neither exercisable nor traded separately from the Company's common stock. The rights will only become exercisable if a person or group acquires 15% or more of the common stock of
the Company, or announces or commences a tender or exchange offer which would result in the bidder's beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company's common stock.

In
the event that any person or group acquires 15% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock each holder of a right (other than such person or members of such group) will
thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such right, in lieu of shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock, the number of shares of common stock of the Company having a value equal
to two times the then current exercise price of the right. If the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person has acquired 15% or more the Company's common
stock, each holder of a right will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such right a number of the acquiring company's common shares having a market value equal to two times the then


current exercise price of the right. For persons who, as of the close of business on April 18, 2000, beneficially own 15% or more of the common stock of the Company, the Rights Plan
"grandfathers" their current level of ownership, so long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of certain limitations.

The
Company may redeem the rights for $.01 per right at any time until the first public announcement of the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 15% of the Company's common stock.
At any time after a person has acquired 15% or more (but before any person has acquired more than 50%) of the Company's common stock, the Company may exchange all or part of the rights for shares of

EBITDA
represents income (loss) before interest, income taxes and, depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and goodwill. The Company believes that EBITDA provides
useful information regarding the Company's ability to service its debt; however, EBITDA does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should
not be considered a substitute for net income, as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or cash flow or as a measure of liquidity.


Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

The Company is a leading international publisher, developer and distributor of interactive entertainment and leisure products. The Company currently focuses
its publishing, development and distribution efforts on products designed for personal computers ("PCs") as well as the Sony PlayStation ("PSX") and PlayStation 2 ("PS2") and Nintendo N64
("N64") console systems and Nintendo Game Boy handheld game devices. The Company is also currently focusing on the development of products for Microsoft Xbox ("Xbox") and Nintendo GameCube console
systems and Nintendo Game Boy Advance hand held device. During January 2001, Sega Corp., the maker of the Sega Dreamcast ("Dreamcast") console system announced that it would quit making the
Dreamcast in March 2001. Net revenues from the Dreamcast have historically represented only a small percentage of the Company's total net revenues. Accordingly, the Company believes that the
departure of the Dreamcast console system from the market will not have a material impact upon its financial position or results of operations.

The
Company distributes its products worldwide through its direct sales forces, through its distribution subsidiaries, and through third party distributors and licensees.

The
Company's financial information as of and for the year ended March 31, 1999 has been restated to reflect the effect of pooling of interests transactions as discussed in
Item 1 and Item 6 of this Report.

The
Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products once they are shipped and are available for general release to customers. Subject to certain limitations, the Company
permits customers to obtain exchanges and returns within certain specified periods and provides price protection on certain unsold merchandise. Revenue from product sales is reflected after deducting
the estimated allowance for returns and price protection. Management of the Company estimates the amount of future returns and price protection based upon historical results and current known
circumstances. With respect to license agreements that provide customers the right to multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenue is recognized upon delivery. Per copy royalties on
sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned.

Cost
of sales-product costs represents the cost to purchase, manufacture and distribute PC and console product units. Manufacturers of the Company's PC software are located worldwide
and are readily available. Console CDs and cartridges are manufactured by the respective video game console manufacturers, Sony, Nintendo and Sega or its agents, who often require significant lead
time to fulfill the Company's orders.

Cost
of sales-royalties and software amortization represents amounts due developers, product owners and other royalty participants as a result of product sales, as well as
amortization of capitalized software development costs. The costs incurred by the Company to develop products are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards that provide for the
capitalization of certain software development costs once technological feasibility is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable. Additionally, various contracts are maintained with
developers, product owners or other royalty participants, which state a royalty rate, territory and term of agreement, among other items. Commencing upon product release, prepaid royalties and
capitalized software costs are amortized to cost of salesâ€”royalties and software amortization based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues, generally resulting in an
amortization period of one year or less.

For
products that have been released, management evaluates the future recoverability of prepaid royalties and capitalized software costs on a quarterly basis. Prior to a product's
release, the Company charges to expense, as part of product development costs, capitalized costs when, in management's


estimate, such amounts are not recoverable. The following criteria is used to evaluate recoverability: historical performance of comparable products; the commercial acceptance of prior products
released on a given game engine; orders for the product prior to its release; estimated performance of a sequel product based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based; and actual
development costs of a product as compared to the Company's budgeted amount.

The
following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total net revenues and also breaks down net revenues by
territory and platform, as well as operating income by business segment:

Results of Operationsâ€”Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2001 and 2000

Net income for fiscal year 2001 was $20.5 million or $0.75 per diluted share, as compared to net loss of $34.1 million or $1.38 per diluted share
in fiscal year 2000. The 2000 results were negatively impacted by a strategic restructuring charge totaling $70.2 million, approximately $61.8 million net of tax, or $2.50 per diluted
share. See the analysis of the results of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2000 and 1999 for a detailed discussion of the restructuring plan. During fiscal 2001, the Company
completed those restructuring initiatives.

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2001 increased 8% from the same period last year, from $572.2 million to $620.2 million. This
increase was driven by the performance of the Company's publishing segment, partially offset by declines experienced in the Company's distribution segment.

Publishing
net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2001 increased 17% from $396.7 million to $466.1 million. This increase primarily was due to publishing
console net revenues increasing 24% from $281.2 million to $349.5 million. The increase in publishing console net revenues was attributable to the release in fiscal 2001 of several
titles that sold very well in the marketplace, including

Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2

(PSX, Dreamcast and Game Boy),

Spiderman

(PSX, N64 and Game Boy),

X-Men Mutant Academy

(PSX and Game Boy), as well as
continuing strong sales of the original

Tony Hawk Pro Skater

(PSX and N64). Publishing PC net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2001 remained
relatively constant with the prior year, increasing 1% from $115.5 million to $116.5 million.

For
the year ended March 31, 2001, distribution net revenues decreased 12% from prior fiscal year from $175.5 million to $154.1 million. The decrease was mainly
attributable to the continued weakness in the European console market as a result of the transition to next-generation console systems. Based on previous new hardware launches, the Company
expects that its distribution business will benefits in future periods from the introduction of PS2 and other next-generation consoles. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, distribution
had its best results in eight quarters, reflecting the accelerating opportunities from the introduction of new console systems.

Domestic
net revenues grew 25.0% from $282.8 million to $352.9 million. International net revenues decreased by 8% from $289.4 million to $267.3 million.
The increase in domestic net revenues is reflective of the increases in the Company's publishing segment as described above and the decrease in international net revenues is reflective of the declines
in the Company's distribution segment as described above.

Costs and Expenses

Cost of salesâ€”product costs represented 52% and 56% of net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease
in cost of salesâ€”product costs as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2001 was due to the decrease in distribution net revenue, partially offset by a higher
publishing console net revenue mix. Distribution products have a higher per unit product cost than publishing products, and console products have a higher per unit product cost than PC products.

Cost
of salesâ€”royalty and software amortization expense represented 14% and 16% of net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
decrease in cost of salesâ€”royalty and software amortization expense as a percentage of net revenues is reflective of the $11.9 million of write-offs recorded in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 relating to the Company's restructuring plan as later described in the analysis of the results of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2000 and 1999.


Product development expenses of $41.4 million and $26.3 million represented 8% and 5% of net revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. These increases in product development expenses in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues reflect the Company's investment in the development of products for
next-generation console and hand-held devices, including PS2, Xbox, GameCube and Game Boy Advance. The increases are also reflective of the increase in the number of titles
expected to be released in fiscal 2002, 52 titles, compared to fiscal 2001, 35 titles. Of the 52 titles expected to be released in fiscal 2002, 19 titles are for next-generation platforms,
which have higher development costs than existing-platform titles.

Sales
and marketing expenses of $85.4 million and $87.3 million represented 14% and 15% of net revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. This decrease reflects the Company's ability to generate savings by building on the existing awareness of our branded products and sequel titles sold during fiscal 2001.

General
and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2001 remained constant with the prior fiscal year, increasing 2% from $36.7 million to
$37.5 million. As a percentage of net revenues, fiscal 2001 general and administrative expenses also remained relatively constant with the prior fiscal year at approximately 6%.

Amortization
of intangibles decreased substantially from $41.6 million in fiscal 2000 to $1.5 million in fiscal 2001. This was due to the write-off in fiscal
2000 of goodwill acquired in purchase acquisitions in conjunction with the Company's restructuring plan as subsequently described.

Operating Income (Loss)

Operating income (loss) for the year ended March 31, 2001, was $39.8 million, compared to $(30.3) million in fiscal 2000. This increase in
consolidated operating income is primarily the result of increased operating income in the Company's publishing business.

Publishing
operating income (loss) for the year ended March 31, 2001 increased to $35.7 million, compared to $(35.0) million in the prior fiscal year. The increase
reflects the charges incurred in fiscal 2000 in conjunction with the Company's restructuring plan as subsequently described, which predominantly impacted the Company's publishing segment. Distribution
operating income for the year ended March 31, 2001 remained flat at $4.1 million, compared to $4.7 million in the prior fiscal year.

Other Income (Expense)

Interest expense, net of interest income, decreased to $7.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2001, from $8.4 million for the year
ended March 31, 2000. This decrease in interest expense was due to lower average borrowings on the revolving portion of the Company's $125.0 million term loan and revolving credit
facility (the "U.S. Facility") during fiscal 2001 when compared to prior fiscal year, as well as increased interest earned as a result of higher investable cash balances throughout the year.

Provision for Income Taxes

The income tax provision of $12.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, reflects the Company's effective income tax rate of
approximately 37%. The significant items generating the variance between the Company's effective rate and its statutory rate of 35% are state taxes and nondeductible goodwill amortization, partially
offset by a decrease in the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance and research and development tax credits. The realization of deferred tax assets primarily is dependent on the generation
of future taxable income. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate taxable income sufficient to realize the benefit of net deferred tax assets recognized.


Results of Operationsâ€”Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2000 and 1999

Net loss for fiscal year 2000 was $34.1 million or $1.38 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $14.9 million or $0.62 per diluted share
in fiscal year 1999. The 2000 results were negatively impacted by a strategic restructuring charge totaling $70.2 million, approximately $61.8 million net of tax, or $2.50 per diluted
share.

Strategic Restructuring Plan

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company finalized a strategic restructuring plan to accelerate the development and sale of interactive entertainment
and leisure products for the next-generation consoles and the Internet. Costs associated with this plan amounted to $70.2 million, approximately $61.8 million net of taxes,
and were recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000 and classified as follows (amounts in millions):

Net revenues

Cost of salesâ€”royalties and software amortization

Product development

General and administrative

5.2

Amortization of intangible assets

$

70.2

The
component of the charge included in amortization of intangible assets represented a write down of intangibles including goodwill, relating to Expert Software, Inc.
("Expert"), one of the Company's value publishing subsidiaries, totaling $26.3 million. The Company consolidated Expert into Head Games, forming one integrated business unit. As part of this
consolidation, the Company discontinued substantially all of Expert's product lines, terminated substantially all of Expert's employees and phased out the use of the Expert name. In addition, a
$10.9 million write down of goodwill relating to TDC, an OEM business unit, was recorded. During fiscal 1999, the OEM market went through radical changes due to price declines of PCs and
hardware accessories. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flow of these assets was not sufficient to cover the carrying value of these assets and as such was written down to fair market value.

The
component of the charge included in net revenues and general and administrative expense represents costs associated with the planned termination of a substantial number of third
party distributor relationships in connection with the Company's realignment of its worldwide publishing business to leverage its existing sales and marketing organizations and improve the control and
management of its products. These actions resulted in an increase in the allowance for sales returns of $11.7 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.4 million. The plan
also included a severance charge of $1.2 million for employee redundancies.

The
components of the charge included in cost of salesâ€”royalties and software amortization and product development represent costs to write down certain assets associated
with exiting certain product lines and re-evaluating other product lines which resulted in reduced expectations.

During
fiscal 2001, the Company completed the restructuring initiatives associated with the fiscal 2000 restructuring plan without any significant adjustments.

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2000 increased 31% from the same period last year, from $436.5 million to $572.2 million. The
increase was due to a 53% increase in console net revenues from $268.2 million to $410.3 million, slightly offset by a 4% decrease in PC net revenues from


$168.3 million to $161.9 million. Domestic net revenues grew 89% from $149.7 million to $282.8 million. International net revenues remained fairly constant, increasing 1%
from $286.8 million to $289.4 million.

Publishing
net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2000 increased 93% from $205.5 million to $396.7 million. This increase primarily was due to publishing
console net revenues increasing 152% from $111.7 million to $281.2 million. The increase in publishing console net revenues was attributable to the release in fiscal 2000 of a larger
number of titles that sold well in the marketplace, including Blue Stinger (Dreamcast), Space Invaders (PlayStation, N64 and Gameboy Color) and Toy Story II (PlayStation and N64), Tarzan (N64 and
Gameboy), A Bug's Life (N64), Vigilante 8: Second Offense (PlayStation, N64 and Gameboy), WuTang: Shaolin Style (PlayStation) and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (PlayStation, N64 and Gameboy). Publishing PC
net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2000 increased 23% from $93.9 million to $115.5 million. This increase primarily was due to the release of Quake 3 Arena, Cabela's Big
Game Hunter III, Star Trek: Hidden Evil, Armada and Soldier of Fortune.

For
the year ended March 31, 2000, distribution net revenues decreased 24% from prior fiscal year from $231.0 million to $175.5 million. The decrease was mainly
attributable to the pricing reductions initiated by leading retail chains in the United Kingdom (the "UK"), which in turn reduced market share for the independent retail channel in the UK to which the
Company's CentreSoft subsidiary is the sole authorized Sony PlayStation distributor, as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation rates.

Net
OEM licensing, on-line and other revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000 increased 40% from $19.0 million to $26.7 million. The increase
was primarily due to an increase in licensing revenues, partially offset by a decrease in OEM revenues. Licensing revenues increased due to an increase in the number of licensing arrangements entered
into by the Company during fiscal 2000. OEM revenues decreased due to the radical changes being experienced in the OEM market in fiscal 2000, which resulted from declining prices of personal computers
and hardware accessories and the reluctance of hardware manufacturers to produce large inventories.

Costs and Expenses

Cost of salesâ€”product costs represented 56% and 60% of net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease
in cost of salesâ€”product costs as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2000 was due to the decrease in distribution net revenue, partially offset by a higher
publishing console net revenue mix. Distribution products have a higher per unit product cost than publishing products, and console products have a higher per unit product cost than PC products.

Cost
of salesâ€”royalty and software amortization expense represented 16% and 9% of net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The
increase in cost of salesâ€”royalty and software amortization expense as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to changes in the Company's product mix, with an increase in the
number of branded products with higher royalty obligations as compared to the prior fiscal year and increases in amortization expenses relating to the release of a greater number of products with
capitalizable development costs. The increase also partially resulted from $11.9 million of write-offs recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 relating to the Company's
restructuring plan as previously described.

Product
development expenses for the year ended March 31, 2000 increased 15% from the same period last year from $22.9 million to $26.3 million. The increase was
primarily due to a $4.2 million charge to product development costs relating to the Company's restructuring plan as previously described.


As a percentage of net revenues, total product creation costs (i.e., royalties and software amortization expense plus product development expenses) increased from 14% to 21% for the
year ended March 31, 2000. Such increases were attributable to the increases in product development costs, as described above.

Sales
and marketing expenses for the year ended March 31, 2000 increased 31% from the same period last year, from $66.4 million to $87.3 million, but remained
relatively constant as a percentage of net revenues at 15% at March 31, 2000 and 1999. The increase in the amount of sales and marketing expenses primarily was due to an increase in the number
of titles released and an increase in television advertising during the final quarter of fiscal 2000 to support the Company's premium titles.

General
and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2000 increased 67% from the prior fiscal year, from $21.9 million to $36.7 million. As a
percentage of net revenues, general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at approximately 5% to 6%. The increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses was due to an
increase in worldwide administrative support needs and headcount related expenses and charges incurred in conjunction with the Company's restructuring plan previously described.

Amortization
of intangibles increased substantially from $1.6 million in fiscal 1999 to $41.6 million in fiscal 2000. This was due to the write-off of
goodwill acquired in purchase acquisitions.

Operating income (loss) for the year ended March 31, 2000, was $(30.3) million, compared to $26.7 million in fiscal 1999.

Publishing
operating income (loss) for the year ended March 31, 2000 decreased 382% to $(35.0) million, compared to $12.4 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease
reflects the charges incurred in conjunction with the Company's restructuring plan as previously described, which predominantly impacted the Company's publishing segment. Distribution operating income
for the year ended March 31, 2000 decreased 67% to $4.7 million, compared to $14.3 million in the prior fiscal year. The period over period change primarily was due to a decrease
in distribution sales and the UK price reductions, as noted earlier.

Other Income (Expense)

Interest expense, net of interest income, increased to $8.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2000, from $3.0 million for the year
ended March 31, 1999. This increase primarily was the result of interest
costs associated with the Company's $125 million term loan and revolving credit facility obtained in June 1999.

Provision for Income Taxes

The income tax benefit of $4.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2000 reflected the Company's effective income tax rate of approximately 12%.
The significant items that generated the variance between the Company's effective rate and its statutory rate of 34% were nondeductible goodwill amortization and an increase in the Company's deferred
tax asset valuation allowance, partially offset by research and development tax credits. The realization of deferred tax assets primarily is dependent on the generation of future taxable income.
Management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate taxable income sufficient to realize the benefit of net deferred tax assets recognized.


Quarterly Operating Results

The Company's quarterly operating results have in the past varied significantly and will likely vary significantly in the future, depending on numerous
factors, several of which are not under the Company's control.  See Item 1 "Businessâ€”Factors Affecting Future Performance" and Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsâ€”Strategic Restructuring Plan." The Company's business also has experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant
seasonality, in part due to consumer buying patterns. Net revenues typically are significantly higher during the fourth calendar quarter, primarily due to the increased demand for consumer software
during the year-end holiday buying season. Accordingly, the Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily
meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.

following table is a comparative breakdown of the Company's quarterly results for the immediately preceding eight quarters (amounts in thousands, except per share data):

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's cash and cash equivalents increased $75.6 million, from $50.0 million at March 31, 2000 to $125.6 million at
March 31, 2001. This was in comparison to a $17.0 million increase in cash flows in fiscal year 2000 from $33.0 million at March 31, 1999 to $50.0 million at
March 31, 2000. This increase in cash in fiscal year 2001 resulted from $81.6 million and $2.5 million provided by operating activities and financing activities, respectively,
offset by $8.6 million utilized in investing activities. The cash provided by operating activities primarily was the result of changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable, driven by a
seasonal change in working capital needs. The cash used in investing activities primarily is the result of capital expenditures. The cash provided by financing activities is primarily the result of
$33.6 million of cash proceeds from the issuance common stock pursuant to employee stock option plans, the employee stock purchase plan and warrants. These inflows were partially offset by
$16.1 in net cash payments on borrowings, as well as $15.0 million of cash used by the Company to purchase its common stock under its repurchase program.

In
connection with the Company's purchases of Nintendo N64 hardware and software cartridges for distribution in North America and Europe, Nintendo requires the Company to provide
irrevocable letters of credit prior to accepting purchase orders from the Company. Furthermore, Nintendo maintains a policy of not accepting returns of Nintendo N64 hardware and software cartridges.
Because of these and other factors, the carrying of an inventory of Nintendo N64 hardware and software cartridges entails significant capital and risk. As of March 31, 2001, the Company had
$5.4 million of N64 hardware and software cartridge inventory on hand, which represented approximately 12% of all inventory.

In
December 1997, the Company completed the private placement of $60.0 million principal amount of 6


/


% convertible subordinated notes due 2005 (the
"Notes"). The Notes are convertible, in


whole or in part, at the option of the holder at any time after December 22, 1997 (the date of original issuance) and prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding
the maturity date, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into common stock, $.000001 par value, of the Company, at a conversion price of $18.875 per share, (equivalent to a conversion rate of
52.9801 shares
per $1,000 principal amount of Notes), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time on or after
January 10, 2001. If redemption occurs prior to December 31, 2003, the Company must pay a premium on such redeemed Notes. Subsequent to March 31, 2001, the Company called for the
redemption of the Notes. In connection with that call, as of June 20, 2001, holders have converted for common stock approximately $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of their
convertible subordinated notes.

The
Company has a $100.0 million revolving credit facility and a $25.0 million term loan with a syndicate of banks (the "U.S. Facility"). The revolving portion of the
U.S. Facility provides the Company with the ability to borrow up to $100.0 million and issue letters of credit up to $80 million on a revolving basis against eligible accounts receivable
and inventory. The $25.0 million term loan portion of the U.S. Facility was used to fund the acquisition of Expert Software, Inc. in June 1999 and to pay costs related to such
acquisition and the securing of the U.S. Facility. The term loan has a three year term with principal amortization on a straight-line quarterly basis beginning December 31, 1999 and
a borrowing rate based on the banks' base rate (which is generally equivalent to the published prime rate) plus 2% or LIBOR plus 3%. The revolving portion of the U.S Facility has a borrowing rate
based on the banks' base rate plus 1.75% or LIBOR plus 2.75% and matures June 2002. The U.S. Facility had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 9.70% for the year ending
March 31, 2001. The Company pays a commitment fee of


/


% on the unused portion of the revolving line. The U.S. Facility is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of
the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries. The U.S. Facility contains various covenants which limit the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions,
create certain liens, sell assets, or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions. The Company is also required to maintain specified financial ratios related to net worth and fixed charges. As of
March 31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. As of March 31, 2001, approximately $8.5 million was outstanding under the term loan portion of the U.S.
Facility. As of March 31, 2001, there were no borrowings outstanding and $18.2 million letters of credit outstanding against the revolving portion of the U.S. Facility.

In
May 2001, the Company repaid the remaining $8.5 million balance of the term loan portion of the U.S. Facility. In conjunction with the accelerated repayment of the
term loan, the Company amended the U.S. Facility effective May 7, 2001. The amended and restated U.S. Facility eliminates the term loan, reduces the revolvers to $78.0 million, reduces
the interest rate to Prime plus 1.25% or LIBOR plus 2.25%, eliminates certain covenants, increases the advance rates and reduces the fee paid for maintenance of the facility.

The
Company has a revolving credit facility through its CD Contact subsidiary in the Netherlands (the "Netherlands Facility"). The Netherlands Facility permits revolving credit loans
and letters of credit up to Netherlands Guilder ("NLG") 26 million ($10 million) at March 31, 2001, based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances. The Netherlands
Facility is due on demand, bears interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus 1.50% (weighted average interest rate of 7.40% as of March 31, 2001) and matures August 2003. The Company had
$1.8 million of borrowings outstanding under the Netherlands Facility at March 31, 2001. There were no letters of credit under the Netherlands Facility as of March 31, 2001.

The
Company also has revolving credit facilities with its CentreSoft subsidiary located in the United Kingdom, (the "UK Facility") and its NBG subsidiary located in Germany, (the
"German Facility").
The UK Facility can be used for working capital requirements and provides for British Pounds ("GBP") 7 million ($10.0 million) of revolving loans and GBP 3 million
($4.3 million) of letters of credit, bears interest at LIBOR plus 2%, is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the


subsidiary and matures in July 2001. The UK Facility also contains various covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios related to, among others, fixed charges.
The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of March 31, 2001. No borrowings were outstanding against the UK Facility at March 31, 2001. Letters of credit of GBP
3.0 million ($4.3 million) were outstanding against the UK Facility at March 31, 2001. The German Facility can be used for working capital requirements and provides for revolving
loans up to Deutsche Marks ("DM") 4 million ($1.8 million), bears interest at 7.0%, is collateralized by a cash deposit of approximately GBP 650,000 ($928,000) made by the Company's
CentreSoft subsidiary and has no expiration date. No borrowings were outstanding against the German Facility as of March 31, 2001.

In
the normal course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements with third parties for the development of products. Under these agreements, the Company commits to
provide specified payments to a developer, contingent upon the developer's achievement of contractually specified milestones. Assuming all contractually specified milestones are achieved, for
contracts in place as of March 31, 2001, the total future minimum contract commitment is approximately $62.1 million, which is scheduled to be paid as follows (amounts in thousands):

Year ending March 31,

35,197


13,528


6,250


2,925


1,675

Thereafter

$

62,075

Additionally,
as of March 31, 2001, under the terms of a production financing arrangement, the Company has a commitment to purchase two future PlayStation 2 titles from
independent third party
developers for an estimated $5.7 million. Failure by the developers to complete the project within the contractual time frame or specifications alleviates the Company's commitment.

The
Company historically has financed its acquisitions through the issuance of shares of its common stock. The Company will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates as to
the benefit they bring to the Company and as to the ability of the Company to make such acquisitions and maintain compliance with its bank facilities.

In
May 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $15.0 million in shares of its common stock as well as its convertible subordinated notes.
The shares and notes could be purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at such times and in such amounts as management deemed appropriate, depending on market conditions
and other factors. During fiscal 2001, the Company repurchased 2.3 million shares of its common stock for approximately $15.0 million.

The
Company believes that it has sufficient working capital ($183.0 million at March 31, 2001), as well as proceeds available from the U.S. Facility, the UK Facility,
the Netherlands Facility and the German Facility, to finance the Company's operational requirements for at least the next twelve months, including acquisitions of inventory and equipment, the funding
of the development, production, marketing and sale of new products, the acquisition of intellectual property rights for future products from third parties and the repurchase of common stock and notes
under the Company's repurchase plan.


Inflation

The Company's management currently believes that inflation has not had a material impact on continuing operations.

Euro Conversion

On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European Union adopted the "euro" as their common currency. The sovereign currencies
of the participating countries are scheduled to remain legal tender as denominations of the euro between January 1, 1999 and January 1, 2002. Beginning January 1, 2002, the
participating countries will issue new euro-denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions. No later than July 1, 2002, the participating countries will withdraw all bills
and coins denominated in the sovereign currencies, so that the sovereign currencies no longer will be
legal tender for any transactions, making conversion to the euro complete. The Company has performed an internal analysis of the possible implications of the euro conversion on the Company's business
and financial condition, and has determined that the impact of the conversion will be immaterial to its overall operations. The Company's wholly owned subsidiaries operating in participating countries
represented 8% and 12% of the Company's consolidated net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Implementation of SAB 101

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, in
December 1999. The SAB summarizes certain of the SEC staff's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. During the year ended
March 31, 2001, the Company performed a review of its revenue recognition policies and determined that it is in compliance with SAB 101.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," ("SFAS No. 133") as
subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138, is effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure
those instruments at fair value. The Company does not currently participate in hedging activities or own derivative instruments but plans to adopt SFAS No. 133 beginning April 1, 2001.
Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 133 will have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices. The Company's market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's market risk sensitive instruments are classified as "other than trading." The Company's exposure to market risk as discussed below
includes "forward-looking statements" and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or
foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may
occur, since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and the timing of transactions.


Interest Rate Risk

The Company has a number of variable rate and fixed rate debt obligations, denominated both in U.S. dollars and various foreign currencies as detailed in
Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The Company manages interest rate risk by monitoring its ratio of fixed and variable rate debt
obligations in view of changing market conditions. Additionally, in the future, the Company may consider the use of interest rate swap agreements to further manage potential interest rate risk.

As
of March 31, 2001, the carrying value of the Company's variable rate debt was $10.3 million, which includes the U.S. Facility ($8.5 million) and the
Netherlands Facility ($1.8 million). As of March 31, 2000, the carrying value of the Company's variable rate debt was $26.0 million, which included the U.S. Facility
($22.5 million) and the Netherlands Facility ($3.5 million). A hypothetical 1% increase in the applicable interest rates of the Company's variable rate debt would increase annual
interest expense by approximately $103,000 and $260,000, as March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The
Company additionally has 6


/


% convertible subordinated notes due 2005 (the "Notes") that have a carrying value of $60.0 million as of March 31, 2001
and 2000. The Notes have a fair value of $60.0 million and $51.6 million as of March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The fair value of the Notes was determined based on quoted
market prices. A hypothetical 1% increase in market rates would decrease their fair value by approximately $600,000 and $516,000 as of March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Subsequent
to March 31, 2001, the Company's holdings of market risk sensitive instruments changed. Subsequent to March 31, 2001, the Company called for the redemption of
$60.0 million of the Notes. In connection with that call, as of June 20, 2001, holders have converted to common stock approximately $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of
their Notes. Additionally, in May 2001, the Company repaid in full the remaining $8.5 million balance of the term loan portion of the U.S. Facility.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The Company transacts business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, particularly GBP. The volatility of GBP (and all other applicable currencies) will be monitored frequently throughout the coming year. While the Company has not traditionally engaged
in foreign currency hedging, the Company may in the future use hedging programs, currency forward contracts, currency options and/or
other derivative financial instruments commonly utilized to reduce financial market risks if it is determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk.

Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

The Company replaced KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as its principal accountant, effective March 20, 2001. The action was recommended by the Company's Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors and was approved by the Company's Board of Directors.

KPMG's
reports on the Company's financial statements for the past two years did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the Company's two most recently completed fiscal years and any subsequent interim period preceding the decision not to renew KPMG,
(i) there were no disagreements with KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practice, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the
satisfaction of KPMG, would have caused it to make a reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report, and (ii) there were no reportable events as described in
Item 304 of Regulation S-K.

The
Company engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers") as the Company's principal accountant to audit the Company's financial statements, effective as of
March 20, 2001. During the Company's two most recent fiscal years and three subsequent interim periods prior to engaging PricewaterhouseCoopers, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf
consulted with PricewaterhouseCoopers regarding the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered
on the Company's financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers that was an important factor considered by the Company in
reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders:

In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2001 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Activision, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at March 31, 2001, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about

provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Activision, Inc. ("Activision" or the "Company") is a leading international publisher, developer and distributor of interactive entertainment and
leisure products. The Company currently focuses its publishing, development and distribution efforts on products designed for personal computers ("PCs") as well as the Sony PlayStation ("PSX") and
PlayStation 2 ("PS2") and Nintendo N64 ("N64") console systems and Nintendo Game Boy handheld game devices. The Company is also currently focusing on the development of products for Microsoft Xbox
("Xbox") and Nintendo GameCube console systems and Nintendo Game Boy Advance hand held device. During January 2001, Sega Corp., the maker of the Sega Dreamcast ("Dreamcast") announced that it
would stop making the Dreamcast in March 2001. Net revenues from the Dreamcast have historically represented only a small percentage of the Company's total net revenues. Accordingly, the
Company believes that the departure of the Dreamcast console system from the market will not have a material impact upon its financial position or results of operations.

The
Company maintains operations in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Australia, Belgium and the Netherlands. For fiscal year 2001, international
operations contributed approximately 43% of net revenues.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Activision, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the "Company"
or "Activision"). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the poolings of interests of the Company with JCM Productions, Inc.
dba Neversoft Entertainment ("Neversoft") in September 1999.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash, money markets and short-term investments with original maturities of not more than 90 days.

The
Company's cash and cash equivalents were comprised of the following at March 31, 2001 and 2000 (amounts in thousands):

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments and accounts
receivable. The Company places its temporary cash investments with financial institutions. At various times during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had deposits in
excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") limit at these financial institutions. The Company's customer base includes retail outlets and distributors including consumer electronics
and computer specialty stores, discount chains, video rental stores and toy stores in the United States and countries worldwide. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
maintains allowances for potential credit losses. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security from its customers.

As
of and for the year ending March 31, 2001, the Company's publishing business had one customer that accounted for 10% of its consolidated net revenues and 15% of its
consolidated accounts receivable, net. For the years ending March 31, 2000 and 1999, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net revenues.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by the Company using available market information and valuation methodologies described
below. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein may not be indicative of the amounts
that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities

: The carrying amounts of these instruments
approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.

Long-term debt and convertible subordinated notes:

The carrying amounts of the Company's variable rate debt
approximate fair value because the interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates. The fair value of the Company's fixed rate debt is based on quoted market prices,
where available, or discounted future cash flows based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of the balance sheet date. The carrying
amount and fair value of the Company's long-term debt and convertible subordinated notes, was $73.6 million and $60.0 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2001 and
$90.0 million and $81.6 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2000.

Prepaid Royalties and Capitalized Software Costs

Prepaid royalties include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements and license fees paid to intellectual property rights
holders for use of their trademarks or copyrights. Intellectual property rights which have alternative future uses are capitalized. Capitalized software costs represent costs incurred for development
that are not recoupable against future royalties.

The
Company accounts for prepaid royalties relating to development agreements and capitalized software costs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed." Software development costs and prepaid royalties are capitalized once technological
feasibility is established. Technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis. For products where proven game engine technology exists, this may occur early in the development
cycle. Software development costs are expensed if and when they are deemed unrecoverable. Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to product
development expense.

Fâ€“8

The following criteria is used to evaluate recoverability of software development costs: historical performance of comparable products; the commercial acceptance of prior products
released on a given game engine; orders for the product prior to its release; estimated performance of a sequel product based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based; and actual
development costs of a product as compared to the Company's budgeted amount.

Commencing
upon product release prepaid royalties and capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of salesâ€”royalties and software amortization on the
ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues, generally resulting in an amortization period of one year or less. For products that have been released, management evaluates the future
recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.

As
of March 31, 2001, prepaid royalties and unamortized capitalized software costs totaled $38.3 million (including $14.7 million classified as
non-current) and $3.9 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2000, prepaid royalties and unamortized capitalized software costs totaled $29.2 million (including
$9.2 million classified as non-current) and $11.6 million, respectively. Amortization of prepaid royalties and capitalized software costs was $68.9 million,
$78.7 million and $27.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.

Revenue Recognition

Product Sales: The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products once they are shipped and are available for general release to customers. Subject
to certain limitations, the Company permits customers to obtain exchanges or return products within certain specified periods and provides price protection on certain unsold merchandise. Management of
the Company estimates the amount of future returns, and price protections based upon historical results and current known circumstances. Revenue from product sales is reflected net of the allowance
for returns and price protection.

Software
Licenses: For those license agreements which provide the customers the right to multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenue is recognized at delivery. Per
copy royalties on sales which exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned.

Advertising Expenses

The Company expenses advertising and the related costs as incurred. Advertising expenses for the years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were
approximately $16.5 million, $18.6 million and $15.6 million, respectively, and are included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets

Cost in excess of the fair value of net assets of companies acquired, goodwill, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging
from 5 to 20 years. As of March 31, 2001 and 2000, accumulated amortization amounted to $51.9 million and $50.8 million, respectively. The Company accounts for impairment
of long-lived assets, including goodwill, in accordance with SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be
Disposed Of." This Statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles, including goodwill, be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to
undiscounted cash flows expected to be

Fâ€“9

generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets. In
conjunction with its strategic restructuring plan as detailed in Note 3, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company recorded a charge for impairment of goodwill of $37.2 million.
See Note 3 for further discussion.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under SFAS No. 109, income taxes are accounted for under
the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currencies of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are their local currencies. All assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries
are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period, and revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates during the period. The resulting
translation adjustments are reflected as a component of shareholders' equity.

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for all periods. Diluted earnings per
share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and common stock equivalents from outstanding stock options and warrants and convertible debt. Common stock
equivalents are calculated using the treasury stock method and represent incremental shares issuable upon exercise of the Company's outstanding options and warrants and conversion of the Company's
convertible debt. However, potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per

Fâ€“10

share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which the Company records a net loss.

Stock Based Compensation

Prior to April 1, 1996, the Company accounted for its stock option plan in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB No. 25"), and related interpretations. As such, compensation expense would be recorded on the date of the grant only if the
current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the option exercise price. On April 1, 1996 the Company adopted SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which
permits entities to recognize as expense over the vesting period, the fair value of all stock-based awards on the date of the grant. Alternatively, SFAS No. 123 also allows entities to continue
to apply the provisions of APB No. 25 and provide pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants made in 1995 and future years as if the
fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied. The Company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB No. 25 and provide the pro forma
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123.

Warrants
granted to non-employees are accounted for in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 96-18 "Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued To Other Than Employees for Acquiring or in Connection With Selling Goods or Services" (EITF 96-18).

Related Parties

As of March 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had $4.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively, of loans outstanding due from employees. The
loans bear interest at 6.75% and are primarily due from Company executives.

Implementation of SAB 101

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, in
December 1999. The SAB summarizes certain of the SEC staff's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. During the year ended
March 31, 2001, the Company performed a review of its revenue recognition policies and determined that it is in compliance with SAB 101.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," ("SFAS No. 133") as
subsequently amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138, is
effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. It
requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. The Company does not currently
participate in hedging activities or own derivative instruments but plans to adopt SFAS No. 133 beginning April 1, 2001. Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 133
will have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation. These reclassifications had no
effect on net income (loss), shareholders' equity or net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents.

On June 29,1999, the Company acquired Elsinore Multimedia, Inc. ("Elsinore"), a privately held interactive software development company, in
exchange for 204,448 shares of the Company's common stock.

The
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of Elsinore have been included in the Company's consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition. The aggregate purchase price has been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired, consisting mostly of goodwill of $3.0 million, that is
being amortized over a five year period. Pro forma statements of operations reflecting the acquisition of Elsinore are not shown, as they would not differ materially from reported results.

Acquisition of Expert Software

On June 22, 1999, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Expert Software, Inc. ("Expert"), a publicly held developer and
publisher of value-line interactive leisure products, for approximately $24.7 million. The aggregate purchase price of approximately $24.7 million consisted of
$20.3 million in cash payable to the former shareholders of Expert, the valuation of employee stock options in the amount of $3.3 million, and other acquisition costs.

The
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of Expert have been included in the Company's consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition.

However,
as more fully described in Note 3, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company implemented a strategic restructuring plan to accelerate the development of games
for the next-generation consoles and the Internet. In conjunction with that plan, the Company consolidated Expert and its Head Games subsidiary, forming one integrated business unit in the
value software category. As part of this consolidation, the Company discontinued several of Expert's product lines and terminated substantially all of Expert's employees. In addition, the Company
phased out the use of the Expert name. As a result of these initiatives, in fiscal 2000, the Company incurred a nonrecurring charge of $26.3 million resulting from the write-down of
intangibles acquired, including goodwill.

Fiscal 1999 Transactions

The acquisitions of Head Games and CD Contact were originally treated as immaterial poolings of interests. However, after reviewing the results of operations
of the entities, including the materiality and impact on the Company's trends, in fiscal 1999 the Company restated the financial statements for all periods prior to the closing of each respective
transaction.

Acquisition of Head Games

On June 30, 1998, the Company acquired Head Games in exchange for 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The acquisition was accounted for as a
pooling of interests.

Acquisition of CD Contact

On September 29, 1998, the Company acquired CD Contact in exchange for 1,900,000 shares of the Company's common stock and the assumption of
$9.1 million in outstanding debt payable to CD Contact's former shareholders. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests.

Strategic Restructuring Plan

In
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company finalized a strategic restructuring plan to accelerate the development and sale of interactive entertainment and leisure products for
the next-generation consoles and the Internet. Costs associated with this plan amounted to $70.2 million, approximately $61.8 million net of taxes, and were recorded in the
consolidated statement of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000 and classified as follows (amount in millions):

Net revenues

$

11.9

Product development

4.2

General and administrative

5.2

Amortization of intangible assets

37.2

$

70.2

Fâ€“13

The
component of the charge included in amortization of intangible assets represented a write down of intangibles including goodwill, relating to Expert Software, Inc.
("Expert"), one of the Company's value publishing subsidiaries, totaling $26.3 million. The Company consolidated Expert into Head Games, forming one integrated business unit. As part of this
consolidation, the Company discontinued substantially all of Expert's product lines, terminated substantially all of Expert's employees and phased out the use of the Expert name. In addition, a
$10.9 million write down of goodwill relating to TDC, an OEM business unit, was recorded. In fiscal 2000, the OEM market went through radical changes due to price declines of PCs and hardware
accessories. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flow of these assets was not sufficient to cover the carrying value of these assets and as such was written down to fair market value.

The
component of the charge included in net revenues and general and administrative expense represents costs associated with the planned termination of a substantial number of its
third party distributor relationships in connection with the Company's realignment of its worldwide publishing business to leverage its existing sales and marketing organizations and improve the
control and management of its products. These actions resulted in an increase in the allowance for sales returns of
$11.7 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.4 million. The plan also included a severance charge of $1.2 million for employee redundancies.

The
components of the charge included in cost of salesâ€”royalties and software amortization and product development represent costs to write down certain assets associated
with exiting certain product lines and re-evaluating other product lines which resulted in reduced expectations.

During
fiscal 2001, the Company completed the restructuring initiatives associated with the fiscal 2000 restructuring plan without any significant adjustments.

Operations by Reportable Segments and Geographic Area

The
Company publishes, develops and distributes interactive entertainment and leisure products for a variety of game platforms, including PCs, the Sony PlayStation and PlayStation 2
console systems, the Nintendo 64 console system, the Nintendo Game Boy and the Sega Dreamcast console system. The Company has also begun product development for next-generation console
systems and hand held devices, including Microsoft's Xbox and Nintendo's GameCube and Game Boy Advance. Based on its organizational structure, the Company operates in two reportable segments:
publishing and distribution.

The
Company's publishing segment publishes titles that are developed both internally through the studios owned by the Company and externally through third party developers. In the
United States, the Company's products are sold primarily on a direct basis to major computer and software retailing organizations, mass market retailers, consumer electronic stores, discount
warehouses and mail order companies. The Company conducts its international publishing activities through offices in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Australia, Canada and Japan. The Company's
products are sold
internationally on a direct to retail basis and through third party distribution and licensing arrangements and through the Company's wholly-owned distribution subsidiaries located in the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany.

Fâ€“15

The Company's distribution segment, located in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany, distributes interactive entertainment software and hardware and provides logistical
services for a variety of publishers and manufacturers.

The
President and Chief Operating Officer allocates resources to each of these segments using information on their respective revenues and operating profits before interest and taxes.
The President and Chief Operating Officer has been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information," ("SFAS No. 131").

The
President and Chief Operating Officer does not evaluate individual segments based on assets or depreciation.

The
accounting policies of these segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Revenue derived from sales between segments is eliminated
in consolidation.

included in the calculations of diluted earnings (loss) per share because their effect would be antidilutive. Convertible subordinated
notes were also not included in the calculations of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be antidilutive.

Subsequent to March 31, 2001, the Company called for the redemption of its $60.0 million convertible subordinated notes due 2005. In connection with that call, holders
have converted into common stock approximately $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of their convertible subordinated notes, resulting in the issuance of approximately 3,175,000 shares of
common stock to such holders.

In
accordance with Statement of Position 90-7 ("SOP 90-7"), "Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code," issued by the AICPA,
benefits from loss carryforwards arising prior to the Company's reorganization are recorded as additional paid-in capital. During the year ended March 31, 2001, $3.7 million
was recorded as additional paid-in capital.

As
of March 31, 2001, the Company's available federal net operating loss carryforward of $30.8 million is subject to certain limitations as defined under
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2006 to 2019. The Company's available state

Fâ€“19

net operating loss carryforward of $8.0 million is not subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has tax credit carryforwards of
$9.4 million and $4.8 million for federal and state purposes, respectively, which expire from 2006 to 2021.

At
March 31, 2001, the Company's deferred income tax asset for tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards was reduced by a valuation allowance of
$9.9 million. Of such valuation allowance, none relates to SOP 90-7 which, if realized, would be recorded as additional paid-in capital. Realization of the deferred tax
assets is dependent upon the continued generation of sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of tax credits and loss carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is
more likely than not that the net carrying value of the deferred tax asset will be realized. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the future if
estimates of future taxable income are reduced.

Cumulative
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided approximated $22.8 million at March 31, 2001. Deferred income
taxes on these earnings have not been provided as these amounts are considered to be permanent in duration.

In
June 1999, the Company obtained a $100.0 million revolving credit facility and a $25.0 million term loan (the "U.S. Facility") with a syndicate of banks. The
revolving portion of the U.S. Facility provides the Company with the ability to borrow up to $100.0 million and issue letters of credit up to $80 million on a revolving basis against
eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The $25.0 million term loan portion of the U.S. Facility was used to acquire Expert Software, Inc. in June 1999 and to pay costs
related to such acquisition and the securing of the U.S. Facility. The term loan has a three year term with principal amortization on a straight-line quarterly basis beginning
December 31, 1999 and a borrowing rate based on the banks' base rate (which is generally equivalent to the published prime rate) plus 2% or LIBOR plus 3%. The revolving portion of the U.S
Facility has a borrowing rate based on the banks' base rate plus 1.75% or LIBOR plus 2.75% and matures June 2002. The U.S. Facility had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 9.70%
and 9.50% for the year ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company pays a commitment fee of


/


% on the unused portion of the revolving line. The U.S. Facility is
collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries. The U.S. Facility contains various covenants that limit the ability of the Company to incur additional
indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions, create certain liens, sell assets, or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions. The Company is also required to maintain specified financial
ratios related to net worth and fixed charges. As of March 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. As of March 31, 2001, approximately $8.5 million
was
outstanding under the term loan portion of the U.S. Facility. As of March 31, 2001, there were no borrowings outstanding and $18.2 million of letters of credit outstanding against the

Fâ€“20

revolving portion of the U.S. Facility. As of March 31, 2000, $20.0 million was outstanding under the term loan portion and $2.5 million was outstanding under the revolving
portion of the U.S. Facility. No letters of credit were outstanding against the revolving portion of the U.S. Facility at March 31, 2000.

The
Company has a revolving credit facility through its CD Contact subsidiary in the Netherlands (the "Netherlands Facility"). The Netherlands Facility permits revolving credit loans
and letters of credit up to Netherlands Guilders ("NLG") 26 million ($10.4 million) as of March 31, 2001 and NLG 45 million ($19.4 million) as of March 31,
2000, based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances. The Netherlands Facility is due on demand, bears interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus 1.50% and 1.25% in fiscal 2001 and 2000,
respectively (weighted average interest rate of approximately 7.40% and 6.80% as of March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively) and matures August 2003. Borrowings outstanding under the
Netherlands Facility were $1.8 million and $3.5 million at March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Letters of credit outstanding under the Netherlands Facility were NLG
3.8 million ($1.6 million) as of March 31, 2000. There were no letters of credit outstanding under the Netherlands Facility as of March 31, 2001.

The
Company also has revolving credit facilities with its CentreSoft subsidiary located in the United Kingdom (the "UK Facility") and its NBG subsidiary located in Germany (the
"German Facility"). The UK Facility provides for British Pounds ("GBP") 7.0 million ($10.0 million) of revolving loans and GBP 3.0 million ($4.3 million) of letters of
credit as of March 31, 2001 and GBP 7.0 million ($11.2 million) of revolving loans and GBP 6.0 million ($9.6 million) of letters of credit as of March 31,
2000. The UK Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 2%, is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and matures in July 2001. The UK Facility also contains various
covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios related to, among others, fixed charges. As of March 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company was in compliance with these
covenants. No borrowings were outstanding against the UK facility at March 31, 2001 or 2000. Letters of credit of GBP 3.0 million ($4.3 million) and GBP 6.0 million
($9.6 million) were outstanding against the UK Facility at March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of March 31, 2001 and 2000, the German Facility provides for revolving loans
up to Deutsche Marks ("DM") 4 million ($1.8 million), bears interest at 7.0%, is collateralized by a cash deposit of approximately GBP 650,000 ($928,000) made by the Company's CentreSoft
subsidiary and has no expiration date. No borrowings were outstanding against the German Facility as of March 31, 2001 and 2000.

Mortgage
notes payable relate to the land, office and warehouse facilities of the Company's German and Netherlands subsidiaries. The notes bear interest at 5.45% and 5.35%,
respectively, and are collateralized by the related assets. The Netherlands mortgage note payable is due in quarterly installments of NLG 25,000 ($10,000) and matures January 2019. The German
mortgage note payable is due in bi-annual installments of DM 145,000 ($65,500) beginning June 2002 and matures December 2019.

notes due 2005 (the "Notes"). The Notes are convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder at any time after December 22, 1997 (the date of original issuance) and prior to the
close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into common stock, $.000001 par value, of the Company, at a conversion price
of $18.875 per share, (equivalent to a conversion rate of 52.9801 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in
part, at the option of the Company at any time on or after January 10, 2001, subject to premiums through December 31, 2003.

Commitments and Contingencies

Developer Contracts

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements with third parties for the development of products. Under these agreements,
the Company commits to provide specified payments to a developer, contingent upon the developer's achievement of contractually specified milestones. Assuming all contractually specified milestones are
achieved, for contracts in place as of March 31, 2001, the total future minimum contract commitment is approximately $62.1 million, which is scheduled to be paid as follows (amount in

Stock Compensation Plans

Employee Options

The Company sponsors three stock option plans for the benefit of officers, employees, consultants and others.

The
Activision 1991 Stock Option and Stock Award Plan, as amended, (the "1991 Plan") permits the granting of "Awards" in the form of non-qualified stock options, incentive
stock options ("ISOs"), stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock awards, deferred stock awards and other common stock-based awards. The total number of shares of common stock available for
distribution under the 1991 Plan is 7,567,000. The 1991 Plan requires available shares to consist in whole or in part of authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares. There were approximately
229,000 shares remaining available for grant under the 1991 Plan as of March 31, 2001.

On
September 23, 1998, the stockholders of the Company approved the Activision 1998 Incentive Plan (the "1998 Plan"). The 1998 Plan permits the granting of "Awards" in the form
of non-qualified stock options, ISOs, SARS, restricted stock awards, deferred stock awards and other common stock-based awards to directors, officers, employees, consultants and others.
The total number of shares of common stock available for distribution under the 1998 Plan is 3,000,000. The 1998 Plan requires available
shares to consist in whole or in part of authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares. There were approximately 648,000 shares remaining available for grant under the 1998 Plan as of
March 31, 2001.

On,
April 26, 1999, the Board of Directors approved the Activision 1999 Incentive Plan (the "1999 Plan"). The 1999 Plan permits the granting of "Awards" in the form of
non-qualified stock options, ISOs, SARs, restricted stock awards, deferred share awards and other common stock-based awards to directors, officers, employees, consultants and others. The
total number of shares of common stock available for distribution under the 1999 Plan is 5,000,000. The 1999 Plan requires available shares to consist in whole or in part of authorized and unissued
shares or treasury shares. As of March 31, 2001, there were approximately 262,000 shares remaining available for grant under the 1999 Plan.

The
exercise price for Awards issued under the 1991 Plan, 1998 Plan and 1999 Plan (collectively, the "Plans") is determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors (or the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which administers the Plans), and for ISOs, is not to be less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock at the date of grant, or in the
case of non-qualified options, must exceed or be equal to 85% of the fair market value at the date of grant. Options typically become exercisable in installments over a period not to
exceed five years and must be exercised within 10 years of the date of grant. However, certain options granted to executives vest immediately. Historically, stock options have been granted with
exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair market value at the date of grant.

In
connection with current and prior employment agreements between the Company and Robert A. Kotick, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian G. Kelly, the
Company's Co-Chairman, Mr. Kotick and Mr. Kelly have been granted options to purchase common stock.

Fâ€“23

Relating to such grants, as of March 31, 2001, 4,269,000 and 3,186,000 shares with weighted average exercise prices of $8.43 and $9.22 were outstanding and exercisable, respectively.

The
Company also issues stock options in conjunction with acquisition transactions. For the year ended March 31, 2001, approximately 13,000 and 1,000 options with weighted
average exercise prices of $9.74 and $6.76 were outstanding and exercisable, respectively, relating to options issued in conjunction with the acquisitions of Head Games and Expert.

Director Warrants

The Director Warrant Plan, which expired on December 19, 1996, provided for the automatic granting of warrants ("Director Warrants") to purchase 16,667
shares of common stock to each director of the
Company who was not an officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Director Warrants granted under the Director Warrant Plan vest 25% on the first anniversary of the date of grant,
and 12.5% each six months thereafter. The expiration of the Plan had no effect on the outstanding Director Warrants. As of March 31, 2001, there were no shares of common stock available for
distribution under the Director Warrant Plan.

The
range of exercise prices for Director Warrants outstanding as of March 31, 2001 was $.75 to $8.50. The range of exercise prices for Director Warrants is wide due to
increases and decreases in the Company's stock price over the period of the grants. As of March 31, 2001, 28,700 of the outstanding and vested Director Warrants have a weighted average
remaining contractual life of 0.78 years and a weighted average exercise price of $.75; 20,000 of the outstanding and vested Director Warrants have a weighted average remaining contractual life
of 3.82 years and a weighted average exercise price of $6.50; and 20,000 of the outstanding and vested Director Warrants have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.82 years
and a weighted average exercise price of $8.50.

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997, the Company issued warrants to purchase 40,000 shares of the Company's common stock, at exercise prices ranging from $11.80 to
$13.88 to two of its outside directors in connection with their election to the Board. Such warrants have vesting terms identical to the Directors Warrants and expire within 10 years. Relating
to such warrants, as of March 31, 2001, 40,000 and 39,000 shares with weighted average exercise prices of $12.85 and $12.89 were outstanding and exercisable, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees (the "Purchase Plan"). Under the Purchase Plan, shares of the Company's common stock
may be purchased at six-month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or last day of each six-month period (the "Offering Period"). Employees may
purchase shares having a value not exceeding 10% of their gross compensation during an Offering Period. Employees purchased 34,615 and 39,002 shares at a price of $9.46 and $10.68 per share during the
Purchase Plan's offering period ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and 43,910 and 33,440 shares at a price of $11.79 and $10.25 per share during the Purchase Plan's offering
period ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Non-Employee Warrants

In prior years, the Company has granted stock warrants to third parties in connection with the development of software and the acquisition of licensing rights
for intellectual property. The warrants generally vest upon grant and are exercisable over the term of the warrant. The exercise price of third party warrants is generally greater than or equal to the
fair market value of the Company's common stock at the date of grant.

No
such grants were made during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2001. As of March 31, 2001, 1,316,000 third party warrants to purchase common stock were outstanding
with a weighted average exercise price of $10.89 per share.

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000, the Company granted warrants to a third party to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of
$11.63 per share in connection with, and as partial consideration for, a license agreement that allows the Company to utilize the third party's name in conjunction with certain Activision products.
The warrants vested upon grant, have a seven year term and become exercisable ratably in annual installments over the warrant term. As of March 31, 2000, 1,580,000 third party warrants to
purchase common stock were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $11.02 per share.

As
of March 31, 1999, 1,480,000 third party warrants to purchase common stock were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $10.98 per share

The
fair value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model, assuming a risk-free rate of 4.77%, a volatility factor of 66% and expected terms as
noted above. The weighted average estimated fair value of third party warrants granted during the years ending March 31, 2000 and
1999 were $7.89 per share and $7.93 per share, respectively. No warrants were granted during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2001. In accordance EITF 96-18, the Company measures
the fair value of the securities on the measurement date. The fair value of each warrant is capitalized and amortized to royalty expense when the related product is released and the related revenue is
recognized. During fiscal year 2001, 2000 and 1999, $1.4 million, $5.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively, was amortized and included in royalty expense relating to warrants.

Pro Forma Information

The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," in accounting for its employee stock options. Under
APB No. 25, if the exercise price of

Fâ€“26

the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized in the Company's financial statements.

Pro
forma information regarding net income (loss) and earnings per share is required by SFAS No. 123. This information is required to be determined as if the Company had
accounted for its employee stock options (including shares issued under the Purchase Plan and Director Warrant Plan and other employee option grants, collectively called "options") granted during
fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 under the fair value method of that statement. The fair value of options granted in the years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 reported below has been estimated at
the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in the opinion of management, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the
fair value of its options. For options granted during fiscal 2001, the per share weighted average fair value of options with exercise prices equal to market value on date of grant and exercise prices
greater than market value were $3.12, and $1.34, respectively. For options granted during fiscal 2000, the per share weighted average fair value of options with exercise prices equal to market value
on date of grant, exercise prices greater than market value and exercise prices less than market value were $5.91, $2.64 and $8.00, respectively. The weighted average estimated fair value of options
and warrants granted during the year ended March 31, 1999 was $11.12 per share. The per share weighted average estimated fair value of Employee Stock Purchase Plan shares granted during the
years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $3.48, $3.35 and $2.85, respectively.

For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The Company's pro forma information follows

Employee Retirement Plan

The Company has a retirement plan covering substantially all of its eligible employees. The retirement plan is qualified in accordance with
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan, employees may defer up to 15% of their pre-tax salary, but not more than statutory limits.

Fâ€“27

The Company contributes 5% of each dollar contributed by a participant. The Company's matching contributions to the plan were $62,000, $46,000 and $40,000 during the years ended March 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively.

13.

Shareholders Equity

Repurchase Plan

As of May 9, 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $15.0 million in shares of its common stock as well as its
convertible subordinated notes. The shares and notes could be purchased from time to time through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The amount of shares and notes purchased and
the timing of purchases was based on a number of factors, including the market price of the shares and notes, market conditions, and such other factors as the Company's management deemed appropriate.
The Company has financed the purchase of shares with available cash. As of the quarter ending June 30, 2000, the Company had repurchased 2.3 million shares of its common stock for
approximately $15.0 million.

Shareholders' Rights Plan

On April 18, 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a shareholders rights plan (the "Rights Plan"). Under the Rights Plan, each common
stockholder at the close of business on April 19, 2000, will receive a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held. Each right represents the right to purchase one
one-hundredth (1/100) of a share of the Company's Series A Junior Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $40.00. Initially, the rights are represented by the Company's common stock
certificates and are neither exercisable nor traded separately from the Company's common stock. The rights will only become exercisable if a person or group acquires 15% or more of the common stock of
the Company, or announces or commences a tender or exchange offer which would result in the bidder's beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company's common stock.

In
the event that any person or group acquires 15% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock each holder of a right (other than such person or members of such group) will
thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such right, in lieu of shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock, the number of shares of common stock of the Company having a value equal
to two times the then current exercise price of the right. If the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person has acquired 15% or more the Company's common
stock, each holder of a
right will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such right a number of the acquiring company's common shares having a market value equal to two times the then current exercise price
of the right. For persons who, as of the close of business on April 18, 2000, beneficially own 15% or more of the common stock of the Company, the Rights Plan "grandfathers" their current level
of ownership, so long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of certain limitations.

The
Company may redeem the rights for $.01 per right at any time until the first public announcement of the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 15% of the Company's common stock.
At any time after a person has acquired 15% or more (but before any person has acquired more than 50%) of the Company's common stock, the Company may exchange all or part of the rights for shares of
common stock at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock per right. The rights expire on April 18, 2010.

Organizational Structure

Effective June 9, 2000, Activision reorganized into a holding company form of organizational structure, whereby Activision Holdings, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Activision Holdings"), became the holding company for Activision and its subsidiaries. The new holding company organizational structure will allow Activision to manage its
entire organization more effectively and broadens the alternatives for future financings.

The
holding company organizational structure was effected by a merger conducted pursuant to Section 251 (g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
which provides for the formation of a holding company structure without a vote of the stockholders of the constituent corporations. In the merger, ATVI Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
organized for the purpose of implementing the holding company organizational structure, (the "Merger Sub"), merged with and into Activision with Activision as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation"). Prior to the merger, Activision Holdings was a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Activision and Merger Sub was a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Activision Holdings. Pursuant to the
merger, (i) each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Activision (including treasury shares) was converted into one share of common stock of Activision Holdings, (ii) each
issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub was converted into one share of the Surviving Corporation's common stock, and Merger Sub's corporate existence ceased, and (iii) all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Activision Holdings owned by Activision were automatically canceled and retired. As a result of the merger, Activision became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Activision
Holdings.

Immediately
following the merger, Activision changed its name to "Activision Publishing, Inc." and Activision Holdings changed its name to "Activision, Inc." The holding
company's common stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq National Market under the symbol ATVI.

The
conversion of shares of Activision's common stock in the merger occurred without an exchange of certificates. Accordingly, certificates formerly representing shares of outstanding
common stock of Activision are deemed to represent the same number of shares of common stock of Activision Holdings. The change to the holding company structure was tax free for federal income tax
purposes for stockholders.

These
transactions had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

17.

Subsequent Eventsâ€”Unaudited

Subsequent to March 31, 2001, the Company called for the redemption of its $60.0 million convertible subordinated notes due 2005. In connection
with that call, as of June 20, 2001, holders have converted into common stock approximately $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of their convertible subordinated notes.

In
May 2001, the Company repaid in full the remaining $8.5 million balance of the term loan portion of the U.S. Facility. In conjunction with the accelerated repayment
of the term loan, the Company amended the U.S. Facility effective May 7, 2001. The amended and restated U.S. Facility eliminates the term loan, reduces the revolver to $78.0 million,
reduces the interest rate to Prime plus 1.25% or LIBOR plus 2.25%, eliminates certain covenants, increases the advance rates and reduces the fee paid for maintenance of the facility.
