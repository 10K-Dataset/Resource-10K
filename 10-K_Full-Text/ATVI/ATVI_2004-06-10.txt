BUSINESS

(a)

General

Activision, Inc. (“Activision” or “we”) is a
leading international publisher of interactive entertainment software products.  We have built a company with a diverse
portfolio of products that spans a wide range of categories and target markets
and that is used on a variety of game hardware platforms and operating systems.  We have created, licensed and acquired a
group of highly recognizable brands, which we market to a variety of consumer
demographics.  Our fiscal 2004 product
portfolio included such best-selling products as

Tony Hawk’s Underground

,

True
Crime: Streets of L.A.

,

Call of
Duty

and

X2: Wolverine’s Revenge

.

Our products cover game categories such as
action/adventure, action sports, racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person
action and strategy.  Our target
customer base ranges from game enthusiasts and children to mass-market
consumers and “value” buyers.  We
currently offer our products primarily in versions that operate on the Sony
PlayStation 2 (“PS2”), Nintendo GameCube (“GameCube”) and Microsoft Xbox
(“Xbox”) console systems, Nintendo Game Boy Advance (“GBA”) hand-held device
and the personal computer (“PC”).  The
installed base for this current generation of hardware platforms is significant
and growing.  We believe recent price
cuts in calendar 2004 on the Xbox and PS2 hardware should continue to drive the
growth of the installed base of these two platforms.  We also expect the installed base of the other current generation
platforms to continue to grow.  In
addition, Sony announced that it would be entering the hand-held hardware
market with the introduction of its hand-held gaming device, PlayStation
Portable (“PSP”).  PSP is currently
expected to be released in the United States toward the end of the first
quarter of calendar 2005.  Nintendo has
also announced that it plans to launch a new dual-screened, portable game
system, Nintendo Dual Screen (“NDS”), before the end of calendar 2004.  We are currently developing titles for the
PSP and the NDS with the objective of having one or more titles at launch for
each of these platforms.  We are also
planning to develop titles for the next generation console systems expected to
be developed by Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo for release in the next two to
three years.

Our publishing business involves the
development, marketing and sale of products directly, by license or through our
affiliate label program with certain third-party publishers.  Our distribution business consists of
operations in Europe that provide logistical and sales services to third-party
publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations
and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

We were originally incorporated in California
in 1979.  In December 1992, we
reincorporated in Delaware.  In June
2000, we reorganized into the current holding company organizational structure.

In April 2003, the Board of
Directors approved a three-for-two split of our outstanding common shares
effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. 
The split was paid on June 6, 2003 to shareholders of record as of May
16, 2003.  In February 2004, the Board
of Directors approved a second three-for-two split of our outstanding common
shares effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend.  The split was paid on March 15, 2004 to shareholders of record as
of February 23, 2004.  The par value of
our common stock was maintained at the pre-split amount of $.000001.  All share and per share data have been
restated as if the stock splits had occurred as of the earliest period
presented.

(b)

Business Combinations

We have completed a number of acquisitions of
both software development companies and interactive entertainment product
distribution companies.  The interactive
entertainment industry has been consolidating and we intend to continue to
expand our resources through acquisitions, strategic relationships and key
license transactions.  During fiscal
2004, we continued to enhance our internal product development capabilities
with the acquisition of a privately held interactive software development
company, Infinity Ward.  See the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding this and prior
acquisitions.

(c)

Financial Information About Industry
Segments

We have two reportable segments: publishing
and distribution.  Publishing relates to
the development (both internally and externally), marketing and sale of DVD, CD
and cartridge-based interactive entertainment software products owned or
controlled by us directly, by license or through our affiliate label program
with certain third-party


publishers.  Distribution primarily refers to logistical
and sales services provided by our European distribution subsidiaries to
third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own
publishing operations and manufacturers of interactive entertainment
hardware.  See the Consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K for certain financial information required by Item 1.

Narrative Description of Business

Our objective is to be a worldwide leader in
the development, publishing and distribution of quality interactive
entertainment software products that deliver a highly satisfying consumer
entertainment experience.  Our business
strategy, the key components of our business operations and the risk factors
that could impact our business are detailed below.

Strategy

Create, Acquire and Maintain Strong Brands.

We focus development and publishing
activities principally on products that are, or have the potential to become,
franchise properties with sustainable consumer appeal and brand
recognition.  It is our experience that
these products can then serve as the basis for sequels, prequels and related new
products that can be released over an extended period of time. We believe that
the publishing and distribution of products based in large part on franchise
properties enhances predictability of revenues and the probability of high unit
volume sales and operating profits. We have entered into a series of strategic
relationships with the owners of intellectual property pursuant to which we
have acquired the rights to publish products based on franchises such as Marvel
Comics’ properties including Spider-Man, X-MEN, Iron Man and Fantastic Four. We
have additionally entered into exclusive licensing agreements to develop and
publish video games based on the best-selling children’s book series Lemony
Snicket’s “A Series of Unfortunate Events,” which is being developed into a
feature film, as well as for DreamWorks SKG’s recently released “Shrek 2” and
three other Dreamworks SKG upcoming computer-animated films, “Shark Tale”,
“Madagascar” and “Over the Hedge” and their sequels.  We also have a strategic relationship with professional
skateboarder Tony Hawk through an exclusive multi-year agreement to develop
video games using his name and likeness. 
Through fiscal 2004, we have released five successful titles in the Tony
Hawk franchise.  We also have created a
select number of new intellectual properties, such as True Crime: Streets of
L.A. and Call of Duty, that we believe have the potential to join this list of
franchise properties.

Execute Disciplined Product Selection and Development Processes.

The success of our publishing business
depends, in significant part, on our ability to develop high quality games that
will generate high unit volume sales. 
Our publishing units have implemented a formal control process for the
selection, development, production and quality assurance of our products. We
apply this process, which we refer to as the “Greenlight Process,” to all of
our products, whether externally or internally developed. The Greenlight
Process includes in-depth reviews of each project at six important stages of
development by a team that includes many of our highest-ranking operating
managers and coordination between our sales and marketing personnel and
development staff at each step in the process.

We develop our products using a combination
of our internal development resources and external development resources acting
under contract with us.  We are a
capital investor in some of these external developers.  We typically select our external developers
based on their track record and expertise in producing products in the same
category. One developer will often produce the same game for multiple platforms
and will produce sequels to the original game. We believe that selecting and
using development resources, in this manner allows us to strengthen and
leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development
resources, which we believe will add to the quality of our products.

Create and Maintain Diversity in Product Mix, Platforms and Markets.

We believe that maintaining a diversified
mix of products can reduce our operating risks and enhance profitability.
Therefore, we develop and publish products spanning a wide range of product
categories, including action/adventure, action sports, racing, role-playing,
simulation, first-person action and strategy. 
We also develop products designed for target audiences ranging from game
enthusiasts and children to mass-market consumers and “value” buyers.  Presently, we concentrate on developing,
publishing and distributing products that operate on PS2, GameCube and Xbox
console systems, GBA hand-held device and the PC. We typically offer our
products for use on multiple platforms in order to reduce the risks associated
with any single platform, leverage our costs over a larger installed hardware
base and increase unit sales.

Continue to Improve Profitability.

We continually strive to manage risk and
increase our operating leverage and efficiency with the goal of increased
profitability. We believe the key factor affecting our future profitability
will


be the success
rate of our product releases. Therefore, our product selection and development
process includes, as a significant component, periodic evaluations of the
expected commercial success of products under development. Through this process,
for titles that we determine to be less promising, corrections are made in the
development process or, if necessary, they are discontinued before we incur
additional development costs. In addition, we believe our focus on cross
platform releases and branded products will contribute to improved
profitability.

We continue to focus on increasing our
margins. We have, for example, acquired certain experienced and specialized
developers in instances where we can enhance profitability through the
elimination of royalty obligations. 
Additionally, we often rely on independent third-party interactive
entertainment software developers to develop some of our software products,
thereby taking advantage of specialized independent developers without
incurring the fixed overhead obligations associated with increased internally
employed staff.

Our sales and marketing staff work with our
studio resources to increase the visibility of new product launches and to
coordinate the timing and promotion of product releases. Our finance and sales
and marketing personnel work together to improve inventory management and
receivables collections. We have instituted broad objective-based reward
programs that provide incentives to management and staff throughout the
organization to produce results that meet our financial objectives.

Grow Through Continued Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances.

The interactive entertainment industry has
been consolidating, and we believe that success in this industry will be driven
in part by the ability to take advantage of scale. Specifically, smaller
companies are more capital constrained, enjoy less predictability of revenues
and cash flow, lack product diversity and must spread fixed costs over a
smaller revenue base. Several industry leaders are emerging that combine the
entrepreneurial and creative spirit of the industry with professional
management, the ability to access the capital markets and the ability to
maintain favorable relationships with developers, intellectual property owners
and retailers. Through 15 completed acquisitions since 1997, we believe that we
have successfully diversified our operations, our channels of distribution, our
development talent pool and our library of titles, and have emerged as one of
the industry’s leaders. We intend to continue to evaluate the expansion of our
resources through acquisitions, strategic relationships and key license
transactions. We intend to continue expanding our intellectual property library
through key license transactions and strategic relationships with intellectual
property owners and to continue to evaluate opportunities to increase our
development capacity through the acquisition of or investment in selected
experienced software development firms.

Products

Historically we have been best known for our
action/adventure, strategy and simulation products.  With the successful introduction of the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater
brand, we have become a leader in the skateboarding category.  We have also found success in the
superheroes category with our release of titles based on the Spider-Man and
X-MEN properties.  We have also found
recent success in the racing and first person action categories through two
original intellectual properties,

True
Crime:  Streets of L.A.

and

Call of Duty,

both of which we hope to
establish as successful long-term franchises. 
In addition, we have established ourselves as a leader in the “value”
software publishing business with products under our Cabela’s license, as well
as with products distributed on behalf of our “value” affiliate label
partners.  Products published by us in
this category are generally developed by third parties, often under contract
with us, and are marketed under the Activision Value Publishing name.  Value software is typically less sophisticated
and less complex, both in terms of the development process and consumer
gameplay.

Hardware Licenses.

Our products currently are
being developed or published primarily for PS2, Xbox and GameCube console
systems, GBA hand-held device and PCs. 
In order to maintain general access to the console systems and hand-held
device marketplace, we have maintained licenses for PS2, GameCube and Xbox
console systems and GBA hand-held device with the owners of each such
platform.  Each license allows us to
create multiple products for the applicable platform, subject to certain
approval rights which are reserved by each licensor.  Each license also requires that we pay the licensor a per unit
royalty for each unit manufactured.  In
contrast, we are not required to obtain any license for the development and
production of products for PCs.

Intellectual Property Rights.

Many of our current and planned releases are
based on intellectual property and other character or story rights licensed
from third parties, as well as a combination of characters, worlds and concepts
derived from our extensive library of titles, and original characters and
concepts owned and created by us.  When
publishing products based on licensed intellectual property rights, we
generally seek to capitalize on the name recognition, marketing efforts and
goodwill associated with the underlying property. For Activision-owned
intellectual property, we generally attempt to establish such properties as
sustainable, long-term game franchises.


In acquiring intellectual property rights
from third parties, we seek to obtain rights to publish titles across a variety
of platforms, to include the ability to produce multiple titles and to retain
rights over an extended period of time. 
In past years, we have been able to enter into a series of long-term or
multi-product agreements with owners of various intellectual properties that
are well known throughout the world and to create products based on these
recognizable characters, story lines or concepts.  These agreements typically provide us with exclusive publishing
rights for a specific period of time and, in some cases, for specified
platforms. The scope of our licensing activities includes theatrical motion
pictures, television shows, animated films and series, comic books, literary
works, sports personalities and events and celebrities. We intend to continue
expanding relationships with our existing intellectual property partners and to
enter into agreements with other intellectual property owners for additional
recognizable properties, characters, story lines and concepts.  However, we may not be able to maintain or
expand our existing relationships or to seek out and sustain new long-term
relationships of similar caliber in the future.

Product Development and Support

We develop and produce titles using a model
in which a core group of creative, production and technical professionals, in
coordination with our marketing and finance departments, have responsibility
for the entire development and production process including the supervision and
coordination of internal and external resources.  This team assembles the necessary creative elements to complete a
title using, where appropriate, outside programmers, artists, animators,
scriptwriters, musicians and songwriters, sound effects and special effects
experts, and sound and video studios. 
We believe that this model allows us to supplement internal expertise
with top quality external resources on an as-needed basis.

In addition, we often seek out and engage
independent third-party developers to create products on our behalf.  Such products are sometimes owned by us, and
usually we have unlimited rights to commercially exploit these products.  In other circumstances, the third-party
developer may retain ownership of the intellectual property and/or technology
included in the product and reserve certain exploitation rights. We typically
select these independent third-party developers based on their expertise in developing
products in a specific category and use the same developer to produce the same
game for multiple platforms.  Each of
our third-party developers is under contract with us for specific or multiple
titles.  From time to time, we also
acquire the license rights to publish and/or distribute software products that
are or will be independently created by third-party developers.  In such cases, the agreements with such
developers provide us with exclusive publishing and/or distribution rights for
a specific period of time, often for specified platforms and territories.  In either case, we often have the ability to
publish and/or distribute sequels, conversions, enhancements and add-ons to the
product initially being produced by the independent developer and frequently
have the right to engage the services of the original developer with regard to
the development of such products.

In consideration for the services that the
independent third-party developer provides, it receives a royalty generally
based on net sales of the product that it has developed.  Typically, the developer also receives an
advance, which we recoup from the royalties otherwise payable to the
developer.  The advance generally is
paid in “milestone” stages. The payment at each stage is tied to the completion
and delivery of a detailed performance milestone.  Working with an independent developer allows us to reduce our
fixed development costs, share development risks with the third-party
developer, take advantage of the third-party developer’s expertise in
connection with certain categories of products or certain platforms, and gain
access to proprietary development technologies.

From time to time, we may make a capital
investment and hold a minority interest in a third-party developer in connection
with interactive entertainment software products to be developed by such
developer for us, which we believe helps to create a closer relationship
between us and the developer.  We
account for those capital investments over which we have the ability to
exercise significant influence using the equity method.  For those investments over which we do not
have the ability to exercise significant influence, we account for our
investment using the cost method.  There
can be no assurance that we will realize long-term benefits from such
investments or that we will continue to carry such investments at their current
value.

“Greenlight Process”

We have adopted and implemented a rigorous
procedure for the selection, development, production and quality assurance of
our internally and externally produced interactive entertainment software
titles. The process, known internally as the “Greenlight Process,” involves six
phases throughout the development and production phases of a title, each of
which includes a number of specific performance milestones.  The six phases of the “Greenlight Process”
are the concept, assessment, prototype, first playable, alpha and beta.  This procedure is designed to enable


us to manage
and control production and development budgets and timetables, to identify and
address production and technical issues at the earliest opportunity, and to
coordinate marketing and quality control strategies throughout the production
and development phases, all in an environment that fosters creativity.  Checks and balances are intended to be
provided through the structured interaction of the project team with our
creative, technical, marketing and quality assurance/customer support
personnel, as well as the legal, accounting and finance departments.  In order to maintain the competitiveness of
our products and to take advantage of increasingly sophisticated technology
associated with hardware platforms, our development process includes a
significant amount of time for play-testing new products and extensive product
quality evaluations.

Product Support

We provide various forms of product support
to both our internally and externally developed titles.  Our quality assurance personnel are involved
throughout the development and production of each title published by us.  We subject all such products to extensive
testing before release to ensure compatibility with all appropriate hardware
systems and configurations and to minimize the number of bugs and other defects
found in the products.  To support our
products after release, we provide online access to our customers on a 24-hour
basis as well as operator help lines during regular business hours.  The customer support group tracks customer
inquiries, and we use this data to help improve the development and production
processes.

Publishing Activities

Marketing

Our marketing efforts include online
activities (such as the creation of World Wide Web pages to promote specific
titles), public relations, print and broadcast advertising, coordinated
in-store and industry promotions (including merchandising and point of purchase
displays), participation in cooperative advertising programs, direct response
vehicles, and product sampling through demonstration software distributed
through the Internet or on compact discs. 
From time to time, we also receive marketing support from hardware
manufacturers and retailers in connection with their own promotional efforts.  In addition, certain of our products contain
software that enables customers to “electronically register” their purchases
with us online.

We believe that certain of our franchise
properties have loyal and devoted audiences who purchase our sequels as a
result of dedication to the property and satisfaction from previous product
purchases.  We therefore market these
sequels both toward the established market as well as broader audiences.  In addition, in marketing titles based on
licensed properties, we believe that we derive benefits from the continued
exploitation of these licensed properties and the marketing and promotional
activities of the property owners.

Sales and Distribution

Domestic.

Our products are available for sale or rental in thousands of retail
outlets domestically.  Our domestic
customers include Best Buy, Blockbuster, Circuit City, Electronic Boutique,
GameStop, Target, Toys “R” Us and Wal-Mart. 
Our largest customer, Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 20% and 16%
of our consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In the United States and Canada, our products
are sold primarily on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer
electronics stores, discount warehouses and game specialty stores.  We believe that a direct relationship with
retail accounts results in more effective inventory management, merchandising
and communications than would be possible through indirect relationships.  We have implemented electronic data
interchange linkages with many of our retailers to facilitate the placing and
shipping of orders.  We sell our
products to a limited number of distributors.

International.

Our products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail
basis, through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements, and through
our wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries.  We conduct our international publishing activities through
offices in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Sweden,
Australia, and Japan.  Whenever
practicable, we seek to maximize our worldwide revenues and profits by releasing
high quality foreign language releases concurrently with English language
releases and by continuing to expand the number of direct selling relationships
we maintain with key retailers in major territories.

Affiliate Labels.

In addition to our own products, we distribute a select number of
interactive entertainment products that are developed and marketed by other
third-party publishers through our “affiliate label” programs in


North America
and Europe. The distribution of other publishers’ products allows us to
increase the efficiencies of our sales force and provides us with the ability
to better ensure adequate shelf presence at retail stores for all of the
products that we distribute. Distributing other publishers’ titles mitigates
the risk associated with a particular title or titles published by us failing
to achieve expectations. Services provided by us under our affiliate label
program include order solicitation, in-store marketing, logistics and order
fulfillment, sales channel management, as well as other accounting and general
administrative functions. Our current affiliate label partners include
LucasArts, as well several affiliate label partners in our “value” business.
Each affiliate label relationship is unique and may pertain only to
distribution in certain geographic territories such as the United States or
Europe and may be further limited only to specific titles or titles for
specific platforms.

Distribution

We distribute interactive entertainment
hardware and software products in Europe through our European distribution
subsidiaries, Centresoft in the United Kingdom, NBG in Germany and CD Contact
in the Benelux countries.  These
subsidiaries act as wholesalers in the distribution of products and also
provide packaging, logistical and sales services, and in some cases, product
localization for certain vendors.  They
provide services to our publishing operations and to various third-party publishers,
including Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft. 
Centresoft is Sony’s exclusive distributor of PlayStation products to
the independent channel in the United Kingdom. 
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, sales for Sony, Nintendo and
Microsoft accounted for approximately 23%, 5% and 4%, respectively, of our
worldwide distribution net revenues.

We acquired Centresoft and NBG in 1997 and CD
Contact in 1998.  We entered into the
distribution business to obtain distribution capacity in Europe for our own
products, while supporting the distribution infrastructure with third-party
sales, and to diversify our operations into the European market.  Centresoft and our other distribution
subsidiaries operate in accordance with strict confidentiality procedures in
order to provide independent services to various third-party publishers.

Emerging Technologies

We are
actively supporting emerging platforms (wireless devices, closed and open
online networks, and interactive television) by publishing and licensing key
brands, such as

Shrek 2

,

Tony Hawk’s Underground,

and

Call of Duty

for these emerging
platforms.  We also develop and optimize
our titles for consoles that support online play, such as PS2 and Xbox.  Currently, we have released versions of

Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater

titles and

Tony Hawk’s Underground

for the PS2’s
online service, as well as

MTX: Mototrax,
Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Soldier of Fortune 2

and

Tenchu: Return from Darkness

for
Xbox Live, Microsoft’s online service. 
We have published and licensed rights to various brands, such as

Spider-Man 2: The Movie

, for various
hand-held wireless devices, such as Nokia’s N-Gage wireless platform, as well
as many traditional wireless handsets. 
We believe that more of our brands can be successfully published for
wireless and online platforms, as well as exploited through other emerging
technologies, as they continue to evolve.

Manufacturing

We prepare a set of master program copies,
documentation and packaging materials for our products for each hardware
platform on which the product will be released.  Except with respect to products for use on the Sony, Nintendo and
Microsoft systems, our disk duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing,
warehousing, assembly and shipping are performed by third-party subcontractors.

To maintain protection over their hardware
technologies, Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft generally specify or control the
manufacturing and assembly of finished products. We deliver the master
materials to the licensor or its approved replicator, which then manufactures
finished goods and delivers them to us for distribution under our label.  At the time our product unit orders are
filled by the manufacturer, we become responsible for the costs of
manufacturing and the applicable per unit royalty on such units, even if the
units do not ultimately sell.

To date, we have not experienced any material
difficulties or delays in the manufacture and assembly of our products or
material returns due to product defects.


Competition

The interactive entertainment industry is
extremely competitive.  The availability
of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in the
industry primarily as a result of the escalating development, acquisition,
production and marketing budgets required to publish quality titles.  In addition, competitors with larger product
lines and popular titles typically have greater leverage with retailers,
distributors and other customers who may be willing to promote titles with less
consumer appeal in return for access to such competitor’s most popular titles.

Employees

As of March 31, 2004, we had 1,324 employees,
including 688 in product development, 129 in North American publishing, 104 in
international publishing, 114 in operations, corporate finance and
administration, and 289 in European distribution activities.

As of March 31, 2004, 178 of our full-time
employees were subject to term employment agreements with us.  These agreements generally commit such
employees to employment terms of between one and five years from the
commencement of their respective agreements. 
Most of the employees subject to such agreements are executive officers
or key members of the product development, sales or marketing divisions.  These individuals perform services for us as
executives, directors, producers, associate producers, computer programmers,
game designers, sales directors and marketing product managers.  The execution by us of employment agreements
with such employees, in our experience, reduces our turnover during the
development, production and distribution phases of our entertainment software
products and allows us to plan more effectively for future development and
marketing activities.

None of our employees is subject to a collective
bargaining agreement except for the employees of our German distribution
subsidiary who are allowed by German law to belong to an organized labor
council.  To date, we have not
experienced any labor-related work stoppages.

Factors Affecting Future Performance

In connection with the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Litigation Reform Act”), we are hereby
disclosing certain cautionary information to be used in connection with written
materials (including this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and oral statements made
by or on behalf of our employees and representatives that may contain
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Litigation Reform
Act.  Such statements consist of any
statement other than a recitation of historical fact and can be identified by
the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“estimate” or “continue” or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or
comparable terminology.  You are
cautioned that all forward-looking statements are necessarily speculative and
there are numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or
results to differ materially from those referred to in such forward-looking
statements.  These forward looking
statements are subject to business and economic risk and reflect management’s
current expectations and are inherently uncertain and difficult to
predict.  The discussion below
highlights some of the more important risks identified by management, but
should not be assumed to be the only factors that could affect future
performance.  You are cautioned that we
do not have a policy of updating or revising forward-looking statements, and
thus you should not assume that silence by management over time means that
actual events are bearing out as estimated in such forward-looking statements.

We depend on a relatively small number of brands for a
significant portion of our revenues and profits.

A significant portion of our revenues is
derived from products based on a relatively small number of popular brands each
year, and these products are responsible for a disproportionate amount of our
profits.  In addition, many of these
products have substantial production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets.  In fiscal 2004, 31% of our consolidated net
revenues (44% of worldwide publishing net revenues) was derived from two
brands, one of which accounted for 17% and the other of which accounted for 14%
of consolidated net revenues (24% and 20%, respectively, of worldwide
publishing net revenues).  In fiscal
2003, 38% of our consolidated net revenues (52% of worldwide publishing net
revenues) was derived from two brands, one of which accounted for 20% and the
other of which accounted for 18% of consolidated net revenues (27% and 25%,
respectively, of worldwide publishing net revenues).  In fiscal 2002, two brands accounted for 35% of our consolidated
net revenues (50% of worldwide publishing net revenues), one of which accounted
for 31% and the other of which accounted for 4% of consolidated net revenues
(44% and 6%, respectively, of worldwide publishing net revenues).  We expect that a limited number of popular
brands will continue to produce a disproportionately large amount of our
revenues and profits.  Due to this


dependence on
a limited number of brands, the failure to achieve anticipated results by one
or more products based on these brands may significantly harm our business and
financial results.

Our future success depends on our ability to release popular
products.

The life of any one game product is
relatively short, in many cases less than one year.  It is therefore important for us to be able to continue to
develop many high quality new products that are popularly received.  We focus our development and publishing
activities principally on products that are, or have the potential to become,
franchise brand properties.  If we are
unable to do this, our business and financial results may be negatively
affected.

If we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to
intellectual property, we may publish fewer “hit” titles and our revenue may
decline.

Many of our products are based on
intellectual property and other character or story rights acquired or licensed
from third parties.  These license and
distribution agreements are limited in scope and time, and we may not be able
to renew key licenses when they expire or to include new products in existing
licenses.  The loss of a significant
number of our intellectual property licenses or of our relationships with
licensors, or inability to obtain additional licenses of significant commercial
value could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop new
products and therefore on our business and financial results.  Additionally, the failure of intellectual
property acquired by us to be popularly received could impact the market
acceptance of our products in which the intellectual property is included.  Such lack of market acceptance could result
in the write-off of the unrecovered portion of acquired intellectual property
assets, which could cause material harm to our business and financial results.

Transitions in console platforms could have a material
impact on the market for interactive entertainment software.

When new console platforms are announced or
introduced into the market, consumers typically reduce their purchases of game
console entertainment software products for current console platforms in
anticipation of new platforms becoming available.  During these periods, sales of our game console entertainment
software products may be expected to slow or even decline until new platforms
are introduced and achieve wide consumer acceptance.  Each of the three current principal hardware producers launched a
new platform in recent years.  In
calendar 2003, Sony announced that it would be entering the hand-held hardware
market with the introduction of its hand-held gaming device, PSP.  PSP is currently expected to be released in
the United States toward the end of the first quarter of calendar 2005.  Most recently, Nintendo also announced that
it plans to launch a new dual-screened, portable game system, NDS, before the
end of calendar 2004.  We are currently
developing titles for the PSP and the NDS with the objective of having one or
more titles at launch for each of these platforms.  The introduction of PSP and NDS may have a negative effect on the
sale of our GBA titles. We are also planning to develop titles for the next
generation console systems expected to be developed by Sony, Microsoft and
Nintendo for release in the next two to three years. We estimate that the next
console hardware transition cycle will commence in late calendar 2005 or
calendar 2006.  Delays in the launch,
shortages, technical problems or lack of consumer acceptance of the next
generation platforms could adversely affect our sales of products for these
platforms.

We must make significant expenditures to develop products
for new platforms which may not be successful or released when anticipated.

The interactive entertainment software
industry is subject to rapid technological change.  New technologies could render our current products or products in
development obsolete or unmarketable. 
We must continually anticipate and assess the emergence and market acceptance
of new interactive entertainment hardware platforms well in advance of the time
the platform is introduced to consumers. 
New platforms have historically required the development of new software
and also have the effect of undermining demand for products based on older
technologies.  Because product
development cycles are difficult to predict, we must make substantial product
development and other investments in a particular platform well in advance of
introduction of the platform.  If the
platforms for which we develop new software products or modify existing
products are not released on a timely basis or do not attain significant market
penetration, or if we develop products for a delayed or unsuccessful platform,
we may not be able to recover in revenues our development costs, which could be
significant, and our business and financial results could be significantly
harmed.


We are exposed to seasonality in the purchases of our
products.

The interactive entertainment software
industry is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand
occurring during the year-end holiday buying season.  As a result, our net revenues, gross profits and operating income
have historically been highest during the second half of the calendar
year.  Additionally, in a platform
transition period, sales of game console software products can be significantly
affected by the timeliness of introduction of game console platforms by the
manufacturers of those platforms, such as Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo.  The timing of hardware platform introduction
is also often tied to holidays and is not within our control.  If a hardware platform is released
unexpectedly close to the holidays, this would result in a shortened holiday
buying season and could negatively impact the sales of our products.  Further, delays in development, licensor
approvals or manufacturing can also affect the timing of the release of our
products, causing us to miss key selling periods such as the year-end holiday
buying season.

We depend on skilled personnel.

Our success depends to a significant extent
on our ability to identify, hire and retain skilled personnel.  The software industry is characterized by a
high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors for
personnel with technical, marketing, sales, product development and management
skills.  We may not be able to attract
and retain skilled personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do
so.  If we are unable to attract
additional qualified employees or retain the services of key personnel, our
business and financial results could be negatively impacted.

Our
platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the
manufacturing of and have broad approval rights over our video game products.

Generally, when we develop interactive
entertainment software products for hardware platforms offered by Sony,
Nintendo or Microsoft, the products are manufactured exclusively by that
hardware manufacturer or their approved replicator.

Our agreements with these manufacturers
include certain provisions, such as approval rights over all products and
related promotional materials and the ability to change the fee they charge for
the manufacturing of products, that allow them substantial influence over our
costs and the release schedule of our products.  In addition, since each of the manufacturers is also a publisher
of games for its own hardware platforms and manufactures products for all of
its other licensees, a manufacturer may give priority to its own products or
those of our competitors in the event of insufficient manufacturing
capacity.  Accordingly, Sony, Nintendo
or Microsoft could cause unanticipated delays in the release of our products as
well as increases to our development, manufacturing, marketing or distribution
costs, which could materially harm our business and financial results.

In addition, as online capabilities for video
game platforms emerge, our platform licensors will control our ability to
provide online game capabilities for our console platform products and will in
large part establish the financial terms on which these services are offered to
consumers.  Currently, both Microsoft
and Sony provide online capabilities for Xbox and PS2 products,
respectively.  In each case,
compatibility code and the consent of the licensor are required for us to
include online capabilities in our products. 
In addition, the business model for Microsoft’s and Sony’s online
businesses for their video game products may compete with our online business.
As these capabilities become more significant, the failure or refusal of our
licensors to approve our products, or the successful deployment by these
licensors of services competitive to ours, may harm our business.

Our
platform licensors set the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to
publish games for their platforms, and therefore have significant influence on
our costs.

We pay a licensing fee to the hardware
manufacturer for each copy of a product manufactured for that manufacturer’s
game platform.  In the next few years,
we expect our platform licensors to introduce new hardware platforms into the
market.  In order to publish products
for new hardware platforms, we must take a license from the platform licensor
which gives the platform licensor the opportunity to set the fee structure that
we must pay in order to publish games for that platform.  Similarly, the platform licensors have
retained the flexibility to change their fee structures for online gameplay and
features for their consoles and the manufacturing of products.  The control that platform licensors have
over the fee structures for their future platforms and online access makes it
difficult for us to predict our costs and profitability in the medium to long
term.  Because publishing products for
console systems is the


largest
portion of our business, any increase in fee structures would have a
significant negative impact on our business model and profitability.

If our products contain defects, our business could be
harmed significantly.

Software products as complex as the ones we
publish may contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new
versions are released.  Despite extensive
testing prior to release, we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in
new products or releases after shipment, that could result in loss of or delay
in market acceptance.  This loss or
delay could significantly harm our business and financial results.

Inadequate intellectual property protections could prevent
us from enforcing or defending our proprietary technology.

We regard our software as proprietary and
rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, employee and
third-party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our
proprietary rights.  We own or license
various copyrights and trademarks. 
Although we provide “shrinkwrap” license agreements or limitations on
use with our software, it is uncertain to what extent these agreements and
limitations are enforceable.  We are
aware that some unauthorized copying occurs within the computer software
industry, and if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our
interactive entertainment software products were to occur, it could cause
material harm to our business and financial results.

Policing unauthorized use of our products is
difficult, and software piracy is a persistent problem, especially in some
international markets.  Further, the laws
of some countries where our products are or may be distributed either do not
protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the
laws of the United States, or are poorly enforced.  Legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in such
countries.  Moreover, as we leverage our
software products using emerging technologies such as the Internet and online
services, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and to avoid
infringing intellectual property rights of others may diminish.  We cannot be certain that existing
intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in
connection with these emerging technologies.

We may be subject to intellectual property claims.

As the number of interactive entertainment
software products increases and the features and content of these products
continue to overlap, software developers increasingly may become subject to
infringement claims.  Many of our
products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on real
world examples, which may inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property
rights of others.  Our products often
utilize complex, cutting edge technology that may become subject to the
intellectual property rights of others.  Although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that
our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others, it is
possible that third parties still may claim infringement.  From time to time, we receive communications
from third parties regarding such claims. 
Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid or not,
may be time consuming and expensive to defend.

Intellectual property litigation or claims
could force us to do one or more of the following:

•

Cease selling,
incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged
intellectual property;

•

Obtain a
license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which if
available at all, may not be available on commercially favorable terms; or

•

Redesign the
effected interactive entertainment software products, which could cause us to
incur additional costs, delay introduction and possibly reduce commercial
appeal of our products.

Any of these actions may cause
material harm to our business and financial results.

We rely on independent third parties to develop some of our
software products.

We rely on independent third-party
interactive entertainment software developers to develop some of our software
products.  Since we depend on these
developers in the aggregate, we remain subject to the following risks:


•

Continuing
strong demand for developers’ resources, combined with the recognition they
receive in connection with their work, may cause developers who worked for us
in the past either to work for our competitors in the future or to renegotiate
our agreements with them on terms less favorable for us.

•

Limited
financial resources and business expertise and inability to retain skilled
personnel may force developers out of business prior to completing our products
or require us to fund additional costs.

•

Our
competitors may acquire the businesses of key developers or sign them to
exclusive development arrangements.  In
either case, we would not be able to continue to engage such developers’
services for our products, except for those that they are contractually
obligated to complete for us.

Increased
competition for skilled third-party software developers also has compelled us
to agree to make significant advance payments on royalties to game
developers.  If the products subject to
these arrangements do not generate sufficient revenues to recover these royalty
advances, we would have to write-off unrecovered portions of these payments,
which could cause material harm to our business and financial results.  Typically, we pay developers a royalty based
on a percentage of net revenue, less agreed upon deductions, but in a few
cases, we have agreed to pay developers fixed per unit product royalties after
royalty advances are fully recouped.  To
the extent that sales prices of products on which we have agreed to pay a fixed
per unit royalty are marked down, our profitability could be adversely
affected.

We operate in a highly competitive industry.

The interactive entertainment software
industry is intensely competitive and new interactive entertainment software
products and platforms are regularly introduced.  Our competitors vary in size from small companies with limited
resources to very large corporations with significantly greater financial,
marketing and product development resources than we have.  Due to these greater resources, certain of
our competitors can spend more money and time on developing and testing
products, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive
pricing policies, pay higher fees to licensors for desirable motion picture,
television, sports and character properties and pay more to third-party
software developers than we can.  We
believe that the main competitive factors in the interactive entertainment
software industry include: product features and playability; brand name
recognition; compatibility of products with popular platforms; access to
distribution channels; quality of products; ease of use; price; marketing
support; and quality of customer service.

We compete primarily with other publishers of
personal computer and video game console interactive entertainment
software.  Significant third-party
software competitors currently include, among others: Atari, Inc.; Capcom Co.
Ltd.; Eidos PLC; Electronic Arts Inc.; Konami Company Ltd.; Namco Ltd.; Sega
Enterprises, Ltd.; Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.; THQ Inc.; Ubi Soft
Entertainment and Vivendi Universal Publishing.  In addition, integrated video game console hardware and software
companies such as Sony Computer Entertainment, Nintendo Co. Ltd. and Microsoft
Corporation compete directly with us in the development of software titles for
their respective platforms.

We also compete with other forms of
entertainment and leisure activities. 
For example, we believe that the overall growth in the use of the
Internet and online services by consumers may pose a competitive threat if
customers and potential customers spend less of their available time using
interactive entertainment software and more using the Internet and online
services.

We may face difficulty obtaining access to retail shelf
space necessary to market and sell our products effectively.

Retailers of our products typically have a
limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources, and there is intense
competition among consumer interactive entertainment software products for high
quality retail shelf space and promotional support from retailers.  To the extent that the number of products
and platforms increases, competition for shelf space may intensify and may
require us to increase our marketing expenditures.  Retailers with limited shelf space typically devote the most and
highest quality shelf space to those products expected to be best sellers.  We cannot be certain that our new products
will consistently achieve such “best seller” status.  Due to increased competition for limited shelf space, retailers
and distributors are in an increasingly better position to negotiate favorable
terms of sale, including price discounts, price protection, marketing and
display fees and product return policies. 
Our products constitute a relatively small percentage of any retailer’s
sales volume, and we cannot be certain that retailers will continue to purchase
our products or to provide our products with adequate levels of shelf


space and
promotional support on acceptable terms. 
A prolonged failure in this regard may significantly harm our business
and financial results.

Our sales may decline substantially without warning and in a
brief period of time because we do not have long-term contracts for the sale of
our products.

In the United States and Canada, we primarily
sell our products on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer
electronics stores, discount warehouses and game specialty stores.  Our products are sold internationally on a
direct-to-retail basis, through third-party distribution and licensing
arrangements and through our wholly-owned European distribution
subsidiaries.  Our sales are made
primarily on a purchase order basis without long-term agreements or other forms
of commitments.  Our largest customer,
Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 20% and 16% of our consolidated net
revenues for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any of our
principal retail customers or distributors could significantly harm our business
and financial results.

We may permit our customers to return our products and to
receive pricing concessions which could reduce our net revenues and results of
operations.

We are exposed to the risk of product returns
and price protection with respect to our distributors and retailers. Return
policies allow distributors and retailers to return defective, shelf-worn and
damaged products in accordance with terms granted. Price protection, when
granted and applicable, allows customers a credit against amounts they owe us
with respect to merchandise unsold by them. We may permit product returns from,
or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions.  The conditions our customers must meet to be
granted the right to return products or price protection are, among other
things, compliance with applicable payment terms, delivery to us of weekly
inventory and sell-through reports, and consistent participation in the
launches of our premium title releases. 
We may also consider other factors, including the facilitation of
slow-moving inventory and other market factors.  When we offer price protection, we offer it with respect to a
particular product to all of our retail customers; however, only those
customers who meet the conditions detailed above can avail themselves of such
price protection.  We also offer a
90-day limited warranty to our end users that our products will be free from
manufacturing defects. Although we maintain a reserve for returns and price
protection, and although we may place limits on product returns and price protection,
we could be forced to accept substantial product returns and provide
substantial price protection to maintain our relationships with retailers and
our access to distribution channels. Product returns and price protection that
exceed our reserves could significantly harm our business and financial
results.

We may be burdened with payment defaults and uncollectible
accounts if our distributors or retailers cannot honor their credit arrangement
with us.

Distributors and retailers in the interactive
entertainment software industry have from time to time experienced significant
fluctuations in their businesses, and a number of them have failed.  The insolvency or business failure of any
significant retailer or distributor of our products could materially harm our
business and financial results.  We
typically make sales to most of our retailers and some distributors on
unsecured credit, with terms that vary depending upon the customer’s credit
history, solvency, credit limits and sales history, as well as whether we can
obtain sufficient credit insurance. 
Although, as in the case with most of our customers, we have insolvency
risk insurance to protect against our customers’ bankruptcy, insolvency or
liquidation, this insurance contains a significant deductible and a co-payment
obligation, and the policy does not cover all instances of non-payment.  In addition, although we maintain a reserve
for uncollectible receivables, the reserve may not be sufficient in every
circumstance.  As a result, a payment default
by a significant customer could significantly harm our business and financial
results.

We may not be able to maintain our distribution
relationships with key vendors.

Our CD Contact, NBG and Centresoft
subsidiaries distribute interactive entertainment software and hardware
products and provide related services in the Benelux countries, Germany and the
United Kingdom, respectively, and via export in other European countries for a
variety of entertainment software publishers, many of which are our competitors,
and hardware manufacturers.  These
services are generally performed under limited term contracts.  Although we expect to use reasonable efforts
to retain these vendors, we may not be successful in this regard.  The cancellation or non-renewal of one or
more of these contracts could significantly harm our business and financial
results.  Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft
products accounted for approximately 23%, 5% and 4%, respectively, of our
worldwide distribution net revenues for fiscal 2004.


Our international revenues may be subject to regulatory
requirements as well as currency fluctuations.

Our international revenues have accounted for
a significant portion of our total revenues. 
International sales and licensing accounted for 53%, 50% and 49% of our
consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  We expect that international revenues will
continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues in the
future.  International sales may be
subject to unexpected regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers.  Additionally, foreign sales that are made in
local currencies may fluctuate. We have and may continue to engage in limited
currency hedging activities.  Currency
exchange rates fluctuations may in the future have a material positive or
negative impact on revenues from international sales and licensing and thus our
business and financial results.

Our business,
our products and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key
territories of content, consumer piracy and online delivery.  If we do not successfully respond to these
regulations, our business may suffer.

Legislation is continually being introduced
that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution.  For example, privacy laws in the United
States and Europe impose various restrictions on our web sites.  Those rules vary by territory although the
Internet recognizes no geographical boundaries.  In addition, many foreign countries have laws that permit
governmental entities to censor the content and advertising of interactive
entertainment software.  Other
countries, such as Germany, have adopted laws regulating content both in
packaged goods and those transmitted over the Internet that are stricter than
current United States laws.  In the
United States, federal and several state governments are considering content
restrictions on products such as ours, as well as restrictions on distribution
of such products.  We may be required to
modify our products or alter our marketing strategies to comply with new
regulations, which could delay the release of our products in those
countries.  Due to the uncertainties
regarding such regulations, confusion in the marketplace may occur, and we are
unable to predict what effect, if any, such regulations would have on our
business.

In addition to such regulations, certain
retailers have in the past declined to stock some of our products because they
believed that the content of the packaging artwork or the products would be
offensive to the retailer’s customer base. 
Although to date these actions have not caused material harm to our
business, we cannot assure you that similar actions by our distributors or
retailers in the future would not cause material harm to our business.

Our products may be subject to legal claims.

In prior fiscal years, two lawsuits,

Linda
Sanders, et al. v. Meow Media, Inc., et al.

, United States District
Court for the District of Colorado, and

Joe James, et al. v. Meow Media, Inc., et al.

,
United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, Paducah
Division, have been filed against numerous video game companies, including us,
by the families of victims who were shot and killed by teenage gunmen in
attacks perpetrated at schools.  These
lawsuits alleged that the video game companies manufactured and/or supplied
these teenagers with violent video games, teaching them how to use a gun and
causing them to act out in a violent manner. 
These lawsuits have been dismissed. 
Similar additional lawsuits may be filed in the future.  Although our general liability insurance
carrier agreed to defend us in such lawsuits in the past, it is uncertain
whether the insurance carrier would do so in the future, or if it would cover
all or any amounts which we might be liable for if such future lawsuits are not
decided in our favor.  If such future
lawsuits are filed and ultimately decided against us and our insurance carrier
does not cover the amounts we are liable for, it could have a material adverse
effect on our business and financial results. 
Payment of significant claims by insurance carriers may make such
insurance coverage materially more expensive or unavailable in the future,
thereby exposing our business to additional risk.

We may face limitations on our ability to find suitable
acquisition opportunities or to integrate additional acquired businesses.

We intend to pursue additional acquisitions
of companies, properties and other assets that can be purchased or licensed on
acceptable terms and which we believe can be operated or exploited
profitably.  Some of these transactions
could be material in size and scope. 
Although we continue to search for additional acquisition opportunities,
we may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisitions.  As the interactive entertainment software
industry continues to consolidate, we face significant competition in seeking
and consummating acquisition opportunities. 
We may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or an
acquisition may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase
our earnings.  In the future, we may
issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with one or more
acquisitions, which may dilute our existing shareholders.  Future acquisitions could also divert
substantial management time and result in short-term reductions in earnings or
special transaction or other charges. 
In addition,


we cannot
guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate the businesses that we
may acquire into our existing business. 
Our shareholders may not have the opportunity to review, vote on or
evaluate future acquisitions.

Our shareholder rights plan, charter documents and other
agreements may make it more difficult to acquire us without the approval of our
Board of Directors.

We have adopted a shareholder
rights plan under which one right entitling the holder to purchase one
one-hundredths (1/100) of a share of our Series A Junior Preferred Stock price
at an exercise price of $40 per share (subject to adjustment) is attached to
each outstanding share of common stock. 
Such shareholder rights plan makes an acquisition of control in a
transaction not approved by our Board of Directors more difficult.  Our Amended and Restated By-laws have
advance notice provisions for nominations for election of nominees to the Board
of Directors which may make it more difficult to acquire control of us.  Our long-term incentive plans provide, in
the discretion of a committee, for acceleration of stock options following a
change in control under certain circumstances, which has the effect of making
an acquisition of control more expensive. 
In addition, some of our officers have severance compensation agreements
that provide for substantial cash payments and accelerations of other benefits
in the event of a change in control. 
These agreements and arrangements may also inhibit a change in control.

Our reported financial results could be affected if significant changes
in current accounting principles are adopted.

Recent actions and public comments from the
Securities and Exchange Commission have focused on the integrity of financial
reporting generally. Similarly, Congress has considered a variety of bills that
could affect certain accounting principles. The Financial Accounting Standards
Board and other regulatory accounting agencies have recently introduced several
new or proposed accounting standards, such as accounting for stock options, some
of which represent a significant change from current practices. Changes in our
accounting for stock options could materially increase our reported expenses.

Our stock price is highly volatile.

The trading price of our common stock has
been and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many
factors, including:

•

Quarter
to quarter variations in results of operations

•

Our
announcements of new products

•

Our
competitors’ announcements of new products

•

Our
product development or release schedule

•

General
conditions in the computer, software, entertainment, media or electronics
industries and in the economy

•

Timing of
the introduction of new platforms and delays in the actual release of new
platforms

•

Hardware
manufacturers’ announcements of price reductions in hardware platforms

•

Changes
in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts

•

Investor
perceptions and expectations regarding our products, plans and strategic
position and those of our competitors and customers

In addition, the public stock markets
experience extreme price and trading volume volatility, particularly in high
technology sectors of the market.  This
volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many
technology companies for reasons often unrelated to the operating performance
of the specific companies.  These broad
market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.


We seek to manage
our business with a view to achieving long-term results, and this could have a
negative effect on short-term trading.

We focus on creation of shareholder value over time, and we intend to
make decisions that will be consistent with this long-term view.  As a result, some of our decisions, such as
whether to make or discontinue operating investments, manage our balance sheet
and capital structure, or pursue or discontinue strategic initiatives, may be
in conflict with the objectives of short-term traders.  Further, this could adversely affect our
quarterly or other short-term results of operations.

We do not pay cash dividends on our common stock.

We have not paid any cash dividends on our
common stock nor do we anticipate paying cash dividends in the near future.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On March 5,
2004, a class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our current
and former officers and directors.  The
complaint, which asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on allegations that our revenues and
assets were overstated during the period between February 1, 2001 and December
17, 2002, was filed in the United States District Court, Central District of
California by the Construction Industry and Carpenters Joint Pension Trust for
Southern Nevada purporting to represent a class of purchasers of Activision
stock.  Five additional purported class
actions have subsequently been filed by Gianni Angeloni, Christopher Hinton,
Stephen Anish, the Alaska Electrical Pension Fund, and Joseph A. Romans
asserting the same claims.  Five of the
six actions have been transferred to the same court where the first-filed
complaint was pending.  In addition, on
March 12, 2004, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed, purportedly on
behalf of Activision, which in large measure asserts the identical claims set
forth in the federal class action lawsuit. 
That complaint was filed in Superior Court for the County of Los
Angeles.  We strongly deny these
allegations and will vigorously defend these cases.

On July 11, 2003, we were informed by the staff of the Securities and
Exchange Commission that the Securities and Exchange Commission has commenced a
non-public formal investigation captioned “In the Matter of Certain Video Game
Manufacturers and Distributors.” The investigation appears to be focused on
certain accounting practices common to the interactive entertainment industry,
with specific emphasis on revenue recognition. 
In connection with this inquiry, the Securities and Exchange Commission
submitted to us a request for information. 
We responded to this


inquiry on
September 2, 2003.  To date, we have not
received a request from the Securities and Exchange Commission for any
additional information.  The Securities
and Exchange Commission staff also informed us that other companies in the
video game industry received similar requests for information. The Securities
and Exchange Commission has advised us that this request for information should
not be construed as an indication from the Securities and Exchange Commission
or its staff that any violation of the law has occurred, nor should it reflect
negatively on any person, entity or security. We have cooperated and intend to
continue to cooperate fully with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the
conduct of this inquiry.

On June 30, 2003, we terminated our Star Trek
Merchandising License Agreement with Viacom Consumer Products, Inc. and filed a
complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California for breach of
contract and constructive trust against Viacom Consumer Products and Viacom
International, Inc. (“Viacom”). On August 15, 2003, Viacom filed its response
to our complaint as well as a cross-complaint alleging, among other matters, a
breach of contract by Activision and seeking claimed damages in excess of $50
million. We strongly dispute the claims by Viacom, consider the damages alleged
by Viacom to be speculative and without merit, and intend to defend vigorously
and aggressively against the cross-complaint.

In addition, w

e
are party to other routine claims and suits brought by us and against us in the
ordinary course of business, including disputes arising over the ownership of
intellectual property rights, contractual claims and collection matters.  In the opinion of management, after
consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such routine claims will not
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON
EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq
National Market under the symbol “ATVI.”

The following table sets forth for the
periods indicated the high and low reported sale prices for our common
stock.  As of May 26, 2004, there were
approximately 2,840 holders of record of our common stock.

On May 26, 2004, the last reported sales
price of our common stock was $15.88.

Dividends

We paid no
cash dividends in 2004 or 2003 nor do we anticipate paying any cash dividends
at any time in the foreseeable future. 
We expect that earnings will be retained for the continued growth and
development of the business.  Future
dividends, if any, will depend upon our earnings, financial condition, cash
requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our Board
of Directors.

Stock Splits

In April 2003, the Board of Directors
approved a three-for-two split of our outstanding common shares effected in the
form of a 50% stock dividend.  The split
was paid on June 6, 2003 to shareholders of record as of May 16, 2003.  In February 2004, the Board of Directors
approved a second three-for-two split of our outstanding common shares effected
in the form of a 50% stock dividend. 
The split was paid on March 15, 2004 to shareholders of record as of February
23, 2004.

Buyback Program

During fiscal 2003, our Board of Directors
authorized a buyback program under which we can repurchase up to $350.0 million
of our common stock. Under the program, shares may be purchased as determined
by management, from time to time and within certain guidelines, in the open
market or in privately negotiated transactions, including privately negotiated
structured stock repurchase transactions and through transactions in the
options markets. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these
purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time
without prior notice.

Under the buyback program, we repurchased
approximately 1.9 million shares of our common stock for $12.4 million and 16.2
million shares of our common stock for $101.4 million, in the years ended March
31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  In
addition, approximately 1.7 million shares of common stock were acquired in the
year ended March 31, 2004 as a result of the settlement of $10.0 million of
structured stock repurchase transactions entered into in fiscal 2003.  As of March 31, 2004, we had no outstanding
structured stock repurchase transactions. 
These transactions are settled in cash or stock based on the market
price of our common stock on the date of the settlement.


Upon settlement, we either have our capital investment returned with a
premium or receive shares of our common stock, depending, respectively, on
whether the market price of our common stock is above or below a pre-determined
price agreed in connection with each such transaction.

Shareholders’
Rights Plan

On April 18, 2000, our Board of Directors
approved a shareholders rights plan (the “Rights Plan”).  Under the Rights Plan, each common
shareholder at the close of business on April 19, 2000 received a dividend of
one right for each share of common stock held. 
Each right represents the right to purchase one one-hundredths (1/100)
of a share of our Series A Junior Preferred Stock at an exercise price of
$40.00.  Initially, the rights are
represented by our common stock certificates and are neither exercisable nor
traded separately from our common stock. 
The rights will only become exercisable if a person or group acquires
15% or more of the common stock of Activision, or announces or commences a
tender or exchange offer which would result in the bidder’s beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of our common stock.

In the event that any person or group
acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, each holder of a right
(other than such person or members of such group) will thereafter have the
right to receive upon exercise of such right, in lieu of shares of Series A
Junior Preferred Stock, the number of shares of common stock of Activision
having a value equal to two times the then current exercise price of the
right.  If we are acquired in a merger
or other business combination transaction after a person has acquired 15% or
more of our common stock, each holder of a right will thereafter have the right
to receive upon exercise of such right a number of the acquiring company’s
common shares having a market value equal to two times the then current
exercise price of the right.  For
persons who, as of the close of business on April 18, 2000, beneficially own
15% or more of the common stock of Activision, the Rights Plan “grandfathers”
their current level of ownership, so long as they do not purchase additional
shares in excess of certain limitations.

We may redeem the rights for $.01 per right
at any time until the first public announcement of the acquisition of
beneficial ownership of 15% of our common stock.  At any time after a person has acquired 15% or more (but before
any person has acquired more than 50%) of our common stock, we may exchange all
or part of the rights for shares of common stock at an exchange ratio of one
share of common stock per right.  The
rights expire on April 18, 2010.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Our Business

We are a leading international publisher of
interactive entertainment software products. 
We have built a company with a diverse portfolio of products that spans
a wide range of categories and target markets and that is used on a variety of
game hardware platforms and operating systems. 
We have created, licensed and acquired a group of highly recognizable
brands, which we market to a variety of consumer demographics.

Our products cover game categories such as
action/adventure, action sports, racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person
action and strategy.  Our target
customer base ranges from game enthusiasts and children to mass-market
consumers and “value” buyers.  We
currently offer our products primarily in versions that operate on the Sony
PlayStation 2 (“PS2”), Nintendo GameCube (“GameCube”) and Microsoft Xbox
(“Xbox”) console systems, Nintendo Game Boy Advance (“GBA”) hand-held device
and the personal computer (“PC”).  The
installed base for this current generation of hardware platforms is significant
and growing.  We believe recent price
cuts in calendar 2004 on the Xbox and PS2 hardware should continue to drive the
growth of the installed base of these two platforms.  We also expect the installed base of the other current generation
platforms to continue to grow.  In
addition, Sony announced that it would be entering the hand-held hardware
market with the introduction of its hand-held gaming device, PlayStation
Portable (“PSP”).  PSP is currently
expected to be released in the United States toward the end of the first
quarter of calendar 2005.  Nintendo has
also announced that it plans to launch a new dual-screened, portable game
system, Nintendo Dual Screen (“NDS”), before the end of calendar 2004.  We are currently developing titles for the
PSP and the NDS with the objective of having one or more titles at launch for
each of these platforms.  We are also
planning to develop titles for the next generation console systems expected to
be developed by Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo for release in the next two to
three years.  Though there are still
many unknowns relating to these new platforms, our aim is to have a significant
presence at the launch of each new platform while being careful not to move away
too quickly from the current generation platforms given their large and growing
installed base.

Our publishing business involves the
development, marketing and sale of products directly, by license or through our
affiliate label program with certain third-party publishers.  In the United States, we primarily sell our
products on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics
stores, discount warehouses and game specialty stores.  We conduct our international publishing
activities through offices in the United Kingdom (“UK”), Germany, France,
Italy, Australia, Sweden, Canada and Japan. 
Our products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis,
through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements and through our
wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries.  Our distribution business consists of operations located in the
UK, the Netherlands and Germany that provide logistical and sales services to
third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own
publishing operations and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Our profitability is directly affected by the
mix of revenues from our publishing and distribution businesses. Operating
margins realized from our publishing business are substantially higher than
margins realized from our distribution business.  Operating margins in our publishing business are affected by our
ability to release highly successful or “hit” titles.  Though many of these titles have substantial production or
acquisition costs and marketing budgets, once a title recoups these costs,
incremental net revenues directly and positively impact our operating margin.
Operating margins in our distribution business are affected by the mix of
hardware and software sales, with software producing higher margins than hardware.

Our Focus

With respect to future game development, we
will continue to focus on our “big propositions,” products that are backed by
strong brands and high quality development, for which we will provide
significant marketing support.

A number of our fiscal 2005 “big
propositions” will include well-established brands, which are backed by
high-profile intellectual property and/or highly anticipated motion picture
releases.  Examples of these brands are
our superheroes and skateboarding brands. 
We have a long-term relationship with Marvel Enterprises through an
exclusive licensing agreement that expires in 2009.  This agreement grants us the exclusive rights to develop and
publish video games based on Marvel’s comic book franchises Spider-Man, X-MEN,
Fantastic Four and Iron Man.  Through
our long-term relationship with Spider-Man Merchandising, LLP, we have
completed the development of the video game

Spider-Man
2: The Movie

, the sequel to the highly successful

Spider-Man: The Movie

, a key fiscal 2003
title release that has continued to perform strongly into fiscal 2004.  The video game release of

Spider-Man 2: The


Movie

is scheduled to coincide with the
“Spider-Man 2” theatrical release in June 2004.  We also recently announced that through our licensing agreement
with Spider-Man Merchandising, LLP, we will be developing and publishing video
games based on Columbia Pictures/Marvel Enterprises, Inc.’s upcoming feature
film “Spider-Man 3,” which is expected to be released in May 2007.

In
addition, we have an exclusive licensing agreement with professional
skateboarder Tony Hawk that continues until 2015.  The agreement grants us exclusive rights to develop and publish
video games using Tony Hawk’s name and his likeness.  Through fiscal 2004, we have released five successful titles in
the Tony Hawk franchise with cumulative net revenues of over $800.0 million,
including the most recent,

Tony Hawk’s
Underground

, which was released in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.  We will continue to promote our
skateboarding franchise with the release in fiscal 2005 of the sequel to the
very successful

Tony Hawk’s Underground

.

We will also continue to develop new
intellectual properties such as

True Crime:
Streets of L.A.

and

Call of Duty

,
which were originally released in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.  These highly successful titles were both
ranked by third-party sales tracking agencies as among the top-five selling
games for the holiday season.  We expect
to develop a variety of games on multiple platforms based on these two new
original properties and hope to establish them as a source of recurring
revenues.  For example, in fiscal 2005,
we are scheduled to release

Call of
Duty:  Finest Hour

which will
be released on multiple console platforms.

We will also continue to evaluate emerging
brands that we believe have potential to become successful game
franchises.  For example, we have a
multi-year, multi-property, publishing agreement with DreamWorks SKG that
grants us the exclusive rights to publish video games based on DreamWorks SKG’s
theatrical release “Shrek 2,” as well as upcoming computer-animated films,
“Shark Tale,” “Madagascar” and “Over the Hedge,” and their sequels.  We also have an exclusive licensing agreement
to develop and publish video games for the best-selling children’s book series,
“Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events” which is being developed for
a feature film by Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon Movies and DreamWorks SKG.

In addition to acquiring or creating high
profile intellectual property, we have also continued our focus on establishing
and maintaining relationships with talented and experienced software
development teams.  We have strengthened
our internal development capabilities through the acquisition in prior fiscal
years of a number of talented and experienced development companies.  Most recently, in October 2003, we exercised
our option to acquire the remaining 70% of the outstanding capital of Infinity
Ward, the developer of our PC title,

Call of
Duty.

We had acquired the
initial 30% of Infinity Ward’s outstanding capital stock in May 2002. We also
have development agreements with other top-level, third-party developers such
as id Software, Valve Corporation, Spark Unlimited, Lionhead Studios and The
Creative Assembly.

We are utilizing these
developer relationships, new intellectual property acquisitions, new original
intellectual property creations and our existing library of intellectual
property to further focus our game development on product lines that will
deliver significant, lasting and recurring revenues and operating profits.

Critical Accounting Policies

We have
identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the
understanding of our financial results. 
The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our
business operations is discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies
affect our reported and expected financial results.  For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other
accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8.  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition.

We
recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of title and
risk of loss to our customers.  Revenue
from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for
returns and price protection.  With
respect to license agreements that provide customers the right to make multiple
copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenue is recognized upon delivery
of such copies. Per copy royalties on sales that exceed the guarantee are
recognized as earned.  In addition, in
order to recognize revenue for both product sales and licensing transactions,
persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection of the related
receivable must be probable.  Revenue
recognition also determines the timing of certain expenses, including cost of
sales – intellectual property licenses and cost of sales – software royalties
and amortization.


Allowances for Returns, Price Protection,
Doubtful Accounts and Inventory Obsolescence.

In determining the appropriate unit shipments
to our customers, we benchmark our titles using historical and industry data. We closely monitor and analyze the historical
performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by
other publishers and the anticipated timing of other releases in order to
assess future demands of current and upcoming titles.  Initial volumes shipped upon title launch
and subsequent reorders are evaluated to ensure that quantities are sufficient
to meet the demands from the retail markets but at the same time, are
controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel.

We may permit
product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain
conditions.  In general, price
protection refers to the circumstances when we elect to decrease the wholesale
price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and applicable, allows
customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to Activision with
respect to open and/or future invoices. 
The conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return
products or price protection are, among other things, compliance with
applicable payment terms, delivery to us of weekly inventory and sell-through
reports, and consistent participation in the launches of our premium title
releases.  We may also consider other
factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market
factors. Management must make estimates of potential future product returns and
price protection related to current period product revenue.  We estimate the amount of future returns and
price protection for current period product revenue utilizing historical
experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and
acceptance of our products by the end consumer.  The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future
returns and price protection for a particular title:  historical performance of titles in similar genres, historical
performance of the hardware platform, historical performance of the brand,
console hardware lifecycle, Activision sales force and retail customer
feedback, industry pricing, weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory, absolute
quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory, Activision warehouse on-hand
inventory levels, the title’s recent sell-through history (if available),
marketing trade programs and competing titles. 
The relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending
upon, among other items, genre, platform, seasonality and sales strategy.  Significant management judgments and
estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance
for returns and price protection in any accounting period.  Historically, total actual returns and price
protection have not exceeded our allowance estimates.  However, actual returns and price protection could vary materially
from our allowance estimates due to a number of reasons including, among others,
a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the same period of a
similarly themed title by a competitor, or technological obsolescence due to
the emergence of new hardware platforms. 
Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue
for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different
estimates in determining the allowances for returns and price protection.

Similarly,
management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable.  In estimating the allowance for doubtful
accounts, we analyze the age of current outstanding account balances,
historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness,
current economic trends and changes in our customers’ payment terms and their
economic condition, as well as whether we can obtain sufficient credit
insurance.  Any significant changes in
any of these criteria would impact management’s estimates in establishing our
allowance for doubtful accounts.

We value
inventory at the lower of cost or market. 
We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and in the retail
channel and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on the
future expected demand for our products. Significant changes in demand for our
products would impact management’s estimates in establishing our inventory
provision.

Software Development Costs.

Software
development costs include payments made to independent software developers
under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for internally
developed products.

We account for software development costs in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.”  Software development costs are capitalized
once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are
determined to be recoverable. 
Technological feasibility of a product encompasses both technical design
documentation and game design documentation. 
For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the
development cycle. Technological feasibility is evaluated on a
product-by-product basis.  Prior to a
product’s release, we expense, as part of cost of sales – software royalties
and amortization, capitalized costs when we believe such amounts are not
recoverable.  Capitalized costs for
those products that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product
development expense in the period of cancellation.  Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized
are charged immediately to product development expense.  We evaluate the future recoverability of


capitalized amounts on a quarterly
basis.  The recoverability of capitalized software development costs is evaluated
based on the expected performance of the specific products for which the costs
relate.

Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance
include: historical performance of comparable products using comparable
technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and estimated
performance of a sequel product based on the performance of the product on
which the sequel is based.

Commencing
upon product release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to
cost of sales – software royalties and amortization based on the ratio of
current revenues to total projected revenues, generally resulting in an
amortization period of six months or less. 
For products that have been released in prior periods, we evaluate the
future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.  The primary evaluation criterion is actual
title performance.

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological
feasibility is established, as well as in the ongoing assessment of the
recoverability of capitalized costs.  In
evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected
product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of
additional development costs to be incurred. 
If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than and/or
revised forecasted or actual costs are greater than the original forecasted
amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the actual impairment
charge may be larger than originally estimated in any given quarter.

Intellectual Property Licenses.

Intellectual property license costs
represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of
their trademarks, copyrights, software, technology or other intellectual
property or proprietary rights in the development of our products.  Depending upon the agreement with the rights
holder, we may obtain the rights to use acquired intellectual property in multiple
products over multiple years, or alternatively, for a single product.

We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized intellectual
property licenses on a quarterly basis. 
The recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs is
evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products in which
the licensed trademark or copyright is to be used.  As many of our intellectual property licenses extend for multiple
products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized
intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors such
as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the
intellectual property, whether there are any future planned theatrical releases
or television series based on the intellectual property and the rights holder’s
continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property.  Prior to the related product’s release, we
expense, as part of cost of sales – intellectual property licenses, capitalized
intellectual property costs when we believe such amounts are not
recoverable.  Capitalized intellectual
property costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned are charged
to product development expense in the period of cancellation.  Criteria used to evaluate expected product
performance include: historical performance of comparable products using
comparable technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and
estimated performance of a sequel product based on the performance of the
product on which the sequel is based.

Commencing
upon the related product’s release, capitalized intellectual property license
costs are amortized to cost of sales – intellectual property licenses based on
the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected
revenues for all products in which the licensed property will be utilized.  As intellectual property license contracts
may extend for multiple years, the amortization of capitalized intellectual
property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one
year.  For intellectual property
included in products that have been released, we evaluate the future
recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.  The primary evaluation criterion is actual
title performance.

Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the
assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs.

In evaluating the
recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product
performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional
development costs to be incurred.  If
revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than and/or revised
forecasted or actual costs are greater than the original forecasted amounts
utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the actual impairment charge
may be larger than originally estimated in any given quarter.  Additionally, as noted above, as many of our
intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple
years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property
license costs based on certain qualitative factors such as the success of other
products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property,
whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series
based on the intellectual property and the rights holder’s continued promotion
and exploitation of the intellectual property. 
Material differences may result in the amount and timing of charges for
any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different
estimates in evaluating these qualitative factors.


Selected Consolidated Statements of
Operations Data

The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of
operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of consolidated net
revenues and also breaks down net revenues by territory and platform, as well
as operating income by business segment:


Results of Operations
– Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2004 and 2003

Net income for the year ended March 31, 2004
was $77.7 million or $0.54 per diluted share, as compared to $66.2 million or
$0.43 per diluted share for the year ended March 31, 2003.

Net Revenues

We primarily derive revenue
from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on video
game consoles (such as the PS2, Xbox and GameCube), PCs and hand-held game
devices (such as the GBA).  We also
derive revenue from our distribution business in Europe that provides
logistical and sales services to third-party publishers of interactive
entertainment software, our own publishing operations and third-party
manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

The following table details our consolidated net revenues by business
segment and our publishing net revenues by territory for the years ended March
31, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands):

Consolidated net revenues increased 10% from $864.1 million for the
year ended March 31, 2003 to $947.7 million for the year ended March 31,
2004.  This increase was generated by
both our publishing and distribution businesses.  The increase in consolidated net revenue was driven by the
following:

•

Strong
performance of our fiscal 2004 third quarter releases of

True Crime: Streets of L.A.

and

Tony Hawk’s Underground

for the PS2, Xbox
and GameCube

and

Call of Duty

for the PC. We continued to
see strong sales of these titles through March 2004

.

In addition, we
had strong results from several other titles released during fiscal 2004
including,

Return to Castle Wolfenstein, X2:
Wolverine’s Revenge, Cabela’s Dangerous Hunts, Cabela’s Deer Hunt 2004 Season,

and
in select European markets,

Jedi Knight:
Jedi Academy.

We also had
strong catalog sales from a number of our franchises, including
Spider-Man.  Catalog sales are sales of
titles released prior to the current fiscal year.

•

Publishing
console net revenues increased by 9% from $466.1 million for the year ended
March 31, 2003 to $508.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2004.  As expected, within the mix of specific
consoles, net revenues from the sale of software for the prior generation
console hardware systems, such as PS1, continued to decline while the net
revenues from the sale of software for the current generation of console
hardware systems continued to grow.

•

Net revenues
were positively impacted from titles selling at higher average retail prices
throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003.  As a result of the strong performance of our key fiscal 2004
releases, we were able to maintain the original price points for those titles
for an extended period of time.

•

International
net revenues benefited from the strong year-over-year strengthening of the Euro
(“EUR”) and Great British Pound (“GBP”) in relation to the U.S. dollar.  We estimate that foreign exchange rates
increased reported net revenue by approximately $52.1 million.  Excluding the impact of changing foreign
currency rates, our international net revenue increased 4% year-over-year.

•

The increase in publishing
net revenues was offset by fewer titles released in fiscal 2004 as compared to
fiscal 2003.

International publishing net revenues
increased by 19% from $183.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2003, to
$218.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2004.  International publishing also saw strong results from our 2004
releases of

True Crime: Streets of L.A.

and

Tony Hawk’s Underground

for the
PS2, Xbox and GameCube

and

Call of Duty

for the PC

.

We
also had strong results from several other titles released during fiscal 2004
including,

Return to Castle Wolfenstein, X2:
Wolverine’s Revenge

and

Jedi
Knight: Jedi Academy.

In
addition, we had strong catalog sales from a number of our franchises,
including Spider-Man.  There also was a
positive strengthening of the EUR and the GBP in relation to the U.S. dollar of
approximately $22.2 million.  Excluding
the impact of changing foreign currency rates, our international publishing net
revenue increased 7% year-over-year. 
The increase in net revenues was offset by fewer titles released in
fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003.

Net revenue
from sales of titles for the PC increased 33% from $99.9 million for the year
ended March 31, 2003 to $132.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2004.  Though the number of premium PC titles
released in fiscal 2004 remained relatively consistent with fiscal 2003,
certain of our fiscal 2004 releases,

Call of
Duty, Empires: Dawn of the Modern World

and, in select European
markets,

,
performed very well in both the domestic and international markets.  According to NPD Group, a third-party sales
tracking agency,

Call of Duty

was
the number one selling PC title in North America during the quarter of its
release, our third quarter of fiscal 2004. 
We expect fiscal 2005 PC publishing net revenues to increase as a
percentage of total publishing net revenues over fiscal 2004 reflecting the
release of more PC titles in fiscal 2005, including the highly anticipated

Doom 3

in fiscal 2004 to 10 from 13 in fiscal 2003, we were able to increase our PS2
sales in both the domestic and international markets.  The increase is primarily due to strong, worldwide sales of several
of our PS2 titles including

True Crime:
Streets of L.A., Tony Hawk’s Underground, X2: Wolverine’s Revenge, Return to
Castle Wolfenstein, Cabela’s Dangerous Hunts

and

Cabela’s Deer Hunt 2004 Season.

We expect the growth of the
installed base of PS2 hardware to be driven by the recent price cut announced
by Sony in May 2004.

remained relatively consistent from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004, we were able to
increase our Xbox sales in both the domestic and international markets.  The increase is primarily due to strong
worldwide sales of several of our Xbox titles including

Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Soldier of Fortune 2, X2: Wolverine’s Revenge,
Tenchu: Return from Darkness

and, in select European markets,

Net revenue from sales of titles for the Sony PlayStation console system
(“PS1”) for the year ended March 31, 2004 decreased 60% from the prior fiscal
year, from $52.7 million to $20.8 million. 
The decrease was expected due to the market transition away from the
prior generation of hardware platforms, such as PS1, to the current generation
console systems.  We expect sales of PS1
products to continue to decline in fiscal 2005.

Net revenue from sales of titles for the GBA for the year ended March
31, 2004 decreased 44% from the prior fiscal year, from $44.1 million to $24.6
million.  This is due to a decrease in
the number of GBA games released year-over-year.  In fiscal 2003, we released 11 GBA titles, whereas in fiscal 2004
we released 4 GBA titles.  We expect the
hand-held installed base to grow with the release of the NDS and PSP which are
expected to launch in late calendar year 2004 and early calendar year 2005,
respectively.  In addition, in fiscal
2005, as the GBA hardware approaches the peak of its life cycle, we expect to
increase our focus on developing GBA games for mass-market consumers.

The platform mix of our future publishing net
revenues will likely be impacted by a number of factors, including the ability
of hardware manufacturers to continue to increase their installed hardware
base, the introduction of new hardware platforms, as well as the timing of key
product releases from our product release schedule.  We expect that net revenues from console titles will continue to
represent the largest component of our publishing net revenues with PS2 having
the largest percentage of that business due to its larger installed hardware
base.  We expect net revenues from
hand-held titles to remain the smallest component of our publishing net
revenues.  However, if the PSP and/or
the NDS hand-held devices are introduced in fiscal 2005, we may see an increase
in our hand-held business in comparison to prior periods.  Our net revenues from PC titles will be
primarily driven by our product release schedule.

A significant portion of our revenues and
profits are derived from a relatively small number of popular titles and brands
each year as revenues and profits are significantly affected by our ability to
release highly successful or “hit” titles. 
For example, for the year ended March 31, 2004, 28% of our consolidated
net revenues and 40% of worldwide publishing net revenues were derived from net
revenues from our

Tony Hawk’s Underground

and

True Crime: Streets of L.A.

titles.  Though many of these titles
have substantial production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets, once a
title recoups these costs, incremental net revenues directly and positively
impact operating profits resulting in a disproportionate amount of operating
income being derived from these select titles. 
We expect that a limited number of titles and brands will continue to
produce a disproportionately large amount of our net revenues and profits.

Two factors that could affect future
publishing and distribution net revenue performance are console hardware
pricing and software pricing.  As
console hardware moves through its life cycle, hardware manufacturers typically
enact price reductions.  Reductions in
the price of console hardware typically result in an increase in the installed
base of hardware owned by consumers. 
Price cuts on Xbox and PS2 hardware were announced in March and May
2004, respectively.  Historically, we
have also seen that lower console hardware prices put downward pressure


on software
pricing.  While we expect console
software launch pricing for most genres to hold at $49.99 through the calendar
2004 holidays, we believe we could see additional software price declines
thereafter.

Distribution net revenues for the year ended
March 31, 2004 increased 14% from the prior fiscal year, from $248.1 million to
$281.9 million.  The increase was
primarily due to the positive impact of the year-over-year strengthening of the
EUR and the GBP in relation to the U.S. dollar.  Excluding the impact of the changing foreign currency rates, our
distribution net revenue was in line with our prior fiscal year, with a slight
increase of 2% year-over-year.  The mix
of distribution net revenues between hardware and software sales varied
year-over-year with approximately  28%
hardware in the year ended March 31, 2004 as compared to 38% hardware in the
prior fiscal year.  This is mainly
attributed to an increase in business with large, mass-market customers that
generate a higher percentage of sales from software.  In both fiscal years, hardware sales were principally comprised
of sales of console hardware.  The mix
of future distribution net revenues will be driven by a number of factors
including the occurrence of further hardware price reductions instituted by
hardware manufacturers, the introduction of new hardware platforms and our
ability to establish and maintain distribution agreements with hardware
manufacturers and third-party software publishers.  We are expecting our fiscal 2005 distribution results to be in
line with fiscal 2004.

Cost of sales – product costs represented 50%
and 51% of consolidated net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively.  In absolute
dollars, cost of sales – product costs increased due to higher sales volume in
fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. 
There were two primary factors that affected cost of sales – product
costs as a percentage of consolidated net revenues:

•

The
product mix of our publishing business for the year ended March 31, 2004
reflects a lower proportion of net revenues from titles for hand-held devices,
as compared to the year ended March 31, 2003. 
Titles for hand-held devices generally have the highest manufacturing
per unit cost of all platforms.

•

Due
to the lower manufacturing costs for PC titles, we were able to benefit from
the strong sales of

Call of Duty

for the year ended March 31, 2004.

We expect cost of sales – product costs as a
percentage of net revenue to decrease primarily due to a lower percentage of
revenue generated from our distribution business in fiscal 2005, which is a lower
margin business.  We may also receive a
benefit from changes in product mix in fiscal 2005 due to an increase in PC
publishing net revenues as a percentage of total publishing net revenues and
the focus on “big proposition” titles, for which we could benefit from volume
discounts.

We expect cost of sales – intellectual property licenses to increase in
fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004, as we expect to have more titles

expenses for the year ended March 31, 2004 also increased from the prior fiscal
year, from $57.0 million to $97.9 million. 
The increase in product development as a percentage of publishing net
revenues and in absolute dollars resulted from:

•

A
$21 million game cancellation charge recorded in the fiscal 2004 third quarter.  We executed a realignment of our product
portfolio driven by the evolution of the video game market, which is
increasingly dominated by high quality products that are based on recognizable
franchises and supported with big marketing programs.  We completed a comprehensive review of our product portfolio in
which we evaluated each product based on a number of criteria, including:  the strength of the franchise, the projected
product quality, the potential responsiveness of the product to aggressive marketing
support and the financial risk in the event of product failure.  As a result of this review, we believe that
we have an extensive slate of high-potential properties in development.  However, we found that certain projects had
a lower likelihood of achieving acceptable levels of operating performance and
that continued pursuit of these projects would create a substantial opportunity
cost as it related to our slate of high-potential projects. Accordingly, in the
three months ended December 31, 2003, we cancelled the development of ten
products that we believed were


unlikely to produce an acceptable level of
return on our investment.  In connection
with the cancellation of these products, we recorded a pre-tax charge of
approximately $21 million.

•

Our
increased emphasis on product quality and the lengthening of product
development schedules.  To maintain the
competitiveness of our products and to take advantage of increasingly
sophisticated technology associated with new hardware platforms, we have
increased the amount of time spent play-testing new products, conducted more
extensive product quality evaluations and lengthened product development
schedules to allow time to make the improvements indicated by our testing and
evaluations.  We are focused on improved
game quality, and in many cases, this has resulted in an increase in product
development costs.

•

The
increase in absolute dollars is also due to an increase in studio employee
incentive compensation as a result of the strong performances of key fiscal
2004 title releases.

Sales and marketing expenses of $128.2

dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2004
from the prior fiscal year was primarily generated by our publishing business
as a result of significant marketing programs, including television and
in-theatre ad campaigns and in-store promotions, run in support of our three
key fiscal 2004 third quarter title releases,

Tony

The income tax provision of $38.3 million for
the year ended March 31, 2004 reflects our effective income tax rate of
33%.  The significant items that
generated the variance between our effective rate and our statutory rate of 35%
were research and development tax credits and the impact of foreign tax rate
differentials, partially offset by an increase in our deferred tax asset
valuation allowance and state taxes. 
The realization of deferred tax assets depends primarily on the
generation of future taxable income.  We
believe that it is more likely than not that we will generate taxable income
sufficient to realize the benefit of net deferred tax assets recognized.

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 increased 10% from the
prior fiscal year, from $786.4 million to $864.1 million.  This increase was generated by our
publishing business and, to a lesser degree, our distribution business.

There were several factors that affected the
fiscal 2003 net revenue performance of our publishing business.  First, positively impacting our performance,
was an improvement in console sales. Our publishing console net revenues for
the year ended March 31, 2003 increased 49% from the prior fiscal year, from
$313.0 million to $466.1 million. 
Fiscal 2003 publishing console net revenues reflect the simultaneous
cross-platform, multi-national releases of

Spider-Man: The Movie

in the first quarter
and

Tony
Hawk’s Pro Skater 4

in the third quarter.  In addition publishing console net revenue performance was also
driven by the following releases:

Tenchu:
Wrath of Heaven, Street Hoops

and

Cabela’s
Big Game Hunter

for PS2. 
Second, publishing hand-held net revenues for the year ended March 31,
2003 decreased by 58% from the prior fiscal year, from $119.2 million to $50.0
million.  This decrease reflects the
fact that the GBA hardware was launched in June 2001.  Our GBA software sales for the year ended March 31, 2002
benefited from the related hardware launch. 
We also released fewer titles for the hand-held platforms in fiscal 2003
- - eleven titles, in comparison to nineteen titles in fiscal 2002.  Additionally, the average retail price of
titles for hand-held devices was lower in fiscal 2003 than in fiscal 2002.  Third, PC net revenues for the year ended
March 31, 2003 decreased 15% from the prior fiscal year, from $117.3 million to
$99.9 million.  Though the number of PC
titles released in fiscal 2003 was relatively consistent with fiscal 2002,
during fiscal 2002, we released

Return to
Castle Wolfenstein

for the PC, which was one of our top performing
titles of fiscal 2002.  PC net revenues
for the year ended March 31, 2002 reflect that title’s worldwide, strong
performance.  Lastly, net revenues from
our international publishing business for the year ended March 31, 2003
benefited by approximately $14.1 million from a year-over-year strengthening of
the EUR and the GBP in relation to the U.S. dollar.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, our
domestic publishing business and our international publishing business
experienced similar year-over-year improvements for the reasons detailed above.

A significant portion of our revenues and
profits are derived from a relatively small number of popular titles and brands
each year as revenues and profits are significantly affected by our ability to
release highly successful or “hit” titles. 
For example, for the year ended March 31, 2003, 30% of our consolidated
net revenues and 43% of worldwide publishing net revenues were derived from net
revenues from our

Spider-Man:  The Movie

and

Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4

titles.  Though many of these titles have substantial
production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets, once a title recoups
these costs, incremental net revenues directly and positively impacts operating
profits resulting in a disproportionate amount of operating income being
derived from these select titles.  We
expect


that a limited
number of titles and brands will continue to produce a disproportionately large
amount of our net revenues and profits.

Distribution net revenues for the year ended
March 31, 2003 increased 5% from the prior fiscal year, from $236.9 million to
$248.1 million.  The increase was due to
the positive impact of the year-over-year strengthening of the EUR and the GBP
in relation to the U.S. dollar. 
Distribution console net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 also
benefited from the international hardware launches of Xbox and GameCube in
March 2002 and May 2002, respectively. 
It additionally benefited from the price reduction on PS2 hardware that
was effective September 2001, as this resulted in both an increase in sales of
PS2 hardware, as well as an increase in sales of PS2 software due to the
corresponding larger installed hardware base. 
This increase was partially offset by declines in distribution hand-held
and PC net revenues for the reasons detailed in the discussion of publishing
net revenues.  The mix of distribution
net revenues between hardware and software sales remained relatively constant
year-over-year at approximately 38% hardware and 62% software.

Domestic net revenues increased 7% from
$404.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2002, to $432.3 million for the
year ended March 31, 2003 for the reasons detailed above in the discussion of
our publishing business net revenues. 
International net revenues increased by 13% from $381.5 million for the
year ended March 31, 2002, to $431.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2003
for the reasons detailed above in the discussion of our publishing business, as
well as the result of the year-over-year strengthening of the EUR and the GBP
in relation to the U.S. dollar.

Cost of sales – product costs represented 51%
and 56% of consolidated net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively.  There were two
primary factors that affected cost of sales – product costs as a percentage of
consolidated net revenues.  First, the
product mix of our publishing business for the year ended March 31, 2003
reflects a lower proportion of net revenues from titles for hand-held devices,
as compared to the year ended March 31, 2002. 
Titles for hand-held devices generally have the highest manufacturing
per unit cost of all platforms.  Second,
our manufacturing costs for console titles for the year ended March 31, 2003
benefited from the economies of scale due to the high volume of

Spider-Man:
The Movie

units manufactured.

Cost of sales – software royalties and

software royalties and amortization for the year ended March 31, 2003 also
increased from the prior fiscal year, from $58.9 million to $79.2 million.  The increases reflect the change in the
product mix of our publishing business. 
Though titles for hand-held devices generally have the highest per unit
manufacturing cost of all platforms, they have the lowest product development
cost structure.  In the year ended March
31, 2002 in which titles for hand-held devices accounted for a higher
proportion of publishing net revenues, the related cost of sales – software
royalties and amortization was correspondingly low.  This is in comparison to the year ended March 31, 2003 in which
console


titles accounted for a higher proportion of
publishing net revenues.  Console titles
such as PS2, Xbox and GameCube have high product development cost structures,
and the release of titles on these platforms will result in a correspondingly
high cost of sales – software royalties and amortization.  In addition, we recorded during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 approximately $8.0 million related to an assessment of
the recoverability of capitalized development costs pertaining to certain
products.

recorded an approximate $7.0 million related to an assessment of the
recoverability of certain of our investments in long-term licensing
agreements.  We recorded additional
costs relating to common stock warrants issued in connection with those
licensing agreements.  The impact of
these costs was partially offset by the fact that one of our top performing
titles released in fiscal 2002 had a higher intellectual property royalty rate
structure than the majority of the top performing titles released in fiscal
2003.

Product development expenses for the year

expense for the year ended March 31, 2003 also increased from the prior fiscal
year, from $41.0 million to $57.0 million. 
These increases reflect the change in the product mix of titles in
development - more console and less hand-held - during fiscal 2003.  The cost to develop titles for current
console systems, such as PS2, Xbox and GameCube, is higher than the cost to
develop titles for the legacy console systems and hand-held devices.  Additionally, we had more titles in
development during fiscal 2003 than fiscal 2002.  Lastly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we decided to
eliminate certain smaller and non-core projects from our future development
plan.  The cost relating to the
cancellation of those titles was approximately $2.6 million.

Sales and marketing expenses of $100.6

for the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  The increase in sales and marketing expense
dollars for the year ended March 31, 2003 from the prior fiscal year was the
result of increased costs in both our publishing and distribution
businesses.  The increase in sales and
marketing expense dollars in our publishing business


was the result of a significant marketing
program in support of the simultaneous cross-platform, multi-national release
of

Spider-Man:  The Movie

during the first
quarter of fiscal 2003, as well as increased TV and print ads in support of
second, third and fourth quarter releases such as

Street Hoops, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4

and

Tenchu:  Wrath
of Heaven

.  Additionally, in
the year ended March 31, 2003, we provided sponsorship for select action sports
tours/tournaments in support of our Activision action sports brands.  The increase in sales and marketing expense
dollars in our distribution business was due to an increasing percentage of our
distribution business being generated from large national accounts.  Such large national accounts generally
result in increased sales costs.

increased $2.5 million from the prior fiscal year, from $44.0 million to $46.5

consolidated net revenues, general and administrative expenses remained
relatively constant year-over-year at approximately 5% to 6% as a result of our
continued focus on building operating efficiencies and controlling costs.  The increase in absolute dollars was primarily
due to the incurrence in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 of an approximate
$2.0 million charge for the relocation of our UK distribution facility due to
the increased growth of our UK distribution and UK publishing businesses.

Operating Income (in thousands)

Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2003 was $94.8 million,
compared to $80.6 million in the prior fiscal year.  The increase reflects improvements in both our publishing and
distribution businesses.  Publishing
operating income improvement reflects, as previously discussed, the benefits
generated by the release of hit titles, the decrease in cost of sales – product
costs due to changes in product mix and our continued focus on building
operating efficiencies and controlling costs. Distribution operating income
improvement includes the distribution of a very successful third-party
publisher’s title in several countries and reductions in headcount related
expenses.

The income tax provision of $37.2 million for the year ended March 31,
2003 reflects our effective income tax rate of 36%.  The significant items that generated the variance between our
effective rate and our statutory rate of 35% were state taxes and an increase
in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, partially offset by research and
development tax credits and the impact of foreign tax rate differentials.  The realization of deferred tax assets
depends primarily on the generation of future taxable income.  We believe that it is more likely than not
that we will generate taxable income sufficient to realize the benefit of net
deferred tax assets recognized.

Quarterly Operating
Results

Our quarterly operating results have in the past varied significantly
and will likely vary significantly in the future, depending on numerous
factors, several of which are not under our control.  See Item 1 “Business – Factors Affecting Future
Performance.”  Our business also has
experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant seasonality,
largely due to consumer buying patterns and our product release schedule
focusing on those patterns.  Net
revenues typically are significantly higher during the fourth calendar quarter,
primarily due to the increased demand for consumer software during the year-end
holiday buying season.  Accordingly, we
believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not
necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future
performance.

The following table is a comparative breakdown of our quarterly results
for the immediately preceding eight quarters (amounts in thousands, except per
share data):

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

As of March
31, 2004, our primary source of liquidity is comprised of $466.6 million of
cash and cash equivalents and $121.1 million of short-term investments.  Over the last three years, our primary
sources of liquidity have included cash on hand at the beginning of the year
and cash flows generated from continuing operations.  We have also generated significant cash flows from the issuance
of our common stock to employees through the exercise of options and to the
public through an underwritten public offering in fiscal 2003, as well as from
the utilization of structured stock repurchase transactions, which are
described in more detail below in “Cash Flows from Financing Activities.”  In recent years, we have not utilized debt
financing as a significant source of cash flows.  However, we do have available at certain of our international
locations, credit facilities, which are described below in “Credit Facilities,”
that can be utilized if needed.

In August 2003, we filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission two amended shelf registration statements, including
the base prospectuses therein. The first shelf registration statement, on Form
S-3, allows us, at any time, to offer any combination of securities described
in the base prospectus in one or more offerings with an aggregate initial
offering price of up to $500,000,000. 
Unless we state otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, we
expect to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities for general
corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital, repayment
or reduction of long-term and short-term debt and the financing of acquisitions
and other business combinations. We may invest funds that we do not immediately
require in marketable securities.

The second shelf registration statement, on
Form S-4, allows us, at any time, to offer any combination of securities
described in the base prospectus in one or more offerings with an aggregate
initial offering price of up to $250,000,000 in connection with our acquisition
of the assets, business or securities of other companies whether by purchase,
merger, or any other form of business combination.

We believe
that we have sufficient working capital ($675.8 million at March 31, 2004), as
well as proceeds available from our international credit facilities, to finance
our operational requirements for at least the next twelve months, including
purchases of inventory and equipment, the funding of the development,
production, marketing and sale of new products and the acquisition of
intellectual property rights for future products from third parties.

Cash Flows from
Operating Activities

In recent
years, the primary drivers of cash flows from operating activities typically
have included the collection of customer receivables generated by the sale of
our products, offset by payments to vendors for the manufacture, distribution
and marketing of our products, third-party developers and intellectual property
holders and our own employees.  A
significant operating use of our cash relates to our continued investment in
software development and intellectual property licenses.  We spent approximately $115.2 million and
$151.6 million in the years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in
connection with the acquisition of publishing or distribution


rights for products being developed by third
parties, the execution of new license agreements granting us long-term rights
to intellectual property of third parties, as well as the capitalization of
product development costs relating to internally developed products.  We expect that we will continue to make
significant expenditures relating to our investment in software development and
intellectual property licenses.  Our
future cash commitments relating to these investments are detailed below in
“Commitments.”  Cash flows from operations
are affected by our ability to release highly successful or “hit” titles.  Though many of these titles have substantial
production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets, once a title recoups
these costs, incremental net revenues typically will directly and positively
impact cash flows.

The principal components comprising cash
flows from operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2004, included
favorable operating results and increases in accounts payable, partially offset
by increases in accounts receivable and our continued investment in software
development and intellectual property licenses.  See an analysis of the change in key balance sheet accounts below
in “Key Balance Sheet Accounts.”  We
expect that a primary source of future liquidity, both short-term and
long-term, will be the result of cash flows from continuing operations.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

In recent years, the primary drivers of cash
used in investing activities typically have included capital expenditures,
acquisitions of privately held interactive software development companies and
the net effect of purchases and sales/maturities of short-term investment
vehicles.  The goal of our short-term
investments is to maximize return while minimizing risk, maintaining liquidity,
coordinating with anticipated working capital needs and providing for prudent
investment diversification.

For the year ended March 31, 2004, cash flows
used in investing activities were primarily the result of capital expenditures
and the utilization of approximately $3.5 million of cash to acquire the
privately held interactive software development company, Infinity Ward.  We have historically financed our
acquisitions through the issuance of shares of common stock or a combination of
common stock and cash. We will continue to evaluate potential acquisition
candidates as to the benefit they bring to us.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

In recent years, the primary drivers of cash
provided by financing activities have related to transactions involving our
common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees and
the public, the purchase of treasury shares, as well as the use of structured
stock repurchase transactions.  In
recent years, we have not utilized debt financing as a significant source of cash
flows.  However, we do have available at
certain of our international locations, credit facilities, which are described
below in “Credit Facilities,” that can be utilized if needed.

The cash provided by financing activities for
the year ended March 31, 2004, primarily is the result of the maturity of
structured stock repurchase transactions, partially offset by cash used to
purchase treasury stock and enter into additional structured stock repurchase
transactions.  During fiscal 2003, our
Board of Directors authorized a buyback program under which we can repurchase
up to $350.0 million of our common stock. Under the program, shares may be
purchased as determined by management and within certain guidelines, from time
to time, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including
privately negotiated structured stock repurchase transactions and through
transactions in the options markets. Depending on market conditions and other
factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time
to time without prior notice.  In the
past, we have entered into structured stock repurchase transactions that were
settled in cash or stock based on the market price of our common stock on the
date of the settlement. Upon settlement, we either had our capital investment
returned with a premium or received shares of our common stock, depending,
respectively, on whether the market price of our common stock was above or
below a pre-determined price agreed in connection with each such
transaction.  As of March 31, 2004, we
had approximately $226.2 million available for utilization under the buyback
program and no outstanding structured stock repurchase transactions. We
actively manage our capital structure and balance sheet as a component of our
overall business strategy.  Accordingly,
in the future, when we determine that market conditions are appropriate, we may
seek to achieve long term value for the shareholders through, among other
things, new debt or equity financings or refinancings, share repurchases and
other transactions involving our equity or debt securities.


Key Balance Sheet Accounts

Accounts Receivable

The increase in gross accounts receivable was
primarily the result of:

•

Higher sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004 over the prior year quarter due to the continued strong sales of our key
third quarter fiscal 2004 releases,

True Crime: 
Streets of L.A.

,

Tony Hawk’s

and

Call of Duty

and an increase in the number of titles
released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 (

Tenchu: Return from Darkness

on Xbox and

Pitfall: The Lost Expedition

and

MTX: Mototrax

on multiple platforms) over the prior year
quarter (

Tenchu:  Wrath of Heaven

on PS2).

•

A significant increase in business of our UK
distribution facility with large, mass-market customers.  Large, mass-market customers typically have
longer trading terms than smaller, independent accounts.

Reserves for returns, price
protection and bad debt decreased from $57.4 million at March 31, 2003 to $47.0
million at March 31, 2004, primarily due to the strong sell through to end
consumers of our key third quarter fiscal 2004 releases.

Credit Facilities

We have revolving credit facilities with our Centresoft subsidiary
located in the UK (the “UK Facility”) and our NBG subsidiary located in Germany
(the “German Facility”).  The UK
Facility provided Centresoft with the ability to borrow up to GBP 8.0 million
($14.6 million), including issuing letters of credit, on a revolving basis as
of March 31, 2004. Furthermore, under the UK Facility, Centresoft provided a
GBP 0.3 million ($0.5 million) guarantee for the benefit of our CD Contact
subsidiary as of March 31, 2004.  The UK
Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.0% as of March 31, 2004, is
collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and expires
in November 2004.  The UK Facility also
contains various covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified
financial ratios related to, among others, fixed charges.  As of March 31, 2004, we were in compliance
with these covenants.  No borrowings
were outstanding against the UK Facility as of March 31, 2004.  The German Facility provided for revolving
loans up to EUR 0.5 million ($0.6 million) as of March 31, 2004, bore interest
at a Eurocurrency rate plus 2.5%, is collateralized by certain of the
subsidiary’s property and equipment and has no expiration date.  No borrowings were outstanding against the
German Facility as of March 31, 2004.

Commitments

In the normal course of business, we enter
into contractual arrangements with third parties for the development of
products, as well as for the rights to intellectual property.  Under these agreements, we commit to provide
specified payments to a developer or intellectual property holder, based upon
contractual arrangements. Typically, the payments to third-party developers are
conditioned upon the achievement by the developers of contractually specified
development milestones.  These payments
to third-party developers and intellectual property holders typically are
deemed to be advances and are recoupable against future royalties earned by the
developer or intellectual property holder based on the sale of the related
game. Additionally, in connection with
certain intellectual property right acquisitions and development agreements, we
will commit to spend specified amounts for marketing support for the related
game(s) which is to be developed or in which the intellectual property will be
utilized.  Assuming all


contractual provisions are met, the total
future minimum commitments for these and other contractual arrangements in
place as of March 31, 2004, are scheduled to be paid as follows (amounts in
thousands):

The developer and intellectual
property commitments above exclude approximately $9.3 million of commitments
originally scheduled to be paid between fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007
relating to an intellectual property rights agreement with a third party.  Effective June 30, 2003, we terminated the
agreement and filed a breach of contract suit against the third party.

Financial Disclosure

We
maintain internal controls over financial reporting, which generally include
those controls relating to the preparation of our financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. We also are focused on our “disclosure controls and procedures,”
which as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission are generally those
controls and procedures designed to ensure that financial and non-financial
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission is reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information
is communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and our
chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

Our Disclosure Committee, which operates
under the board approved Disclosure Committee Charter and Disclosure Controls
& Procedures Policy, includes senior management representatives and assists
executive management in its oversight of the accuracy and timeliness of our
disclosures, as well as in implementing and evaluating our overall disclosure
process. As part of our disclosure process, senior finance and operational
representatives from all of our corporate divisions and business units prepare
quarterly reports regarding their current quarter operational performance,
future trends, subsequent events, internal controls, changes in internal
controls and other accounting and disclosure-relevant information.  These quarterly reports are reviewed by
certain key corporate finance representatives. 
These corporate finance representatives also conduct quarterly
interviews on a rotating basis with the preparers of selected quarterly
reports. The results of the quarterly reports and related interviews are
reviewed by the Disclosure Committee. 
Finance representatives also conduct reviews with our senior management
team, our external counsel and other appropriate personnel involved in the
disclosure process, as appropriate. Additionally, senior finance and
operational representatives provide internal certifications regarding the
accuracy of information they provide that is utilized in the preparation of our
periodic public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Financial results and other financial
information also are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the board of
directors on a quarterly basis. As required by applicable regulatory
requirements, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
review and make various certifications regarding the accuracy of our periodic
public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, our
disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial
reporting. With the assistance of the Disclosure Committee, we will continue to
assess and monitor our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal
controls over financial reporting, and will make refinements as necessary.


Inflation

Our management currently believes that
inflation has not had a material impact on continuing operations.


Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the potential loss arising
from fluctuations in market rates and prices. 
Our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices.  Our market risk sensitive instruments are
classified as “other than trading.”  Our
views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may
occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may
occur, since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based
upon actual fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and
market prices and the timing of transactions.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure
to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our
investment portfolio.  We do not use
derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.  We manage our interest rate risk by
maintaining an investment portfolio consisting primarily of debt instruments
with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities.  We also manage our interest rate risk by
maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that we are
typically able to hold our investments to maturity.  As of March 31, 2004, our cash equivalents and short-term
investments included debt securities of $426.2 million.

The following
table presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates of our
investment portfolio as of March 31, 2004 (amounts in thousands):

Our short-term investments generally mature
between three months and two years.

Foreign Currency
Exchange Rate Risk

We transact business in many different
foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly GBP and EUR. The
volatility of GBP and EUR (and all other applicable currencies) will be
monitored frequently throughout the coming year.  When appropriate, we enter into hedging transactions in order to
mitigate our risk from foreign currency fluctuations. We will continue to use
hedging programs in the future and may use currency forward contracts, currency
options and/or other derivative financial instruments commonly utilized to
reduce financial market risks if it is determined that such hedging activities
are appropriate to reduce risk.  We do
not hold or purchase any foreign currency contracts for trading purposes.  As of March 31, 2004, we had no outstanding
hedging contracts.

Market Price Risk

With regard to the structured
stock repurchase transactions described in Note 16 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, at those times when we have structured stock
repurchase transactions outstanding, it is possible that at settlement we could
take delivery of shares at an effective repurchase price higher than the then
market price.  As of March 31, 2004, we
had no structured stock repurchase transactions outstanding.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Activision, Inc. (“Activision”
or “we”) is a leading international publisher of interactive entertainment
software products.  We have built a
company with a diverse portfolio of products that spans a wide range of
categories and target markets and that is used on a variety of game hardware
platforms and operating systems.  We
have created, licensed and acquired a group of highly recognizable brands,
which we market to a variety of consumer demographics.

Our products cover game
categories such as action/adventure, action sports, racing, role-playing,
simulation, first-person action and strategy. 
Our target customer base ranges from game enthusiasts and children to
mass-market consumers and “value” buyers. 
We currently offer our products primarily in versions that operate on
the Sony PlayStation 2 (“PS2”), Nintendo GameCube (“GameCube”) and Microsoft
Xbox (“Xbox”) console systems, Nintendo Game Boy Advance (“GBA”) hand-held
device and the personal computer (“PC”). 
In prior years, we have also offered our products on the Sony
PlayStation (“PS1”) and Nintendo 64 (“N64”) console systems and Nintendo Game
Boy Color (“GBC”) hand-held device.  In
addition, Sony announced that it would be entering the hand-held hardware
market with the introduction of its hand-held gaming device, PlayStation
Portable (“PSP”).  Nintendo also
announced that it plans to launch a new dual-screened, portable game system Nintendo
Dual Screen (“NDS”).  We are currently
developing titles for the PSP and NDS. 
We are also planning to develop titles for the next generation console
systems expected to be developed by Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo for release in
the next two to three years.

Our publishing business
involves the development, marketing and sale of products directly, by license
or through our affiliate label program with certain third-party
publishers.  Our distribution business
consists of operations in Europe that provide logistical and sales services to
third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own
publishing operations and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

We maintain operations in the
United States, Canada, the United Kingdom (“UK”), Germany, France, Italy,
Japan, Australia, Sweden and the Netherlands. 
In fiscal year 2004, international operations contributed approximately
53% of net revenues.

Principles of
Consolidation

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Activision, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash, Cash Equivalents
and Short-term Investments

Cash and cash equivalents include cash, money
markets and short-term investments with original maturities of not more than 90
days.

Short-term investments
generally mature between three months and two years.  Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as
short-term based on their liquid nature and because such securities represent
the investment of cash that is available for current operations.  All of our short-term investments are
classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair market value with
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) reported as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.  The specific identification method is used
to determine the cost of securities disposed with realized gains and losses
reflected in investment income, net.

Concentration of Credit
Risk

Financial instruments which
potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist principally of
temporary cash investments and accounts receivable.  We place our temporary cash investments with financial

F-6

institutions.  At various times during the fiscal years
ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, we had deposits in excess of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limit at these financial institutions.

Our customer base includes
retail outlets and distributors, including mass-market retailers, consumer
electronics stores, discount warehouses and game specialty stores in the United
States and countries worldwide.  We
perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for
potential credit losses.  We generally
do not require collateral or other security from our customers.  As of and for the years ended March 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, we had one customer that accounted for 20%, 16% and 14%,
respectively, of consolidated net revenues and 39%, 46% and 22%, respectively,
of consolidated accounts receivable, net. 
This customer was the same customer in all periods and was a customer of
both our publishing and distribution businesses.

Financial Instruments

The estimated fair values of
financial instruments have been determined using available market information
and valuation methodologies described below. 
However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data
to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented
herein may not be indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current
market exchange.  The use of different
market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the
estimated fair value amounts.

The carrying amounts of cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.  Short-term investments are carried at fair
value with fair values being estimated based on quoted market prices.

We account for derivative
instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”
SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities, an amendment of SFAS 133” and SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of
Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 133,
138 and 149 require that all derivatives, including foreign exchange contracts,
be recognized in the balance sheet in other current assets or accrued expenses
at their fair value.

We utilize forward contracts in
order to reduce financial market risks. 
These instruments are used to hedge foreign currency exposures of
underlying assets, liabilities, or certain forecasted foreign currency
denominated transactions.  Our
accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether they meet the
criteria for designation as hedging transactions.  Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash
flow hedges, are highly effective, and qualify as hedging instruments, are
recorded in other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged item is
recognized in earnings within the financial statement line item consistent with
the hedged item.  Any ineffective
portion of a derivative change in fair value is immediately recognized in
earnings.  Changes in fair value of
derivatives that do not qualify as hedging instruments are recorded in
earnings.  The fair value of foreign
currency contracts is estimated based on the spot rate of the various hedged
currencies as of the end of the period. 
As of March 31, 2004 and 2003, we had no outstanding foreign
exchange forward contracts.

Equity Investments

From time to time, we may make
a capital investment and hold a minority interest in a third-party developer in
connection with entertainment software products to be developed by such
developer for us.  We account for those
capital investments over which we have the ability to exercise significant
influence using the equity method.  For
those investments over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence, we account for our investment using the cost method.

Software Development Costs

Software development costs include payments made to independent
software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs
incurred for internally developed products.

We account for software development costs in
accordance with SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to
Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.” 
Software development costs are capitalized

F-7

once technological feasibility of a product
is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable.  Technological feasibility of a product
encompasses both technical design documentation and game design documentation.  For products where proven technology exists,
this may occur early in the development cycle. Technological feasibility is
evaluated on a product-by-product basis. 
Prior to a product’s release, we expense, as part of cost of sales –
software royalties and amortization, capitalized costs when we believe such
amounts are not recoverable. 
Capitalized costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned are
charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation.  Amounts related to software development
which are not capitalized are charged immediately to product development
expense.  We evaluate the future
recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.  The
recoverability of capitalized software development costs is evaluated based on
the expected performance of the specific products for which the costs relate.

Criteria
used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance
of comparable products using comparable technology; orders for the product
prior to its release; and estimated performance of a sequel product based on the
performance of the product on which the sequel is based.

Commencing upon product release, capitalized software development costs
are amortized to cost of sales – software royalties and amortization based on
the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues, generally resulting
in an amortization period of six months or less.  For products that have been released in prior periods, we
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly
basis.  The primary evaluation criterion
is actual title performance.

Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the
assessment of when technological feasibility is established, as well as in the
ongoing assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs.  In evaluating the recoverability of
capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes
forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional development costs to be
incurred.  If revised forecasted or
actual product sales are less than and/or revised forecasted or actual costs
are greater than the original forecasted amounts utilized in the initial
recoverability analysis, the actual impairment charge may be larger than
originally estimated in any given quarter.

Intellectual Property Licenses

Intellectual property license costs represent license fees paid to
intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks, copyrights,
software, technology or other intellectual property or proprietary rights in
the development of our products.  Depending
upon the agreement with the rights holder, we may obtain the rights to use
acquired intellectual property in multiple products over multiple years, or
alternatively, for a single product.

We evaluate the future recoverability of
capitalized intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis.  The recoverability of capitalized
intellectual property license costs is evaluated based on the expected
performance of the specific products in which the licensed trademark or
copyright is to be used.  As many of our
intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple
years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property
license costs based on certain qualitative factors such as the success of other
products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property,
whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series
based on the intellectual property and the rights holder’s continued promotion
and exploitation of the intellectual property. 
Prior to the related product’s release, we expense, as part of cost of
sales – intellectual property licenses, capitalized intellectual property costs
when we believe such amounts are not recoverable.  Capitalized intellectual property costs for those products that
are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in the
period of cancellation.  Criteria used
to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of
comparable products using comparable technology; orders for the product prior
to its release; and estimated performance of a sequel product based on the
performance of the product on which the sequel is based.

Commencing upon the related product’s release, capitalized intellectual
property license costs are amortized to cost of sales – intellectual property
licenses based on the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to
total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed property will
be utilized.  As intellectual property
license contracts may extend for multiple years, the amortization of
capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may
extend beyond one year.  For
intellectual property included in products that have been released, we evaluate
the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.  The primary evaluation criterion is actual
title performance.

F-8

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the
recoverability of capitalized costs.

In
evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected
product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of
additional development costs to be incurred. 
If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than and/or
revised forecasted or actual costs are greater than the original forecasted
amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the actual impairment
charge may be larger than originally estimated in any given quarter.  Additionally, as noted above, as many of our
intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple
years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property
license costs based on certain qualitative factors such as the success of other
products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property,
whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series
based on the intellectual property and the rights holder’s continued promotion
and exploitation of the intellectual property. 
Material differences may result in the amount and timing of charges for
any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different
estimates in evaluating these qualitative factors.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the
lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are
recorded at cost.  Depreciation and
amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the shorter of
the estimated useful lives or the lease term: 
buildings, 25 to 33 years; computer equipment, office furniture and
other equipment, 2 to 5 years; leasehold improvements, through the life of the
lease.  When assets are retired or
disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed and any
resultant gains or losses are recognized in current operations.

Goodwill

We account for goodwill using
the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles.”  SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting
and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and other intangible
assets.  Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is
deemed to have an indefinite useful life and should not be amortized but rather
tested at least annually for impairment. 
An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of
goodwill is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair
value.  In accordance with SFAS No. 142,
we have not amortized goodwill during the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of
title and risk of loss to our customers. 
Revenue from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated
allowance for returns and price protection. 
With respect to license agreements that provide customers the right to
make multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenue is recognized
upon delivery of such copies. Per copy royalties on sales that exceed the
guarantee are recognized as earned.  In
addition, in order to recognize revenue for both product sales and licensing
transactions, persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection
of the related receivable must be probable. 
Revenue recognition also determines the timing of certain expenses,
including cost of sales – intellectual property licenses and cost of sales –
software royalties and amortization.

Sales incentives or other
consideration given by us to our customers is accounted for in accordance with
the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer
(Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products).”  In accordance with EITF Issue 01-9, sales incentives and other
consideration that are considered adjustments of the selling price of our
products, such as rebates and product placement fees, are reflected as
reductions of revenue.  Sales incentives
and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or
services received, such as the appearance of our products in a customer’s
national circular ad, are reflected as sales and marketing expenses.

F-9

Allowance for Returns and Price Protection

In determining the appropriate
unit shipments to our customers, we benchmark our titles using historical and
industry data. We closely monitor and
analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of
products released by other publishers and the anticipated timing of other
releases in order to assess future demands of current and upcoming titles.  Initial volumes shipped upon title launch
and subsequent reorders are evaluated to ensure that quantities are sufficient
to meet the demands from the retail markets but at the same time, are
controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel.

We may permit product returns
from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain
conditions.  In general, price
protection refers to the circumstances when we elect to decrease the wholesale
price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and applicable, allows
customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to Activision with
respect to open and/or future invoices. 
The conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return
products or price protection are, among other things, compliance with
applicable payment terms, delivery to us of weekly inventory and sell-through
reports, and consistent participation in the launches of our premium title
releases.  We may also consider other
factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market
factors. Management must make estimates of potential future product returns and
price protection related to current period product revenue.  We estimate the amount of future returns and
price protection for current period product revenue utilizing historical
experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and
acceptance of our products by the end consumer.  The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future
returns and price protection for a particular title:  historical performance of titles in similar genres, historical
performance of the hardware platform, historical performance of the brand,
console hardware lifecycle, Activision sales force and retail customer
feedback, industry pricing, weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory, absolute
quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory, Activision warehouse on-hand
inventory levels, the title’s recent sell-through history (if available),
marketing trade programs and competing titles. 
The relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending
upon, among other items, genre, platform, seasonality and sales strategy.  Significant management judgments and
estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance
for returns and price protection in any accounting period.  Historically, total actual returns and price
protection have not exceeded our allowance estimates.  However, actual returns and price protection could vary
materially from our allowance estimates due to a number of reasons including,
among others, a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the same
period of a similarly themed title by a competitor, or technological
obsolescence due to the emergence of new hardware platforms.  Material differences may result in the
amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different
judgments or utilizes different estimates in determining the allowances for
returns and price protection.

Shipping and Handling

Shipping and handling costs,
which consist primarily of packaging and transportation charges incurred to
move finished goods to customers, are included in cost of sales – product
costs.

Advertising Expenses

We expense advertising as
incurred, except for production costs associated with media advertising which
are deferred and charged to expense the first time the related ad is run.  Advertising expenses for the years ended
March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were approximately $76.6 million, $60.0
million and $50.3 million, respectively, and are included in sales and
marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

F-10

Investment Income, Net

Investment income, net is
comprised of the following, (amounts in thousands):

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes
using SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”  Under SFAS No. 109, income taxes are accounted for under the
asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.  The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Foreign Currency
Translation

The functional currencies of
our foreign subsidiaries are their local currencies.  All assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the
period, and revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange
rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected as
a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’
equity.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income includes
net income, unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on short-term investments,
foreign currency translation adjustments, and the effective portion of gains or
losses on cash flow hedges that are presented as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.

Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities or the disclosure of
gain or loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per share is
computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for all periods.  Diluted earnings per share is computed by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding, increased by common stock equivalents.  Common stock equivalents are calculated
using the treasury stock method and represent incremental shares issuable upon
exercise of our outstanding options and warrants and, if applicable in the
period, conversion of our convertible debt. 
However, potential common shares are not included in the denominator of
the diluted earnings per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would
be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded.

F-11

Stock-Based Compensation
and Pro Forma Information

Under SFAS No. 123 “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,” compensation expense is recorded for the
issuance of stock options and other stock-based compensation based on the fair
value of the stock options and other stock-based compensation on the date of
grant or measurement date. 
Alternatively, SFAS No. 123 allows companies to continue to account for
the issuance of stock options and other stock-based compensation in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees.”  Under APB No. 25,
compensation expense is recorded for the issuance of stock options and other
stock-based compensation based on the intrinsic value of the stock options and
other stock-based compensation on the date of grant or measurement date.  Under the intrinsic value method,
compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant or measurement date only
if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the stock option or
other stock-based compensation exercise price. 
At March 31, 2004, we had several stock-based employee compensation
plans, which are described more fully in Note 15. We account for those plans
under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25 and
related Interpretations.  The following
table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied
the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee
compensation:

The fair value of options
granted in the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 has been
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted average assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option
pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including
the expected stock price volatility.  We
use the historical stock price volatility of our common stock over the most
recent period that is generally commensurate with the expected option life as
the basis for estimating expected stock price volatility.  In prior fiscal years, the historical stock
price volatility used was based on the daily, low stock price of our common
stock, which, in recent years, resulted in an expected volatility ranging from
approximately 65% to 70%.  For options
granted during each of the quarters in the year ended March 31, 2004,

F-12

the historical stock price
volatility used was based on a weekly stock price observation, using an average
of the high and low stock prices of our common stock, which resulted in an
expected stock price volatility ranging from 47% to 52%.  Management believes such amounts are more
representative of prospective trends. 
For purposes of the above pro forma disclosure, the fair value of
options granted is amortized to stock-based employee compensation cost over the
period(s) in which the related employee services are rendered.  Accordingly, the pro forma stock-based
compensation cost for any period will typically relate to options granted in
both the current period and prior periods.

For options granted during
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, the per share weighted average fair value of
options with exercise prices equal to market value on the date of grant was
$2.77, $4.37 and $3.05, respectively. 
The per share weighted average estimated fair value of Employee Stock
Purchase Plan shares granted during the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002 was $1.50, $2.17 and $1.96, respectively.

The effects on pro forma
disclosures of applying SFAS No. 123 are not likely to be representative of the
effects on pro forma disclosures of future years.

Common stock warrants are
granted to non-employees in connection with the development of software and
acquisition of licensing rights for intellectual property.  In accordance with EITF No. 96-18,
“Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for
Acquiring or in Connection With Selling Goods or Services,” the fair value of
common stock warrants granted is determined as of the measurement date and is
capitalized, expensed and amortized consistent with our policies relating to
software development and intellectual property license costs.

Related Parties

In August 2001, we elected to our Board of
Directors an individual who is a partner in a law firm that has provided legal
services to Activision for more than ten years.  For the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the fees
we paid to the law firm account for less than 1% of the firm’s total
revenues.  We believe that the fees
charged to us by the law firm are competitive with the fees charged by other
law firms.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the
consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the
current year’s presentation.  These
reclassifications had no effect on net income, shareholders’ equity or net increase
in cash and cash equivalents.

Stock Splits

In April 2003, the Board
of Directors approved a three-for-two split of our outstanding common shares
effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. 
The split was paid on June 6, 2003 to shareholders of record as of
May 16, 2003.  In February 2004,
the Board of Directors approved a second three-for-two split of our outstanding
common shares effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend.  The split was paid on March 15, 2004 to
shareholders of record as of February 23, 2004.  The par value of our common stock was maintained at the pre-split
amount of $.000001.  The consolidated
financial statements and Notes thereto, including all share and per share data,
have been restated as if the stock splits had occurred as of the earliest
period presented.

3.

Acquisitions

During the three years ended
March 31, 2004, we separately completed the acquisition of six privately
held interactive software development companies.  We accounted for these acquisitions in accordance with SFAS No.
141, “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for business combinations, requiring that the purchase method be used
to account and report for all business combinations.  These acquisitions have further enabled us to implement our multi-platform
development strategy by bolstering our internal product development
capabilities for console systems and personal computers and strengthening our
position in the first-person action, action and action sports game categories.  A significant portion of the purchase price
for all of these acquisitions was assigned to goodwill as the primary asset we
acquired in each of the transactions was an assembled workforce with proven
technical and design talent with a history of high

F-13

quality product creation.  Pro forma consolidated statements of
operations for these acquisitions are not shown, as they would not differ
materially from reported results.

Software
Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses

As of March 31, 2004,
capitalized software development costs included $35.3 million of internally
developed software costs and $51.5 million of payments made to third-party
software developers.  As of March 31,
2003, capitalized software development costs included $26.0 million of
internally developed software costs and $36.1 million of payments made to
third-party software developers. 
Capitalized intellectual property licenses were $48.5 million and $45.8
million as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Amortization and write-offs of capitalized
software development costs and intellectual property licenses, combined, was
$87.9 million, $100.4 million and $62.5 million for the years ended
March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

During the three months ended
December 31, 2003, we executed a realignment of our product portfolio
driven by the evolution of the video game market, which is increasingly
dominated by high quality products that are based on recognizable franchises
and supported with big marketing programs. 
We completed a comprehensive review of our product portfolio in which we
evaluated each product based on a number of criteria, including:  the strength of the franchise, the projected
product quality, the potential responsiveness of the product to aggressive
marketing support and the financial risk in the event of product failure.  As a result of this review, we believe that
we have an extensive slate of high-potential properties in development.  However, we also found that certain projects
had a lower likelihood of achieving acceptable levels of operating performance
and that continued pursuit of these projects would create a substantial
opportunity cost as it related to our slate of high-potential projects.
Accordingly, in the three months ended December 31, 2003, we canceled the
development of ten products which we believed were unlikely to produce an
acceptable level of return on our investment. 
In connection with the cancellation of these products, we recorded a
pre-tax charge of approximately $21 million which is included in the
consolidated statement of operations in product development expense.

For the year ended
March 31, 2003, amortization and write-offs of capitalized software
development costs and intellectual property licenses included approximately
$15.0 million recorded in the fourth quarter as the result of the assessment of
the recoverability of capitalized development costs relating to certain
projects and certain of our investments in long-term licensing agreements.

Operations
by Reportable Segments and Geographic Area

Based upon our organizational
structure, we operate two business segments: (i) publishing of interactive
entertainment software and (ii) distribution of interactive entertainment
software and hardware products.

Publishing refers to the
development, marketing and sale of products directly, by license or through our
affiliate label program with certain third-party publishers.  In the United States, we primarily sell our
products on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics
stores, discount warehouses and game specialty stores.  We conduct our international publishing
activities through offices in the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Australia,
Sweden, Canada and Japan.  Our products
are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis and through third-party
distribution and licensing arrangements and through our wholly-owned
distribution subsidiaries located in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany.

Distribution refers to our
operations in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany that provide logistical and
sales services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software,
our own publishing operations and manufacturers of interactive entertainment
hardware.

Resources are allocated to each
of these segments using information on their respective net revenues and
operating profits before interest and taxes.

The accounting policies of
these segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies.  Transactions
between segments are eliminated in consolidation.

Geographic information is based

Revenues by platform were as follows (amounts

A significant portion of our revenues is derived from products based on
a relatively small number of popular brands each year.  In fiscal 2004, 31% of our consolidated net
revenues (44% of worldwide publishing net revenues) was derived from two
brands, one of which accounted for 17% and the other of which accounted for 14%
of consolidated net revenues (24% and 20%, respectively, of worldwide
publishing net revenues).  In fiscal
2003, 38% of our consolidated net revenues (52% of worldwide publishing net
revenues) was derived from two brands, one of which accounted for 20% and the
other of which accounted for 18% of consolidated net revenues (27% and 25%,
respectively, of worldwide publishing net revenues).  In fiscal 2002, 35% of our consolidated net revenues (50% of
worldwide publishing net revenues) was derived from two brands, one of which
accounted for 31% and the other of which accounted for 4% of consolidated net
revenues (44% and 6%, respectively, of worldwide publishing net revenues).

with certain net operating loss carryovers relate to employee stock
options.  Pursuant to SFAS No. 109, net
operating losses have been reduced by $12.7 million relating to these items
which will be credited to additional paid-in capital when realized.

As of March 31, 2004, our
available federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $62.0
million is subject to certain limitations as defined under Section 382 of
the Internal Revenue Code.  The net
operating

F-25

loss carryforwards expire
between 2020 and 2023.  We have various
state net operating loss carryforwards which are not subject to limitations
under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.  We have tax credit carryforwards of $22.8 million and $13.8
million for federal and state purposes, respectively, which begin to expire in
2006.

At March 31, 2004, our
deferred income tax asset for tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss
carryforwards was reduced by a valuation allowance of $18.9 million as compared
to $27.6 million in the prior fiscal year. 
Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the continued
generation of sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of tax credits and
loss carryforwards.  Although
realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that
the net carrying value of the deferred tax asset will be realized.

Cumulative undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided
approximated $52.7 million at March 31, 2004.  Deferred income taxes on these earnings have not been provided as
these amounts are considered to be permanent in duration.

Long-Term
Debt

Mortgage Notes Payable

As of March 31, 2003,
long-term debt and the current portion of long-term debt of $2.8 million were
comprised of the mortgage note payable related to the land, office and
warehouse facilities of our German subsidiary. 
The German mortgage note bore interest at 5.45%, was due in bi-annual
installments of Euro (“EUR”) 73,900 ($89,958), was collateralized by the
related assets and was scheduled to mature in December 2018.  The German mortgage note was repaid in full
in fiscal 2004.

Credit Facilities

We have revolving credit
facilities with our Centresoft subsidiary located in the UK (the “UK Facility”)
and our NBG subsidiary located in Germany (the “German Facility”).  The UK Facility provided Centresoft with the
ability to borrow up to Great British Pounds (“GBP”) 8.0 million ($14.6
million) and GBP 8.6 million ($13.5 million), including issuing letters of
credit, on a revolving basis as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Furthermore, under the UK Facility, Centresoft provided a GBP 0.3 million ($0.5
million) and a EUR 1.0 million ($1.1 million) guarantee for the benefit of our
CD Contact subsidiary as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The UK Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus
2.0% and LIBOR plus 1.5% as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, is
collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and expires
in November 2004.  The UK Facility
also contains various covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain
specified financial ratios related to, among others, fixed charges.  As of March 31, 2004 and 2003, we were
in compliance with these covenants.  No
borrowings were outstanding against the UK Facility as of March 31, 2004
or 2003.  The German Facility provided
for revolving loans up to EUR 0.5 million ($0.6 million) and EUR 0.8 million
($0.8 million) as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, bore interest
at a Eurocurrency rate plus 2.5%, is collateralized by certain of the
subsidiary’s property and equipment and has no expiration date.  No borrowings were outstanding against the
German Facility as of March 31, 2004 or 2003.

Private Placement of Convertible Subordinated
Notes

In December 1997, we
completed the private placement of $60.0 million principal amount of 6¾%
convertible subordinated notes due 2005 (the “Notes”).  The Notes were convertible, in whole or in
part, at the option of the holder at any time after December 22, 1997 (the
date of original issuance) and prior to the close of business on the business day
immediately preceding the maturity date, unless previously redeemed or
repurchased, into our common stock at a conversion price of $5.593 per share,
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.  During the three months ended June 30, 2001, we called for
the redemption of the Notes.  In
connection with that call, holders converted to common stock approximately
$58.7 million aggregate principal amount of their Notes, net of conversion
costs.  The remaining Notes were
redeemed for cash.

Commitments
and Contingencies

Developer and
Intellectual Property Contracts

In the normal course of
business we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for the
development of products, as well as for the rights to intellectual
property.  Under these agreements, we
commit to provide specified payments to a developer, or intellectual property
holder, based upon contractual arrangements. 
Typically, the payments to
third-party developers are conditioned upon the achievement by the developers
of contractually specified development milestones.  These payments to third-party developers and intellectual
property holders typically are deemed to be advances and are recoupable against
future royalties earned by the developer or intellectual property holder based
on the sale of the related game.

Assuming all contractual provisions are
met, the total future minimum contract commitment for contracts in place as of
March 31, 2004 is approximately $89.3 million, which is scheduled to be
paid as follows (amounts in thousands):

The commitment schedule above excludes approximately
$9.3 million of commitments originally scheduled to be paid between fiscal 2004
through fiscal 2007 relating to an intellectual property rights agreement with
a third party.  Effective June 30,
2003, we terminated the agreement and filed a breach of contract suit against
the third party.

Marketing Commitments

In connection with certain intellectual property
right acquisitions and development agreements, we will commit to spend
specified amounts for marketing support for the related game(s) which is to be
developed or in which the intellectual property will be utilized.  Assuming all contractual provisions are met,
the total future minimum marketing commitment for contracts in place as of
March 31, 2004 is approximately $66.4 million, which is scheduled to be paid
as follows (amounts in thousands):

Lease Obligations

We lease certain of our
facilities under non-cancelable operating lease agreements.  Total future minimum lease commitments as of

Legal Proceedings

On March 5, 2004, a class
action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our current and former
officers and directors.  The complaint,
which asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 based on allegations that our revenues and assets were overstated
during the period between February 1, 2001 and December 17, 2002, was
filed in the United States District Court, Central District of California by
the Construction Industry and Carpenters Joint Pension Trust for Southern
Nevada purporting to represent a class of purchasers of Activision stock.  Five additional purported class actions have
subsequently been filed by Gianni Angeloni, Christopher Hinton, Stephen Anish,
the Alaska Electrical Pension Fund, and Joseph A. Romans asserting the same
claims.  Five of the six actions have
been transferred to the same court where the first-filed complaint was
pending.  In addition, on March 12,
2004, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed, purportedly on behalf of Activision,
which in large measure asserts the identical claims set forth in the federal
class action lawsuit.  That complaint
was filed in Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles.  We strongly deny these allegations and will
vigorously defend these cases.

On July 11, 2003, we were
informed by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that the
Securities and Exchange Commission has commenced a non-public formal
investigation captioned “In the Matter of Certain Video Game Manufacturers and
Distributors.” The investigation appears to be focused on certain accounting
practices common to the interactive entertainment industry, with specific
emphasis on revenue recognition.  In
connection with this inquiry, the Securities and Exchange Commission submitted
to us a request for information.  We responded
to this inquiry on September 2, 2003. 
To date, we have not received a request from the Securities and Exchange
Commission for any additional information. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission staff also informed us that other
companies in the video game industry received similar requests for information.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has advised us that this request for
information should not be construed as an indication from the Securities and
Exchange Commission or its staff that any violation of the law has occurred,
nor should it reflect negatively on any person, entity or security. We have
cooperated and intend to continue to cooperate fully with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in the conduct of this inquiry.

On June 30, 2003, we
terminated our Star Trek Merchandising License Agreement with Viacom Consumer
Products, Inc. and filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of
California for breach of contract and constructive trust against Viacom
Consumer Products and Viacom International, Inc. (“Viacom”). On August 15,
2003, Viacom filed its response to our complaint as well as a cross-complaint
alleging, among other matters, a breach of contract by Activision and seeking
claimed damages in excess of $50 million. We strongly dispute the claims by
Viacom, consider the damages alleged by Viacom to be speculative and without
merit, and intend to defend vigorously and aggressively against the
cross-complaint.

In addition, w

e are party to other routine
claims and suits brought by us and against us in the ordinary course of
business, including disputes arising over the ownership of intellectual
property rights, contractual claims and collection matters.  In the opinion of management, after
consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such routine claims will not
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

Stock
Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans

Stock Option Plans

We sponsor several stock option
plans for the benefit of officers, employees, consultants and others.

On September 23, 1998, the
shareholders of Activision approved the Activision 1998 Incentive Plan, as
amended (the “1998 Plan”).  The 1998
Plan permits the granting of “Awards” in the form of non-qualified stock
options, ISOs, SARs, restricted stock awards, deferred stock awards and other
common stock-based awards to directors, officers, employees, consultants and
others.  The total number of shares of
common stock available for distribution under the 1998 Plan is 10,125,000.  The 1998 Plan requires available shares to
consist in whole or in part of authorized and unissued shares or treasury
shares.  There were approximately 11,800
shares remaining available for grant under the 1998 Plan as of March 31,
2004.

On April 26, 1999, the
Board of Directors approved the Activision 1999 Incentive Plan, as amended (the
“1999 Plan”).  The 1999 Plan permits the

Plan, 2002 Studio Plan and 2003 Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) is determined
at the discretion of the Board of Directors (or the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors, which administers the Plans), and for ISOs, is not to be
less than the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant, or in
the case of non-qualified options, must exceed or be equal to 85% of the fair
market value of our common stock at the date of grant.  Options typically become exercisable in installments
over a period not to exceed seven years and must be exercised within 10 years
of the date of grant.  However, certain
options granted to executives vest immediately.  Historically, stock options have been granted with exercise
prices equal to or greater than the fair market value at the date of grant.

Other Employee Stock Options

In connection with prior
employment agreements between Activision and Robert A. Kotick, Activision’s
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian G. Kelly, Activision’s
Co-Chairman, Mr. Kotick and Mr. Kelly were granted options to purchase common
stock.  The Board of Directors approved
the granting of these options.  Relating
to such grants, as of March 31, 2004, approximately 7,816,400 shares were
outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $2.81.

We additionally have
approximately 209,500 options outstanding to employees as of March 31,

of these options.  Such options have
terms similar to those options granted under the Plans.

Director Warrants

During the fiscal year ended
March 31, 1997, we issued warrants to purchase 135,000 shares of our
common stock, at exercise prices ranging from $3.50 to $4.11 to two of our
outside directors in connection with their election to the Board.  Such warrants vested 25% on the first
anniversary of the date of grant, and 12.5% each six months thereafter and
expire within 10 years from the date of grant. 
Relating to such warrants, as of March 31, 2004, approximately

Employee Stock Purchase
Plans

On July 22, 2002, the
Board of Directors approved the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for eligible
domestic employees.  The shareholders of
Activision subsequently approved the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan on
September 19, 2002.  Then, on
February 11, 2003, the Board of Directors approved the 2002 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan For International Employees. The primary terms of the 2002
Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan For
International Employees (collectively the “2002 Purchase Plans”) are the
same.  Under the 2002 Purchase Plans, up
to 1,125,000 shares of our common stock may be purchased by eligible employees
during two overlapping, twelve-month offering periods that commence each
April 1 and October 1 (the “Offering Period”).  At any point in time, employees may
participate in only one Offering Period. 
The first day of each Offering Period is referred to as the “Offering
Date.”  Common stock is purchased by
2002 Purchase Plans participants at 85% of the lesser of fair market value on
the Offering Date for the Offering Period that includes the common stock purchase
date or the fair market value on the common stock purchase date.  Employees may purchase shares having a value
not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an Offering Period,
limited to a maximum of 11,250 common shares per common stock purchase
date.  During the year ended
March 31, 2004, employees purchased approximately 242,300, 60,000 and
255,300 shares at a price of $5.48, $7.06 and $5.48 per share, respectively,
within the 2002 Purchase Plans’ Offering Periods.

Prior to the 2002 Purchase
Plans, we had an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible domestic
employees (the “Prior Purchase Plan”). 
Under the Prior Purchase Plan, shares of our common stock could be
purchased at six-month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value
on the first or last day of each six-month

F-30

period.  Employees could purchase shares having a
value not exceeding 10% of their gross compensation during each six-month
period.  Employees purchased
approximately 114,750 and 209,250 shares at a price of $9.47 and $5.57 per
share during the six months ended September 30, 2002 and March 31,
2003, respectively.  The Prior Purchase
Plan expired on March 31, 2003.

Activity of Employee and Director Options and Warrants

Activity of all employee and director options and warrants during the
last three fiscal years was as follows (amounts in thousands, except weighted
average exercise price amounts):

For the years ended
March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, all options were granted at an exercise
price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant.

The following tables summarize
information about all employee and director stock options and warrants
outstanding as of March 31, 2004 (share amounts in thousands):

Non-Employee Warrants

In prior years, we have granted
stock warrants to third parties in connection with the development of software
and the acquisition of licensing rights for intellectual property.  The warrants generally vest upon grant and
are exercisable over the term of the warrant. 
The exercise price of third-party warrants is generally greater than or
equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant.  No third-party warrants were granted during
the year ended March 31, 2004.  As
of March 31, 2004, 1,539,000 third-party warrants to purchase common stock
were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $9.50 per
share.  During the year ended
March 31, 2003, we granted warrants to a third party to purchase 337,500
shares of our common stock at

F-31

an exercise price of $13.22 per
share in connection with, and as partial consideration for, a license agreement
that allows us to utilize intellectual property owned by the third party in
conjunction with an Activision product. The warrants vested upon grant and have
a three-year term. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the
Black-Scholes pricing model, assuming a risk-free rate of 4.18%, a volatility
factor of 70% and expected term as noted above. The per share weighted average
estimated fair value of the third-party warrants granted during the year ended
March 31, 2003 was $6.47 per share. 
As of March 31, 2003, 1,984,500 third-party warrants to purchase
common stock were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $6.25
per share.  No third-party warrants were
granted during the year ended March 31, 2002.  As of March 31, 2002, 1,747,500 third-party warrants to
purchase common stock were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price
of $7.81 per share.

In accordance with EITF 96-18,
we measure the fair value of the securities on the measurement date.  The fair value of each warrant is
capitalized and amortized to expense when the related product is released and
the related revenue is recognized.  Additionally,
as more fully described in Note 1, the recoverability of capitalized software
development costs and intellectual property licenses is evaluated on a
quarterly basis with amounts determined as not recoverable being charged to
expense.  In connection with the
evaluation of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property
licenses, any capitalized amounts for related third-party warrants are
additionally reviewed for recoverability with amounts determined as not
recoverable being amortized to expense. 
For the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, $0.2 million,
$3.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, was amortized and included in cost
of sales - software royalties and amortization and/or cost of sales -
intellectual property licenses.

Employee Retirement Plan

We have a retirement plan
covering substantially all of our eligible employees.  The retirement plan is qualified in accordance with
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Under the plan, employees may defer up to 15% of their pre-tax
salary, but not more than statutory limits. 
Effective January 1, 2003, we contribute 20% of each dollar
contributed by a participant.  Prior to
January 1, 2003, we contributed 5% of each dollar contributed by a
participant.  Our matching contributions
to the plan were approximately $700,000, $320,000, and $82,000 during the years
ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Capital
Transactions

Buyback Program

During
fiscal 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a buyback program under which we
can repurchase up to $350.0 million of our common stock. Under the program,
shares may be purchased as determined by management, from time to time and
within certain guidelines, in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions, including privately negotiated structured stock repurchase
transactions and through transactions in the options markets. Depending on
market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or
suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice.

F-32

Under the buyback program, we repurchased
approximately 1.9 million shares of our common stock for $12.4 million and 16.2
million shares our common stock for $101.4 million, during the years ended
March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 
In addition, approximately 1.7 million shares of common stock were
acquired in the year ended March 31, 2004 as a result of the settlement of
$10.0 million of structured stock repurchase transactions entered into in
fiscal 2003.  Structured stock
repurchase transactions are settled in cash or stock based on the market price
of our common stock on the date of the settlement. Upon settlement, we either
have our capital investment returned with a premium or receive shares of our
common stock, depending, respectively, on whether the market price of our
common stock is above or below a pre-determined price agreed in connection with
each such transaction.  These
transactions are recorded in shareholders’ equity in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.  As of March 31,
2004, we had approximately $226.2 million available for utilization under the
buyback program and no outstanding structured stock repurchase
transactions.  In any period, cash
provided by or used in financing activities related to common stock repurchase
transactions may differ from the comparable change in shareholders’ equity,
reflecting timing differences between the recognition of share repurchase
transactions and their settlement for cash.

Shelf Registrations

In August 2003, we filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission two amended shelf registration
statements, including the base prospectuses therein. The first shelf
registration statement, on Form S-3, allows us, at any time, to offer any
combination of securities described in the base prospectus in one or more
offerings with an aggregate initial offering price of up to $500,000,000.  Unless we state otherwise in the applicable
prospectus supplement, we expect to use the net proceeds from the sale of the
securities for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures,
working capital, repayment or reduction of long-term and short-term debt and
the financing of acquisitions and other business combinations. We may invest
funds that we do not immediately require in marketable securities.

The second shelf registration
statement, on Form S-4, allows us, at any time, to offer any combination of
securities described in the base prospectus in one or more offerings with an
aggregate initial offering price of up to $250,000,000 in connection with our
acquisition of the assets, business or securities of other companies whether by
purchase, merger, or any other form of business combination.

Shareholders’ Rights Plan

On April 18, 2000, our
Board of Directors approved a shareholders rights plan (the “Rights
Plan”).  Under the Rights Plan, each
common shareholder at the close of business on April 19, 2000, received a
dividend of one right for each share of common stock held.  Each right represents the right to purchase
one one-hundredths (1/100) of a share of our Series A Junior Preferred Stock at
an exercise price of $40.00.  Initially,
the rights are represented by our common stock certificates and are neither
exercisable nor traded separately from our common stock.  The rights will only become exercisable if a
person or group acquires 15% or more of the common stock of Activision, or
announces or commences a tender or exchange offer which would result in the
bidder’s beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock.

In the event that any person or
group acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock each holder of a
right (other than such person or members of such group) will thereafter have
the right to receive upon exercise of such right, in lieu of shares of Series A
Junior Preferred Stock, the number of shares of common stock of Activision
having a value equal to two times the then current exercise price of the
right.  If we are acquired in a merger
or other business combination transaction after a person has acquired 15% or
more of our common stock, each holder of a right will thereafter have the right
to receive upon exercise of such right a number of the acquiring company’s
common shares having a market value equal to two times the then current
exercise price of the right.  For persons
who, as of the close of business on April 18, 2000, beneficially own 15%
or more of the common stock of Activision, the Rights Plan “grandfathers” their
current level of ownership, so long as they do not purchase additional shares
in excess of certain limitations.

We may redeem the rights for
$.01 per right at any time until the first public announcement of the
acquisition of beneficial ownership of 15% of our common stock.  At any time after a person has acquired 15%
or more (but before any person has acquired more than 50%) of our common stock,
we may exchange all or part of the rights for shares of common stock at an
exchange ratio of one share of common stock per right.  The rights expire on April 18, 2010.
