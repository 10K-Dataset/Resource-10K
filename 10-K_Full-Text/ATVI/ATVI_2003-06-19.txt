Item 1.

BUSINESS

(a)

General

Activision,
Inc. (“Activision” or “we”) is a leading international publisher of interactive
entertainment software products.  We
have built a company with a diverse portfolio of products that spans a wide
range of categories and target markets and that is used on a variety of game
hardware platforms and operating systems. 
We have created, licensed and acquired a group of highly recognizable
brands which we market to a growing variety of consumer demographics.  Our fiscal 2003 product portfolio included
such products as

Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4

,

Spider-Man: The Movie

,

Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven

and

Street Hoops

.

Our products
cover game categories such as action/adventure, action sports, racing,
role-playing, simulation, first-person action and strategy.  We currently offer our products in versions
that operate on systems such as the Sony PlayStation 2 (“PS2”), Sony
PlayStation (“PS1”), Nintendo GameCube (“GameCube”), Microsoft Xbox (“Xbox”),
Nintendo Game Boy Advance (“GBA”) and the personal computer (“PC”).  Our target audiences range from game
enthusiasts and children to mass-market consumers and “value” buyers.

Our publishing
business involves the development, marketing and sale of products, either
directly, by license or through our affiliate label program with third-party
publishers.  Our distribution business
consists of operations in Europe that provide logistical and sales services to
third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own
publishing operations and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

We were
originally incorporated in California in 1979. 
In December 1992, we reincorporated in Delaware.  In June 2000, we reorganized into a holding
company organizational structure.

In April 2003,
the Board of Directors approved a three-for-two split of our outstanding common
shares effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend.  The split is payable on June 6, 2003 to shareholders of record as
of May 16, 2003.  Consolidated financial
information and other applicable information presented in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, including all share and per share data, has been restated as if the
stock split had occurred as of the earliest period presented.

(b)

Business
Combinations

We have
completed a number of acquisitions of both software development companies and
interactive entertainment product distribution companies.  The interactive entertainment industry is
consolidating and we intend to continue to expand our resources through
acquisitions, strategic relationships and key license transactions.  During fiscal 2003, we continued to enhance
our internal product development capabilities with the acquisitions of two
privately held interactive software development companies, Z-Axis Ltd.
(“Z-Axis”) and Luxoflux Corporation (“Luxoflux”), as well as a 30% capital
investment in a third, Infinity Ward. 
See the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in
Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding
these and prior acquisitions.

(c)

Financial
Information About Industry Segments

We have two
reportable segments: publishing and distribution.  Publishing relates to the development (both internally and externally),
marketing and sale of DVD, CD and cartridge based interactive entertainment
software products owned or controlled by us, either directly, by license or
through our affiliate label program with third-party publishers.  Distribution primarily refers to logistical
and sales services provided by our European distribution subsidiaries to
third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own
publishing operations and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.  See the Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
certain financial information required by Item 1.

Narrative
Description of Business

Our objective
is to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing and distribution of
quality interactive entertainment software products that deliver a highly
satisfying consumer entertainment experience. 
Our business strategy, the key components of our business operations and
the risk factors that could impact our business are detailed below.

Strategy

Create and Maintain Diversity in Product Mix,
Platforms and Markets.

We believe that maintaining a diversified mix of products can
reduce our operating risks and enhance profitability. Therefore, we develop and
publish products spanning a wide range of product categories, including
action/adventure, action sports, racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person
action and strategy.  We also develop
products designed for target audiences ranging from game enthusiasts and
children to mass-market consumers and “value” buyers.  Presently, we concentrate on developing, publishing and
distributing products that operate on PS2, GameCube and Xbox console systems,
GBA hand-held device and the PC. We typically offer our products for use on
multiple platforms in order to reduce the risks associated with any single
platform, leverage our costs over a larger installed hardware base and increase
unit sales.

Create, Acquire and Maintain Strong Brands.

We focus development and publishing
activities principally on products that are, or have the potential to become,
franchise properties with sustainable consumer appeal and brand recognition.
These products can then serve as the basis for sequels, prequels and related
new products that can be released over an extended period of time. We believe
that the publishing and distribution of products based in large part on
franchise properties enhances predictability of revenues and the probability of
high unit volume sales and operating profits. We have entered into a series of
strategic relationships with the owners of intellectual property pursuant to
which we have acquired the rights to publish products based on franchises such
as Marvel Comics’ properties including Spider-Man, X-MEN, Iron Man and
Fantastic Four and various Disney properties. We have additionally entered into
exclusive licensing agreements to develop and publish video games based on the
best-selling children’s book series, Lemony Snicket’s “A Series of Unfortunate
Events” which is being developed into a feature film, as well as for DreamWorks
SKG’s Shrek 2 and three other upcoming computer-animated films, Sharkslayer,
Madagascar and Over the Hedge and their sequels.  We have capitalized on the success of our Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater
products to sign long-term agreements, many of which are exclusive, with Tony
Hawk and numerous other action sports athletes.  We also have created a limited number of new intellectual
properties, such as True Crime: Streets of L.A. and Call of Duty, that we
believe have the potential to join this list of franchise properties.

Execute Disciplined Product Selection and
Development Processes.

The success of our publishing business depends, in significant
part, on our ability to develop high quality games that will generate high unit
volume sales.   Our publishing units
have implemented a formal control process for the selection, development,
production and quality assurance of our products. We apply this process, which
we refer to as the “Greenlight Process,” to all of our products, whether
externally or internally developed. The Greenlight Process includes in-depth
reviews of each project at five important stages of development by a team that
includes many of our highest-ranking operating managers and coordination
between our sales and marketing personnel and development staff at each step in
the process.

We develop our
products using a combination of our internal development resources and external
development resources acting under contract with us, some of which are
independent and in some of which we are a capital investor. We typically select
our external developers based on their track record and expertise in producing
products in the same category. One developer will often produce the same game
for multiple platforms and will produce sequels to the original game. We
believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us
to strengthen and leverage the particular expertise of our internal and
external development resources that we anticipate will add to the quality of
our products.

Continue to Improve Profitability.

We continually strive to successfully manage
risk and increase our operating leverage and efficiency with the goal of
increased profitability. We believe the key factor affecting our profitability
will be the success rate of our product releases. Therefore, our product
selection and development process includes, as a significant component,
periodic evaluations of the expected commercial success of products under
development. Through this process, titles that we determine to be less
promising are discontinued before we incur


additional development costs
or, if necessary, corrections are made in the development process. In addition,
our focus on cross platform releases and branded products will, we believe,
contribute to this strategic goal.

We continue to
focus on increasing our margins. We have acquired certain experienced and
specialized developers in instances where we can enhance profitability through
the elimination of royalty obligations. 
Additionally, we often rely on independent third-party interactive
entertainment software developers to develop some of our software products,
thereby taking advantage of specialized third-party developers without
incurring the fixed overhead obligations associated with increased internally
employed staff.

Our sales and
marketing operations work with our studio resources to increase the visibility
of new product launches and to coordinate the timing and promotion of product
releases. Our finance and administration and sales and marketing personnel work
together to improve inventory management and receivables collections. We have
broadly instituted objective-based reward programs that provide incentives to
management and staff throughout the organization to produce results that meet
our financial objectives.

Grow Through Continued Strategic Acquisitions
and Alliances.

The interactive entertainment industry is consolidating, and we believe
that success in this industry will be driven in part by the ability to take
advantage of scale. Specifically, smaller companies are more capital
constrained, enjoy less predictability of revenues and cash flow, lack product
diversity and must spread fixed costs over a smaller revenue base. Several
industry leaders are emerging that combine the entrepreneurial and creative
spirit of the industry with professional management, the ability to access the
capital markets and the ability to maintain favorable relationships with
developers, intellectual property owners and retailers. Through 14 completed
acquisitions since 1997, we believe that we have successfully diversified our
operations, our channels of distribution, our development talent pool and our
library of titles, and have emerged as one of the industry’s leaders. We intend
to continue to evaluate the expansion of our resources through acquisitions,
strategic relationships and key license transactions. We intend to focus on
expanding our intellectual property library through key license transactions
and strategic relationships with intellectual property owners and to continue
to evaluate opportunities to increase our development capacity through the
acquisition of or investment in selected experienced development firms.

Products

Historically
we have been best known for our action/adventure, strategy and simulation
products.  With the successful
introduction of action sports products, such as the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater
brand, we are the leader in the action sports category.  We have also found success in the
superheroes category with our release of titles based on the Spider-Man, X-MEN
and Blade properties.  In addition, we
have established ourselves as a leader in the “value” software publishing
business with products under our Cabela’s license, as well as with products
distributed on behalf of our “value” affiliate label partners.   Products published by us in this category
are generally developed by third parties, often under contract with us, and are
marketed under the Activision Value Publishing name.  Value software is typically less sophisticated and less complex,
both in terms of the development process and consumer gameplay.  First-person action, racing and role-playing
are also important categories for us, and in the future we may expand our
product offerings into new categories.

Hardware Licenses.

Our products currently are being developed or published primarily for Sony
PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube and Microsoft Xbox console systems, Nintendo
Game Boy Advance hand-held device and personal computers.  In order to maintain general access to the
console systems and hand-held device marketplace, we have maintained licenses
for PS2, GameCube and Xbox console systems and the GBA hand-held device with
the owners of each platform.  Each
license allows us to create multiple products for the applicable system,
subject to certain approval rights which are reserved by each licensor.  Each license also requires that we pay the
licensor a per unit license fee for each unit manufactured.  In contrast, we currently are not required
to obtain any license for the development and production of products for personal
computers.

Intellectual Property Rights.

Many of our current and planned releases are
based on intellectual property and other character or story rights licensed
from third parties, as well as a combination of characters, worlds and concepts
derived from our extensive library of titles, original characters, and concepts
owned and created by us.  When
publishing products based on licensed intellectual property rights, we
generally seek to capitalize on the name recognition, marketing efforts and goodwill
associated with the underlying property. For Activision-owned intellectual
property, we generally attempt to establish such properties as sustainable,
long-term game franchises.


In acquiring
intellectual property rights from third parties, we seek to obtain rights to
publish titles across a variety of platforms, to include the ability to produce
multiple titles and to retain rights over an extended period of time.  In past years, we have been able to enter
into a series of long-term or multi-product agreements with owners of various
intellectual properties that are well known throughout the world and to create
products based on these recognizable characters, story lines or concepts.  These agreements typically provide us with
exclusive publishing rights for a specific period of time and, in some cases,
for specified platforms. The scope of our licensing activities includes
theatrical motion pictures, television shows, animated films and series, comic
books, literary works, sports personalities and events and celebrities. We
intend to continue expanding relationships with our existing intellectual
property partners and to enter into agreements with other intellectual property
owners for other recognizable properties, characters, story lines and
concepts.  We may not, however, be able
to maintain or expand our existing relationships or to seek out and sustain new
long-term relationships of similar caliber in the future.

Product
Development and Support

We use a mix
of internal and external resources to develop our products.  In addition to product developers we own
entirely or control, we consider product developers in which we have a
significant minority equity investment and those with whom we have long-term
agreements to develop multiple titles or sequels to be part of our internal
product development effort.  All of our
product development efforts are managed under our “Greenlight Process,” a
formal, management control process for the selection, development and quality
assurance of our products.

We develop and
produce titles using a model in which a core group of creative, production and
technical professionals, in coordination with our marketing and finance
departments, have responsibility for the entire development and production
process including the supervision and coordination of internal and external
resources.  This team assembles the
necessary creative elements to complete a title using, where appropriate,
outside programmers, artists, animators, scriptwriters, musicians and
songwriters, sound effects and special effects experts, and sound and video
studios.  We believe that this model
allows us to supplement internal expertise with top quality external resources
on an as-needed basis.

In addition,
we often seek out and engage independent third-party developers to create
products on our behalf.  Such products
are sometimes owned by us, and usually we have unlimited rights to commercially
exploit these products.  In other
circumstances, the third-party developer may retain ownership of the
intellectual property and/or technology included in the product and reserve
certain exploitation rights. We typically select these independent third-party
developers based on their expertise in developing products in a specific
category and use the same developer to produce the same game for multiple
platforms.  Each of our third-party
developers is under contract with us for specific or multiple titles.  From time to time, we also license or
acquire software products that are independently created by third-party
developers and brought to us for publishing and/or distribution.  In such cases, the agreements with such
developers provide us with exclusive publishing and/or distribution rights for
a specific period of time, often for specified platforms and territories.  In either case, we often have the ability to
publish and/or distribute sequels, conversions, enhancements and add-ons to the
product initially being produced by the independent developer and frequently
have the right to engage the services of the original developer with regard to
the development of such products.

In
consideration for the services that the independent third-party developer
provides, it receives a royalty generally based on net sales of the product
that it has developed.  Typically, the
developer also receives an advance, which we recoup from the royalties
otherwise required to be paid to the developer.  The advance generally is paid in stages. The payment of each
stage is tied to the completion of a detailed performance milestone.  Working with independent developers allows
us to reduce our fixed development costs, share development risks with the
third-party developer, take advantage of third-party developers’ expertise in
connection with certain categories of products or certain platforms, and gain
access to proprietary development technologies.

From time to
time, we may make a capital investment and hold a minority interest in a
third-party developer in connection with entertainment software products to be
developed by such developer for us, which we believe helps to create a closer
relationship between us and the developer. 
For example, we have a minority interest in Infinity Ward and Pandemic
Studios.  We account for those capital
investments in which we have a 20% or greater ownership interest, such as
Infinity Ward, or over which we have the ability to exercise significant
influence, using the equity method.  For
those investments in which we hold less than a 20% ownership interest, such as
Pandemic Studios, or over which we do not have the ability to exercise
significant influence, we account for our investment using the cost
method.  There can be no assurance that
we will realize long-term benefits from such investments or that we will
continue to carry such investments at their current value.


“Greenlight Process”

We have
adopted and implemented a rigorous procedure for the selection, development,
production and quality assurance of our internally and externally produced
entertainment software titles. The process, known as the “Greenlight Process,”
involves five phases throughout the development and production phases of a
title, each of which includes a number of specific performance milestones.  The five phases of the “Greenlight Process”
are the concept phase, assessment phase, prototype phase, first playable phase
and alpha phase.  This procedure is
designed to enable us to manage and control production and development budgets
and timetables, to identify and address production and technical issues at the
earliest opportunity, and to coordinate marketing and quality control
strategies throughout the production and development phases, all in an
environment that fosters creativity. 
Checks and balances are intended to be provided through the structured
interaction of the project team with our creative, technical, marketing and
quality assurance/customer support personnel, as well as the legal, accounting
and finance departments.  In order to
maintain the competitiveness of our products and to take advantage of
increasingly sophisticated technology associated with new hardware platforms,
our development process includes a significant amount of time for play-testing
new products and extensive product quality evaluations.

Product Support

We provide
various forms of product support to both our internally and externally
developed titles.  Our quality assurance
personnel are involved throughout the development and production of each title
published by us.  All such products are
subjected to extensive testing before release in order to ensure compatibility
with all appropriate hardware systems and configurations and to minimize the
number of bugs and other defects found in the products.  To support our products after release, we provide
online access to our customers on a 24-hour basis as well as operator help
lines during regular business hours. 
The customer support group tracks customer inquiries, and this data is
used to help improve the development and production processes.

Publishing Activities

Marketing

Our marketing
efforts include online activities (such as the creation of World Wide Web pages
to promote specific titles), public relations, print and broadcast advertising,
coordinated in-store and industry promotions (including merchandising and point
of purchase displays) participation in cooperative advertising programs, direct
response vehicles, and product sampling through demonstration software
distributed through the Internet or on compact discs.  From time to time, we also receive marketing support from
hardware manufacturers and retailers in connection with their own promotional
efforts.  In addition, our products
contain software that enables customers to “electronically register” their
purchases with us online.

We believe
that certain of our franchise properties have loyal and devoted audiences who
purchase our sequels as a result of dedication to the property and satisfaction
from previous product purchases. 
Marketing of these sequels is therefore directed both toward the
established market as well as broader audiences.  In addition, in marketing titles based on licensed properties, we
believe that we derive benefits from the marketing and promotional activities
of the property owners.

Sales and Distribution

Domestic.

Our products are available for sale or
rental in thousands of retail outlets domestically.  Our domestic customers include Best Buy, Blockbuster, Circuit
City, Electronic Boutique, GameStop, Kay-Bee Toys, Target, Toys “R” Us and
Wal-Mart.  Our largest customer,
Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 16% and 14% of our consolidated net
revenues for fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively.

In the United
States and Canada, our products are sold primarily on a direct basis to
mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses and
office super-stores.  Our products are
sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party
distribution and licensing arrangements, and through our wholly-owned European
distribution subsidiaries.  We believe
that a direct relationship with retail accounts results in more effective
inventory management, merchandising and communications than would be possible
through indirect relationships.  We have
implemented electronic data interchange linkages with many of our retailers to
facilitate the placing and shipping of orders. 
We seek to continue to increase the number of retail outlets reached
directly through our internal


sales force.  We sell our products to distributors, such
as Ingram Entertainment, for distribution to independent channels.

International.

We conduct our international publishing
activities through offices in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada,
Sweden, Australia, and Japan.  We seek
to maximize our worldwide revenues and profits by releasing high quality
foreign language releases concurrently with English language releases, whenever
practicable, and by continuing to expand the number of direct selling
relationships we maintain with key retailers in major territories.  We sell directly to large retailers and
retail chains in the United Kingdom and Europe.  We also sell through third-party distributors in these
territories and throughout the world.

Affiliate Labels.

In addition to our own products, we
distribute interactive entertainment products that are developed and marketed
by other third-party publishers through our “affiliate label” programs in North
America and Europe. The distribution of other publishers’ products allows us to
increase the efficiencies of our sales force and provides us with the ability
to better ensure adequate shelf presence at retail stores for all of the
products that we distribute. We also mitigate the risk associated with a
particular title or titles published by us failing to achieve expectations.
Services provided by us under our affiliate label program include order
solicitation, in-store marketing, logistics and order fulfillment, sales
channel management, as well as other accounting and general administrative
functions. Our current affiliate label partners include LucasArts, as well
several affiliate label partners in our “value” business. Each affiliate label
relationship is unique and may pertain only to distribution in certain geographic
territories such as the United States or Europe and may be further limited only
to specific titles or titles for specific platforms.

Distribution

We distribute
interactive entertainment hardware and software products in Europe through our
European distribution subsidiaries, CentreSoft in the United Kingdom, NBG in
Germany and CD Contact in the Benelux countries.  These subsidiaries act as wholesalers in the distribution of
products and also provide packaging, logistical and sales services, and in some
cases, product localization for certain vendors.  They provide services to our publishing operations and to various
third-party publishers, including Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft.  CentreSoft is Sony’s exclusive distributor
of PlayStation products to the independent channel in the United Kingdom.  In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003,
sales for Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft accounted for approximately 32%, 7% and
5%, respectively, of our worldwide net distribution revenues.

We acquired
CentreSoft and NBG in 1997 and CD Contact in 1998.  We entered into the distribution business to obtain distribution
capacity in Europe for our own products, while supporting the distribution
infrastructure with third-party sales, and to diversify our operations into the
European market.  CentreSoft and our
other distribution subsidiaries operate in accordance with strict
confidentiality procedures in order to provide independent services to various
third-party publishers.

Online and Wireless
Technologies

We are
actively supporting emerging platforms, such as wireless devices and online
networks (closed and open) by publishing and licensing our titles for
them.  We also develop and optimize our
titles for consoles that support online play, such as PS2 and X-box.  Currently, we have released versions of

Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3

and

Tony Hawk’s
Pro Skater 4

for the PS2’s online service, as well as

Return to Castle Wolfenstein

for X-box
Live, Microsoft’s online service.  We
have published and licensed rights to various brands, such as

Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater

, for various
hand-held wireless devices, such as Nokia’s N-Gage wireless platform, as well
as a myriad of traditional wireless handsets. 
We believe that more of our brands will be successfully published in the
wireless and online space as those platforms continue to evolve.

Manufacturing

We prepare a
set of master program copies, documentation and packaging materials for our
products for each respective hardware platform on which the product will be
released.  Except with respect to
products for use on the Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft systems, our disk
duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly and
shipping are performed by third-party subcontractors.

To maintain
protection over their hardware technologies, Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft
generally specify or control the manufacturing and assembly of finished
products. We deliver the master materials to the licensor or its


approved replicator, which then
manufactures finished goods and delivers them to us for distribution under our
label.  At the time our product unit
orders are filled by the manufacturer, we become responsible for the costs of
manufacturing and the applicable per unit royalty on such units, even if the
units do not ultimately sell.

To date, we
have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the manufacture and
assembly of our products or material returns due to product defects.

Competition

The
interactive entertainment industry is extremely competitive.  The availability of significant financial
resources has become a major competitive factor in the industry primarily as a
result of the escalating development, acquisition, production and marketing
budgets required to publish quality titles. 
In addition, competitors with large product lines and popular titles
typically have greater leverage with retailers, distributors and other
customers who may be willing to promote titles with less consumer appeal in
return for access to such competitor’s most popular titles.

Employees

As of March
31, 2003, we had 1,214 employees, including 612 in product development, 118 in
North American publishing, 99 in international publishing, 108 in operations,
corporate finance and administration, and 277 in European distribution
activities.

As of March
31, 2003, 194 of our full-time employees were subject to term employment
agreements with us.  These agreements
generally commit such employees to employment terms of between one and five
years from the commencement of their respective agreements.  Most of the employees subject to such
agreements are executives or members of the product development, sales or
marketing divisions.  These individuals
perform services for us as executives, directors, producers, associate
producers, computer programmers, game designers, sales directors and marketing
product managers.  The execution by us
of employment agreements with such employees, in our experience, reduces our
turnover during the development and production of our entertainment software
products and allows us to plan more effectively for future development
activities.

None of our
employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement except for the
employees of our German distribution subsidiary who are allowed by German law
to belong to an organized labor council. 
To date, we have not experienced any labor-related work stoppages.

Factors Affecting Future
Performance

In connection
with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Litigation
Reform Act”), we are hereby disclosing certain cautionary information to be
used in connection with written materials (including this Annual Report on Form
10-K) and oral statements made by or on behalf of our employees and
representatives that may contain “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of the Litigation Reform Act. 
Such statements consist of any statement other than a recitation of
historical fact and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology
such as “may,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate” or “continue” or the negative
thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology.  The listener or reader is cautioned that all
forward-looking statements are necessarily speculative and there are numerous
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ
materially from those referred to in such forward-looking statements.  The discussion below highlights some of the
more important risks identified by management, but should not be assumed to be
the only factors that could affect future performance.  The reader or listener is cautioned that we
do not have a policy of updating or revising forward-looking statements and
thus he or she should not assume that silence by management over time means
that actual events are bearing out as estimated in such forward-looking
statements.

We depend on a relatively small
number of brands for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.

A significant
portion of our revenues is derived from products based on a relatively small
number of popular brands each year, and these products are responsible for a
disproportionate amount of our profits. 
In addition, many of these products have substantial production or acquisition
costs and marketing budgets.  In fiscal
2003, 38% of our consolidated net revenues (52% of worldwide publishing net
revenues) was derived from two brands, one of which accounted for 20% and the
other of which accounted for 18% of consolidated net revenues (27% and 25%,
respectively, of worldwide publishing net revenues).  In fiscal 2002, two brands accounted for 35% of our


consolidated net revenues (50%
of worldwide publishing net revenues), one of which accounted for 31% and the
other of which accounted for 4% of consolidated net revenues (44% and 6%,
respectively, of worldwide publishing net revenues).  We expect that a limited number of popular brands will continue
to produce a disproportionately large amount of our revenues.  Due to this dependence on a limited number
of brands, the failure to achieve anticipated results by one or more products
based on these brands may significantly harm our business and financial
results.

Our future success depends on our
ability to release popular products.

The life of
any one game product is relatively short, in many cases less than one
year.  It is therefore important for us
to be able to continue to develop many high quality new products that are
popularly received.  If we are unable to
do this, our business and financial results may be negatively affected.

We focus our
development and publishing activities principally on products that are, or have
the potential to become, franchise brand properties.  Many of these products are based on intellectual property and
other character or story rights acquired or licensed from third parties.  These license and distribution agreements
are limited in scope and time, and we may not be able to renew key licenses when
they expire or to include new products in existing licenses.  The loss of a significant number of our
intellectual property licenses or of our relationships with licensors could
have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop new products and therefore
on our business and financial results. 
Additionally, the failure of intellectual property acquired by us to be
popularly received could impact the market acceptance of our products in which
the intellectual property is included. 
Such lack of market acceptance could result in the write-off of the
unrecovered portion of acquired intellectual property assets, which could cause
material harm to our business and financial results.

have a material impact on the market for interactive entertainment software.

When new
console platforms are announced or introduced into the market, consumers
typically reduce their purchases of game console entertainment software
products for current console platforms in anticipation of new platforms
becoming available.  During these
periods, sales of our game console entertainment software products can be
expected to slow down or even decline until new platforms have been introduced
and have achieved wide consumer acceptance. 
Each of the three current principal hardware producers launched a new
platform in recent years.  Sony made the
first shipments of its PS2 console system in North America and Europe in the
fourth quarter of calendar year 2000. 
Microsoft made the first shipments of its Xbox console system in North
America in November 2001 and in Europe and Japan in the first quarter of
calendar 2002. Nintendo made the first shipments of its GameCube console system
in North America in November 2001 and in Europe in May 2002.  Additionally, in June 2001, Nintendo
launched its GBA hand-held device.  Most
recently, Sony announced that it would be entering the hand-held hardware
market with the introduction of its hand-held gaming device, PlayStation
Portable (“PSP”).  PSP is currently
expected to be released in the fourth quarter of calendar 2004.  We estimate that the next hardware
transition cycle will commence in late calendar 2005 or calendar 2006.  Delays in the launch, shortages, technical
problems or lack of consumer acceptance of these platforms and next generation
platforms could adversely affect our sales of products for these platforms.

We must make significant
expenditures to develop products for new platforms which may not be successful
or released when anticipated.

The
interactive entertainment software industry is subject to rapid technological
change.  New technologies could render
our current products or products in development obsolete or unmarketable.  We must continually anticipate and assess
the emergence and market acceptance of new interactive entertainment software
platforms well in advance of the time the platform is introduced to
consumers.  New platforms have
historically required the development of new software and also have the effect
of undermining demand for products based on older technologies.  Because product development cycles are
difficult to predict, we must make substantial product development and other
investments in a particular platform well in advance of introduction of the
platform.  If the platforms for which we
develop new software products or modify existing products are not released on a
timely basis or do not attain significant market penetration, or if we develop
products for a delayed or unsuccessful platform, we may not be able to recover
in revenues our development costs which could be significant and our business
and financial results could be significantly harmed.


We are exposed to seasonality in
the purchases of our products.

The
interactive entertainment software industry is highly seasonal, with the
highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the year-end holiday buying
season.  As a result, our net revenues,
gross profits and operating income have historically been highest during the
second half of the year.  Additionally,
in a platform transition period, sales of game console software products can be
significantly affected by the timeliness of introduction of game console
platforms by the manufacturers of those platforms, such as Sony, Microsoft and
Nintendo.  The timing of hardware
platform introduction is also often tied to holidays and is not within our
control.  If a hardware platform is
released unexpectedly close to the holidays, this would result in a shortened
holiday buying season and could negatively impact the sales of our
products.  Further, delays in
development, licensor approvals or manufacturing can also affect the timing of
the release of our products, causing us to miss key selling periods such as the
year-end holiday buying season.

We depend on skilled personnel.

Our success
depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify, hire and retain
skilled personnel.  The software
industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive
recruiting among competitors for personnel with technical, marketing, sales,
product development and management skills. 
We may not be able to attract and retain skilled personnel or may incur
significant costs in order to do so.  If
we are unable to attract additional qualified employees or retain the services
of key personnel, our business and financial results could be negatively
impacted.

We depend on Sony, Nintendo and
Microsoft for the manufacture of products that we develop for their hardware
platforms.

Generally,
when we develop interactive entertainment software products for hardware
platforms offered by Sony, Nintendo or Microsoft, the products are manufactured
exclusively by that hardware manufacturer or their approved replicator.  We pay a licensing fee to the hardware
manufacturer for each copy of a product manufactured for that manufacturer’s
game platform.

The agreements
with these manufacturers include certain provisions such as approval rights
over all products and related promotional materials and the ability to change
the fee they charge for the manufacturing of products, that allow them
substantial influence over our costs and the release schedule of our
products.  In addition, since each of
the manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware platforms
and manufactures products for all of its other licensees, a manufacturer may
give priority to its own products or those of our competitors in the event of
insufficient manufacturing capacity. 
Accordingly, Sony, Nintendo or Microsoft could cause unanticipated
delays in the release of our products as well increases to our development,
manufacturing, marketing or distribution costs, which could materially harm our
business and financial results.

If our products contain defects,
our business could be harmed significantly.

Software
products as complex as the ones we publish may contain undetected errors when
first introduced or when new versions are released.  Despite extensive testing prior to release, we cannot be certain
that errors will not be found in new products or releases after shipment, that
could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance.  This loss or delay could significantly harm
our business and financial results.

Inadequate intellectual property
protections could prevent us from enforcing or defending our proprietary
technology.

We regard our
software as proprietary and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and
trade secret laws, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other
methods to protect our proprietary rights. 
We own or license various copyrights and trademarks.  Although we provide “shrinkwrap” license
agreements or limitations on use with our software, it is uncertain to what
extent these agreements and limitations are enforceable.  We are aware that some unauthorized copying
occurs within the computer software industry, and if a significantly greater
amount of unauthorized copying of our interactive entertainment software
products were to occur, it could cause material harm to our business and
financial results.

Policing
unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and software piracy can be a
persistent problem, especially in some international markets.  Further, the laws of some countries where
our products are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and
intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the


United States, or are poorly
enforced.  Legal protection of our
rights may be ineffective in such countries. 
Moreover, as we leverage our software products using emerging
technologies such as the Internet and online services, our ability to protect
our intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing intellectual property
rights of others may diminish.  We
cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide
adequate protection for our products in connection with these emerging
technologies.

We may be subject to intellectual
property claims.

As the number
of interactive entertainment software products increases and the features and
content of these products continue to overlap, software developers increasingly
may become subject to infringement claims. 
Many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are
based on real world examples, which may inadvertently infringe upon the
intellectual property rights of others. 
Our products often utilize complex, cutting edge technology that may
become subject to the intellectual property rights of others.  Although we believe that we make reasonable
efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property
rights of others, it is possible that third parties still may claim
infringement.  From time to time, we
receive communications from third parties regarding such claims.  Existing or future infringement claims
against us, whether valid or not, may be time consuming and expensive to
defend.

Intellectual
property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the
following:

•

Cease
selling, incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the
challenged intellectual property;

•

Obtain a
license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which if
available at all, may not be available on commercially favorable terms; or

•

Redesign
the effected interactive entertainment software products, which could cause us
to incur additional costs, delay introduction and possibly reduce commercial
appeal of our products.

Any of these actions may cause
material harm to our business and financial results.

We rely on independent third
parties to develop some of our software products.

We rely on
independent third-party interactive entertainment software developers to
develop some of our software products. 
Since we depend on these developers in the aggregate, we remain subject
to the following risks:

•

Continuing
strong demand for developers’ resources, combined with the recognition they
receive in connection with their work, may cause developers who worked for us
in the past either to work for our competitors in the future or to renegotiate
our agreements with them on terms less favorable for us.

•

Limited
financial resources and business expertise and inability to retain skilled
personnel may force developers out of business prior to completing our products
or require us to fund additional costs.

•

Our
competitors may acquire the businesses of key developers or sign them to
exclusive development arrangements.  In
either case, we would not be able to continue to engage such developers’
services for our products, except for those that they are contractually
obligated to complete for us.

Increased
competition for skilled third-party software developers also has compelled us
to agree to make significant advance payments on royalties to game
developers.  If the products subject to
these arrangements do not generate sufficient revenues to recover these royalty
advances, we would have to write-off unrecovered portions of these payments,
which could cause material harm to our business and financial results.  Typically, we pay developers a royalty based
on a percentage of net revenue, less agreed upon deductions, but in a few
cases, we have agreed to pay developers fixed per unit product royalties after
royalty advances are fully recouped.  To
the extent that sales prices of products on which we have agreed to pay a fixed
per unit royalty are marked down, our profitability could be adversely
affected.


We operate in a highly competitive
industry.

The
interactive entertainment software industry is intensely competitive and new
interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly
introduced.  Our competitors vary in
size from small companies to very large corporations with significantly greater
financial, marketing and product development resources than we have.  Due to these greater resources, certain of
our competitors can spend more money and time on developing and testing
products, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive
pricing policies, pay higher fees to licensors for desirable motion picture,
television, sports and character properties and pay more to third-party
software developers than we can.  We
believe that the main competitive factors in the interactive entertainment software
industry include: product features and playability; brand name recognition;
compatibility of products with popular platforms; access to distribution
channels; quality of products; ease of use; price; marketing support; and
quality of customer service.

We compete
primarily with other publishers of personal computer and video game console
interactive entertainment software. 
Significant third-party software competitors currently include, among
others: Atari, Inc.; Capcom Co. Ltd.; Eidos PLC; Electronic Arts Inc.; Konami
Company Ltd.; Namco Ltd.; Sega Enterprises, Ltd.; Take-Two Interactive
Software, Inc.; THQ Inc.; Ubi Soft Entertainment and Vivendi Universal
Publishing.  In addition, integrated
video game console hardware and software companies such as Sony Computer
Entertainment, Nintendo Co. Ltd. and Microsoft Corporation compete directly
with us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms.

We also
compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities.  For example, we believe that the overall
growth in the use of the Internet and online services by consumers may pose a
competitive threat if customers and potential customers spend less of their
available time using interactive entertainment software and more using the
Internet and online services.

We may face difficulty obtaining
access to retail shelf space necessary to market and sell our products
effectively.

Retailers of
our products typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional
resources, and there is intense competition among consumer interactive
entertainment software products for high quality retail shelf space and
promotional support from retailers.  To
the extent that the number of products and platforms increases, competition for
shelf space may intensify and may require us to increase our marketing
expenditures.  Retailers with limited
shelf space typically devote the most and highest quality shelf space to those
products expected to be best sellers. 
We cannot be certain that our new products will consistently achieve
such “best seller” status.  Due to
increased competition for limited shelf space, retailers and distributors are
in an increasingly better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale,
including price discounts, price protection, marketing and display fees and
product return policies.  Our products
constitute a relatively small percentage of any retailer’s sales volume, and we
cannot be certain that retailers will continue to purchase our products or to
provide our products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional
support on acceptable terms.  A
prolonged failure in this regard may significantly harm our business and
financial results.

Our sales may decline
substantially without warning and in a brief period of time because we
generally do not have long-term contracts for the sale of our products.

In the United
States and Canada, we primarily sell our products on a direct basis to
mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses and
office super-stores.  Our products are
sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party
distribution and licensing arrangements and through our wholly-owned European
distribution subsidiaries.  Our sales
are made primarily on a purchase order basis without long-term agreements or
other forms of commitments.  Our largest
customer, Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 16% and 14% of our consolidated
net revenues for fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively.  The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any of our
principal retail customers or distributors could significantly harm our
business and financial results.

We may permit our customers to
return our products and to receive pricing concessions which could reduce our
net revenues and results of operations.

We are exposed
to the risk of product returns and price protection with respect to our
distributors and retailers. Return policies allow distributors and retailers to
return defective, shelf-worn and damaged products in accordance with terms
granted. Price protection, when granted and applicable, allows customers a
credit against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them.
We may permit product returns from, or grant price


protection to, our customers
under certain conditions.  The
conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products
or price protection are, among other things, compliance with applicable payment
terms, delivery to us of weekly inventory and sell-through reports, and
consistent participation in the launches of our premium title releases.  We may also consider other factors,
including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market
factors.   When we offer price protection,
we offer it with respect to a particular product to all of our retail
customers; however, only those customers who meet the conditions detailed above
can avail themselves of such price protection. 
We also offer a 90-day limited warranty to our end users that our
products will be free from manufacturing defects. Although we maintain a
reserve for returns and price protection, and although we may place limits on
product returns and price protection, we could be forced to accept substantial
product returns and provide substantial price protection to maintain our
relationships with retailers and our access to distribution channels. Product
returns and price protection that exceed our reserves could significantly harm
our business and financial results.

Limitations on the use of cookies to collect
information may reduce our ability to develop online profiles and aggregate
Internet user information.

Our technology
currently uses “cookies,” or small files of information placed on a user’s
computer, to collect information about an Internet user’s visits to various web
sites. This collection of behavioral information can be accomplished without
the user’s knowledge or consent. Most currently available Internet browsers
allow users to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being
stored on their computer without their knowledge. Users can also delete cookies
from their computer at any time, and widely-available software allows Internet
users to sweep all cookies from their computers. We are not aware of any
reliable method to ascertain whether Internet users are deleting their cookie
files. If a large number of Internet users refuse, disable or delete their
cookie files, the number of profiles to which we have access would decrease,
the collection of our statistics based on cookies would be impaired and the
value of our services based on these profiles and statistics would decrease.

Some privacy
advocates and governmental officials have suggested restricting or eliminating
the use of cookies without the Internet user’s consent. If we were required to
obtain consent before delivering a cookie or if the use or effectiveness of
cookies is limited, we would be required to switch to alternative technologies
to collect user profile information. Alternative technologies may be
unavailable or substantially less effective than cookies. Creating replacement
technology for cookies could require us to expend significant time and
resources. We may be unable to complete this alternative technology development
in time to avoid negative consequences to our business, and the replacement
methods we develop may not be commercially feasible.

We may be burdened with payment
defaults and uncollectible accounts if our distributors or retailers cannot
honor their credit arrangement with us.

Distributors
and retailers in the interactive entertainment software industry have from time
to time experienced significant fluctuations in their businesses, and a number
of them have failed.  The insolvency or
business failure of any significant retailer or distributor of our products
could materially harm our business and financial results.  We typically make sales to most of our
retailers and some distributors on unsecured credit, with terms that vary
depending upon the customer’s credit history, solvency, credit limits and sales
history, as well as whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance.  Although, as in the case with most of our
customers, we have insolvency risk insurance to protect against our customers’
bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation, this insurance contains a significant
deductible and a co-payment obligation, and the policy does not cover all
instances of non-payment.  In addition,
although we maintain a reserve for uncollectible receivables, the reserve may
not be sufficient in every circumstance. 
As a result, a payment default by a significant customer could
significantly harm our business and financial results.

We may not be able to maintain our
distribution relationships with key vendors.

Our CD
Contact, NBG and CentreSoft subsidiaries distribute interactive entertainment
software and hardware products and provide related services in the Benelux
countries, Germany and the United Kingdom, respectively, and via export, in
other European countries for a variety of entertainment software publishers,
many of which are our competitors, and hardware manufacturers.  These services are generally performed under
limited term contracts.  Although we
expect to use reasonable efforts to retain these vendors, we may not be
successful in this regard.  The
cancellation or non-renewal of one or more of these contracts could
significantly harm our business and financial results.  Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft products
accounted for approximately 32%, 7% and 5%, respectively, of our worldwide net
distribution revenues for fiscal 2003.


Our international revenues may be
subject to regulatory requirements as well as currency fluctuations.

Our
international revenues have accounted for a significant portion of our total
revenues.  International sales and
licensing accounted for 50%, 49% and 43% of our total net revenues in fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  We
expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant
portion of our total revenues in the future. 
International sales may be subject to unexpected regulatory
requirements, tariffs and other barriers. 
Additionally, foreign sales that are made in local currencies may
fluctuate. We have and may continue to engage in limited currency hedging
activities.  Although exposure to
currency fluctuations to date has been insignificant, fluctuations in currency
exchange rates may in the future have a material negative impact on revenues
from international sales and licensing and thus our business and financial
results.

Our software may be subject to
governmental restrictions or rating systems.

Legislation is
periodically introduced at the local, state and federal levels in the United
States and in foreign countries to establish a system for providing consumers
with information about graphic violence and sexually explicit material
contained in interactive entertainment software products.  In addition, many foreign countries have
laws that permit governmental entities to censor the content and advertising of
interactive entertainment software.  We
believe that mandatory government-run rating systems eventually may be adopted
in many countries that are significant markets or potential markets for our
products.  We may be required to modify
our products or alter our marketing strategies to comply with new regulations,
which could delay the release of our products in those countries.  Due to the uncertainties regarding such
rating systems, confusion in the marketplace may occur, and we are unable to
predict what effect, if any, such rating systems would have on our business.

In addition to
such regulations, certain retailers have in the past declined to stock some of
our products because they believed that the content of the packaging artwork or
the products would be offensive to the retailer’s customer base.  Although to date these actions have not
caused material harm to our business, we cannot assure you that similar actions
by our distributors or retailers in the future would not cause material harm to
our business.

Our software may be subject to
legal claims.

In prior
fiscal years, two lawsuits,

Linda Sanders, et al. v. Meow Media, Inc., et al.

,
United States District Court for the District of Colorado, and

Joe James,
et al. v. Meow Media, Inc., et al.

, United States District Court for
the Western District of Kentucky, Paducah Division, have been filed against
numerous video game companies, including us, by the families of victims who
were shot and killed by teenage gunmen in attacks perpetrated at schools.  These lawsuits allege that the video game
companies manufactured and/or supplied these teenagers with violent video
games, teaching them how to use a gun and causing them to act out in a violent
manner.  Both lawsuits referenced in
this paragraph have been dismissed. 
However, it is possible that similar, additional lawsuits may be filed
in the future.  Although our general liability
insurance carrier has agreed to defend us in such lawsuits, it is uncertain
whether the insurance carrier would cover all or any amounts which we might be
liable for if such future lawsuits are not decided in our favor.  If such future lawsuits are filed and
ultimately decided against us and our insurance carrier does not cover the
amounts we are liable for, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business and financial results.  Payment
of significant claims by insurance carriers may make such insurance coverage
materially more expensive or unavailable in the future, thereby exposing our
business to additional risk.

We may face limitations on our
ability to integrate additional acquired businesses or to find suitable
acquisition opportunities.

We intend to
pursue additional acquisitions of companies, properties and other assets that
can be purchased or licensed on acceptable terms and which we believe can be
operated or exploited profitably.  Some
of these transactions could be material in size and scope.  Although we continue to search for
additional acquisition opportunities, we may not be successful in identifying
suitable acquisitions.  As the
interactive entertainment software industry continues to consolidate, we face
significant competition in seeking and consummating acquisition
opportunities.  We may not be able to
consummate potential acquisitions or an acquisition may not enhance our
business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings.  In the future, we may issue additional
shares of our common stock in connection with one or more acquisitions, which
may dilute our existing shareholders. 
Future acquisitions could also divert substantial management time and
result in short-term reductions in earnings or special transaction or other
charges.  In addition, we cannot
guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate the businesses that we
may acquire into our existing business. 
Our shareholders may not have the opportunity to review, vote on or
evaluate future acquisitions.


Our shareholder rights plan,
charter documents and other agreements may make it more difficult to acquire us
without the approval of our Board of Directors.

We have
adopted a shareholder rights plan under which one right entitling the holder to
purchase one one-hundredths (1/100) of a share of our Series A Junior Preferred
Stock price at an exercise price of $40 per share (subject to adjustment) is
attached to each outstanding share of common stock.  Such shareholder rights plan makes an acquisition of control in a
transaction not approved by our Board of Directors more difficult.  Our Amended and Restated By-laws have
advance notice provisions for nominations for election of nominees to the Board
of Directors which may make it more difficult to acquire control of us.  Our long-term incentive plans provide for
acceleration of stock options following a change in control, which has the
effect of making an acquisition of control more expensive.  In addition, some of our officers have
severance compensation agreements that provide for substantial cash payments
and accelerations of other benefits in the event of a change in control.  These agreements and arrangements may also
inhibit a change in control and may have a negative effect on the market price
of our common stock.

Our reported financial results could be affected if significant changes
in current accounting principles are adopted.

Recent actions
and public comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission have focused on
the integrity of financial reporting generally. Similarly, Congress has
considered a variety of bills that could affect certain accounting principles.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board and other regulatory accounting
agencies have recently introduced several new or proposed accounting standards,
such as accounting for stock options, some of which represent a significant
change from current practices. Changes in our accounting for stock options
could materially increase our reported expenses.

Our stock price is highly
volatile.

The trading
price of our common stock has been and could continue to be subject to wide
fluctuations in response to many factors, including:

•

Quarter
to quarter variations in results of operations

•

Our
announcements of new products

•

Our
competitors’ announcements of new products

•

Our
product development or release schedule

•

General
conditions in the computer, software, entertainment, media or electronics
industries and in the economy

•

Timing
of the introduction of new platforms and delays in the actual release of new platforms

•

Changes
in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts

•

Investor
perceptions and expectations regarding our products, plans and strategic
position and those of our competitors and customers

In addition,
the public stock markets experience extreme price and trading volume
volatility, particularly in high technology sectors of the market.  This volatility has significantly affected
the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons often
unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies.  These broad market fluctuations may
adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

We seek to manage our business with a view to achieving long-term
results, and this could have a negative effect on short- term trading.

We focus on
creation of shareholder value over time, and we intend to make decisions that
will be consistent with this long-term view. 
As a result, some of our decisions, such as whether to make or
discontinue operating investments, manage our balance sheet and capital
structure, or pursue or discontinue strategic initiatives, may be in


conflict with the objectives of
short-term traders.  Further, this could
adversely affect our quarterly or other short-term results of operations.

We do not pay cash dividends on
our common stock.

We have not
paid any cash dividends on our common stock nor do we anticipate paying cash
dividends in the near future.

Item 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Our common
stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol “ATVI.”

The following
table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low reported sale
prices for our common stock.  As of June
9, 2003, there were approximately 2,900 holders of record of our common stock.

On June 9, 2003, the last
reported sales price of our common stock was $11.68.

Dividends

We paid no
cash dividends in 2003 or 2002 nor do we anticipate paying any cash dividends
at any time in the foreseeable future. 
We expect that earnings will be retained for the continued growth and
development of the business.  Future
dividends, if any, will depend upon our earnings, financial condition, cash
requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our Board
of Directors.

Stock Split

In April 2003,
the Board of Directors approved a three-for-two stock split effected in the
form of a 50% stock dividend.  The stock
split is payable at the close of business on June 6, 2003 to shareholders of
record as of May 16, 2003 and is effective as of the start of trading on June
9, 2003.

Sales of
Unregistered Equity Securities

Effective May
20, 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests of Z-Axis,
Ltd. (“Z-Axis”), a privately held interactive software development company, in
exchange for a combination of cash and 373,785 shares of our common stock.  Approximately 139,500 additional shares of
our common stock also may be issued to Z-Axis’ equity holders over the course
of several years, depending on the satisfaction of certain product performance
requirements and other criteria.

Effective
October 4, 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests of
Luxoflux Corp., (“Luxoflux”), a privately held interactive software development
company, in exchange for cash. 
Additionally, approximately 165,000 shares of our common stock may be
issued to Luxoflux’s equity holders and employees over the course of several
years, depending on the satisfaction of certain product performance
requirements and other criteria.

None of the
shares were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), by reason of the exemption under Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act.  We subsequently
registered the shares issued to


Z-Axis equity holders for
resale by those holders.  We are in
process of registering the shares issued in connection with the Luxoflux
transaction for resale by those holders.

Repurchase
Plan

During fiscal
2003, our Board of Directors authorized a buyback program under which we can
repurchase up to $350.0 million of our common stock. Under the program, shares
may be purchased as determined by management, from time to time, in the open
market or in privately negotiated transactions, including privately negotiated
structured option transactions and through transactions in the options markets.
Depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be
commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice.

As of March
31, 2003, we had repurchased approximately 10.8 million shares of our common
stock at an average cost of $9.39 per share. 
Additionally under the Board approved buyback program, we entered into a
series of structured stock repurchase transactions in the aggregate amount of
$110.0 million. These transactions may be settled in cash or stock depending on
the market price of our common stock on the date of the settlement. Upon
settlement, we will either have our capital investment returned with a premium
or receive up to approximately 12.8 million shares of our common stock,
depending, respectively, on whether the market price of our common stock is
above or below a pre-determined price agreed in connection with each such
transaction.

Shareholders’
Rights Plan

On April 18, 2000,
our Board of Directors approved a shareholders rights plan (the “Rights
Plan”).  Under the Rights Plan, each
common shareholder at the close of business on April 19, 2000 received a
dividend of one right for each share of common stock held.  Each right represents the right to purchase
one one-hundredths (1/100) of a share of our Series A Junior Preferred Stock at
an exercise price of $40.00.  Initially,
the rights are represented by our common stock certificates and are neither
exercisable nor traded separately from our common stock.  The rights will only become exercisable if a
person or group acquires 15% or more of the common stock of Activision, or
announces or commences a tender or exchange offer which would result in the
bidder’s beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock.

In the event
that any person or group acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock,
each holder of a right (other than such person or members of such group) will
thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such right, in lieu of
shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock, the number of shares of common stock
of Activision having a value equal to two times the then current exercise price
of the right.  If we are acquired in a
merger or other business combination transaction after a person has acquired
15% or more of our common stock, each holder of a right will thereafter have
the right to receive upon exercise of such right a number of the acquiring
company’s common shares having a market value equal to two times the then
current exercise price of the right. 
For persons who, as of the close of business on April 18, 2000,
beneficially own 15% or more of the common stock of Activision, the Rights Plan
“grandfathers” their current level of ownership, so long as they do not
purchase additional shares in excess of certain limitations.

We may redeem
the rights for $.01 per right at any time until the first public announcement
of the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 15% of our common stock.  At any time after a person has acquired 15%
or more (but before any person has acquired more than 50%) of our common stock,
we may exchange all or part of the rights for shares of common stock at an
exchange ratio of one share of common stock per right.  The rights expire on April 18, 2010.


Securities
Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans

Information
for our equity compensation plans in effect as of March 31, 2003 is as follows
(amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):

In April 2003,
our Board of Directors approved a 3.0 million share increase to the total
number of shares available for distribution under the Activision 2002 Incentive
Plan (the “2002 Plan”).  The 2002 Plan
permits the granting of awards to officers (other than executive officers),
employees, consultants, advisors and others. 
The increase in the 2002 Plan will not be submitted to Activision
shareholders for approval.

In April 2003,
our Board of Directors approved the Activision 2003 Incentive Plan (the “2003
Plan”).  The 2003 Plan permits the
granting of “Awards” in the form of non-qualified stock options, SARs,
restricted stock awards, deferred stock awards and other common stock-based
awards to directors, officers, employees, consultants and others.  The total number of shares of common stock
available for distribution under the 2003 Plan is 9,000,000. The 2003 Plan
became effective upon Board approval, but we intend to submit it for
shareholder ratification at the next annual meeting.

See Note 14 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for the
material features of each equity compensation plan that was adopted without
security holder approval.

Effective
April 1, 2001, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles.”  SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting
and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and other intangible
assets.  Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is
deemed to have an indefinite useful life and should not be amortized but rather
tested at least annually for


impairment.  In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we have not
amortized goodwill during the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002.  See Note 7 of Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8.


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We are a
leading international publisher of interactive entertainment software
products.  We have built a company with
a diverse portfolio of products that spans a wide range of categories and
target markets and that is used on a variety of game hardware platforms and
operating systems.  We have created,
licensed and acquired a group of highly recognizable brands which we market to
a growing variety of consumer demographics.

Our products
cover game categories such as action/adventure, action sports, racing,
role-playing, simulation, first-person action and strategy.  We currently offer our products in versions
that operate on the Sony PlayStation 2 (“PS2”), Sony PlayStation (“PS1”),
Nintendo GameCube (“GameCube”) and Microsoft Xbox (“Xbox”) console systems,
Nintendo Game Boy Advance (“GBA”) hand-held device and the personal computer
(“PC”).   In prior years, we have also
offered our products on the Nintendo 64 (“N64”) and Sega Dreamcast
(“Dreamcast”) console systems and Nintendo Game Boy Color (“GBC”) hand-held
device.  Sony recently announced that it
would be reentering the hand-held hardware market with the introduction of its
hand-held gaming device, PlayStation Portable (“PSP”).  PSP is currently expected to be released in
the fourth quarter of calendar 2004.  We
expect that we will develop titles for this new platform.

Our publishing
business involves the development, marketing and sale of products, either
directly, by license or through our affiliate label program with third-party
publishers.  In the United States, we
primarily sell our products on a direct basis to mass-market retailers,
consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses and office super-stores.  We conduct our international publishing
activities through offices in the United Kingdom (“UK”), Germany, France,
Australia, Sweden, Canada and Japan.  Our
products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through
third-party distribution and licensing arrangements and through our
wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries.  Our distribution business consists of operations located in the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany that provide logistical and sales services
to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own
publishing operations and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Our
profitability is directly affected by the mix of revenues from our publishing
and distribution businesses. Publishing operating margins are substantially
higher than margins realized from our distribution business.  Operating margins in our publishing business
are affected by our ability to release highly successful or “hit” titles.  Though many of these titles have substantial
production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets, once a title recoups
these costs, incremental net revenues directly and positively impacts operating
margin. Operating margins in our distribution business are affected by the mix
of hardware and software sales, with software producing higher margins than
hardware.

Our focus with respect to future game development will
be on big, well-established brands that we believe we can build into successful
game franchises such as our superheroes and action sports brands.   With regard to our superheroes brands, we
recently exercised an option to develop and publish the video game based on the
sequel to the “Spider-Man” movie which is expected to be theatrically released
in the spring of 2004.

Spider-Man: The Movie

was a key release
for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and has continued to perform strongly
throughout fiscal 2003.  In December
2002, we expanded our long-term alliance with Marvel Enterprises through an
exclusive, multi-year, licensing agreement that expires in 2009.  The agreement extends our exclusive rights
to develop and publish video games based on Marvel’s comic book franchises
Spider-Man, X-MEN, Fantastic Four and Iron Man.  The agreement additionally provides us the rights to develop
video games in conjunction with motion pictures and television series involving
X-MEN, Fantastic Four and Iron Man. 
Further, another of our key strategies is to continue to be a leader in
the action sports category.  In October
2002, we released

Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4

across multiple platforms.  We will
continue to promote our action sports franchises with the release of titles for
existing franchises such as

Tony Hawk’s
Underground

and

Street Hoops

and new action sports titles, such as

Wakeboarding
Unleashed

, as well as titles related to motor cross and
snowboarding.  We will also continue to
develop new intellectual properties, such as the upcoming titles

True Crime: Streets of L.A

. and

Call of Duty

, which we hope to establish
as franchise properties.

We will also
continue to evaluate emerging brands that we believe have potential to become
successful game franchises.  For
example, in August, 2002, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement to
develop and publish video games for the best-selling children’s book series,
Lemony Snicket’s “A Series of Unfortunate Events” which is being developed for
a feature film by Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies.  In December 2002, we also


entered into a multi-year,
multi-property, publishing agreement with DreamWorks SKG that grants us the
exclusive rights to publish video games based on DreamWorks SKG’s Shrek 2, and
three other upcoming computer-animated films, Sharkslayer, Madagascar and Over
the Hedge, as well as their sequels.

In addition to
acquiring or creating high profile intellectual property, we will also continue
our focus on establishing and maintaining relationships with talented and
experienced software development teams. 
During fiscal 2003, we bolstered our internal development capabilities
with the acquisitions of two privately held interactive software development
companies, Z-Axis and Luxoflux, as well as a 30% capital investment in a third,
Infinity Ward.  We have additionally
entered into development agreements with other top-level, third-party
developers such as id Software, Valve, Stainless Steel, Spark and Lionhead
Studios.

We intend to
utilize these developer relationships, new intellectual property acquisitions,
and our existing library of intellectual property to further focus our future
game development on big, well-established brands that we believe have the
potential to become franchise properties with sustainable consumer appeal and
brand recognition.  We also intend to
create a small number of new intellectual properties that we believe have the
potential to join this list of franchise properties.  Accordingly, we have chosen to eliminate certain smaller and
non-core projects from our development plan and expect to reduce the number of
titles to be released in fiscal 2004. 
Additionally, to maintain the competitiveness of our products and to
take advantage of increasingly sophisticated technology associated with new
hardware platforms, we intend to increase the amount of time spent play-testing
new products, to conduct more extensive product quality evaluations and to
lengthen product development schedules to allow time to make the improvements
indicated by our testing and evaluations. 
In many cases, this will result in an increase in future product
development costs.   Further, as a
result of the expected increase in the length of product development schedules,
the expected release dates of certain fiscal 2004 titles have been shifted to
fiscal 2005.

Critical Accounting
Policies

We have
identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the
understanding of our financial results. 
The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our
business operations is discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies
affect our reported and expected financial results.  For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other
accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8.  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period.  Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition.

We
recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of title and
risk of loss to our customers.  Revenue
from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for
returns and price protection.  We may
permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers on
unsold merchandise under certain conditions. 
Price protection, when granted and applicable, allows customers a credit
against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them.  With respect to license agreements that
provide customers the right to make multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed
amounts, revenue is recognized upon delivery of such copies. Per copy royalties
on sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned.  In addition, in order to recognize revenue
for both product sales and licensing transactions, persuasive evidence of an
arrangement must exist and collection of the related receivable must be probable.   Revenue recognition also determines the
timing of certain expenses, including cost of sales – intellectual property
licenses and cost of sales – software royalties and amortization.

Allowances for Returns, Price Protection,
Doubtful Accounts and Inventory Obsolescence.

We may permit product returns from, or grant
price protection to, our customers under certain conditions.    The conditions our customers must meet to
be granted the right to return products or price protection are, among other
things, compliance with applicable payment terms, delivery to us of weekly
inventory and sell-through reports, and consistent participation in the
launches of our premium title releases. 
We may also consider other factors, including the facilitation of
slow-moving inventory and other market factors. Management must make estimates
of potential future product returns and price protection related to current
period product revenue.  We estimate the
amount of future returns and price protection based upon historical experience,
customer inventory levels and changes in the demand and acceptance of our
products by the end consumer. 
Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in
connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in
any accounting period.


Material differences may result
in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes
different judgments or utilizes different estimates.

Similarly,
management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts
receivable.  In estimating the allowance
for doubtful accounts, we analyze historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes
in our customers’ payment terms and their economic condition, as well as
whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance.  Any significant changes in any of these criteria would impact
management’s estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts.

We value
inventory at the lower of cost or market. 
We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and in the retail
channel and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on the
future expected demand for our products. Significant changes in demand for our
products would impact management’s estimates in establishing our inventory
provision.

Software Development Costs.

Software
development costs include payments made to independent software developers
under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for internally
developed products.

We account for
software development costs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be
Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.” 
Software development costs are capitalized once technological
feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be
recoverable.  Technological feasibility
of a product encompasses both technical design documentation and game design
documentation.  For products where
proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle.
Technological feasibility is evaluated on a product-by-product basis.  Prior to a product’s release, we expense, as
part of cost of sales – software royalties and amortization, capitalized costs
when we believe such amounts are not recoverable.  Capitalized costs for those products that are cancelled or
abandoned are charged to product development expense.  Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized
are charged immediately to product development expense.  We evaluate the future recoverability of
capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis. 
The recoverability of
capitalized software development costs is evaluated based on the expected
performance of the specific products for which the costs relate.

The
following criteria are used to evaluate expected product performance:  historical performance of comparable
products using comparable technology; orders for the product prior to its
release; and estimated performance of a sequel product based on the performance
of the product on which the sequel is based.

Commencing
upon product release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to
cost of sales – software royalties and amortization based on the ratio of
current revenues to total projected revenues, generally resulting in an
amortization period of six months or less.  
For products that have been released in prior periods, we evaluate the future
recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.  The primary evaluation criterion is actual
title performance.

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when
technological feasibility is established, as well as in the ongoing assessment
of the recoverability of capitalized costs.

Intellectual Property Licenses.

Intellectual property license costs
represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of
their trademarks or copyrights in the development of our products.  Depending upon the agreement with the rights
holder, we may obtain the rights to use acquired intellectual property in
multiple products over multiple years, or alternatively, for a single product.

We evaluate the
future recoverability of capitalized intellectual property licenses on a
quarterly basis.  The recoverability of
capitalized intellectual property license costs is evaluated based on the
expected performance of the specific products in which the licensed trademark
or copyright is to be used.  As many of
our intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple
years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property
license costs based on certain qualitative factors such as the success of other
products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property,
whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series
based on the intellectual property and the rights holder’s continued promotion
and exploitation of the intellectual property. 
Prior to the related product’s release, we expense, as part of cost of
sales – intellectual property licenses, capitalized intellectual property costs
when we believe such amounts are not recoverable.  Capitalized intellectual property costs for those products that
are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense.   The following criteria are used to evaluate
expected product performance: 
historical performance of comparable products


using comparable technology;
orders for the product prior to its release; and estimated performance of a
sequel product based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is
based.

Commencing
upon the related product’s release, capitalized intellectual property license
costs are amortized to cost of sales – intellectual property licenses based on
the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected
revenues for all products in which the licensed trademark or copyright will be
utilized.  As intellectual property
license contracts may extend for multiple years, the amortization of
capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may
extend beyond one year.  For
intellectual property included in products that have been released, we evaluate
the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.  The primary evaluation criterion is actual
title performance.

Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the
assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs.


Selected
Consolidated Statements of Operations Data

The following
table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for the
periods indicated as a percentage of total net revenues and also breaks down
net revenues by territory and platform, as well as operating income by business
segment:


Results of Operations – Fiscal Years Ended
March 31, 2003 and 2002

Net income for
the year ended March 31, 2003 was $66.2 million or $0.64 per diluted share, as
compared to $52.2 million or $0.59 per diluted share for the year ended March
31, 2002.

Net Revenues

Net revenues
for the year ended March 31, 2003 increased 10% from the prior fiscal year,
from $786.4 million to $864.1 million. 
This increase was generated by our publishing business and, to a lesser
degree, our distribution business.

Publishing net
revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 increased 12% from the prior fiscal
year, from $549.5 million to $616.0 million. 
The following table details our publishing net revenues by platform as a
percentage of total publishing net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2003
and 2002:

There were
several factors that affected the fiscal 2003 net revenue performance of our
publishing business.  First, positively
impacting our performance, was an improvement in console sales. Our publishing
console net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 increased 49% from the
prior fiscal year, from $313.0 million to $466.1 million.  Fiscal 2003 publishing console net revenues
reflect the simultaneous cross-platform, multi-national releases of

Spider-Man:
The Movie

in the first quarter and

Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4

in
the third quarter.   In addition
publishing console net revenue performance was also driven by the following
releases:

Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven, Street
Hoops 2

and

Cabela’s Big Game
Hunter

for PS2.   Second,
publishing hand-held net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 decreased
by 58% from the prior fiscal year, from $119.2 million to $50.0 million.  This decrease reflects the fact that the GBA
hardware was launched in June 2001.  Our
GBA software sales for the year ended March 31, 2002 benefited from the related
hardware launch.  We also released fewer
titles for the hand-held platforms in fiscal 2003 - 11 titles, in comparison to
19 titles in fiscal 2002.  
Additionally, the average retail price of titles for hand-held devices
was lower in fiscal 2003 than in fiscal 2002. 
Third, PC net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 decreased 15%
from the prior fiscal year, from $117.3 million to $99.9 million.  Though the number of PC titles released in
fiscal 2003 was relatively consistent with fiscal 2002, during fiscal 2002, we
released

Return to Castle Wolfenstein

for the PC, which was one of our top performing titles of fiscal 2002.  PC net revenues for the year ended March 31,
2002 reflect that title’s worldwide, strong performance.  Lastly, net revenues from our international
publishing business for the year ended March 31, 2003 benefited by
approximately $14.1 million from a year-over-year strengthening of the Euro and
the Great British Pound (“GBP”) in relation to the U.S. dollar.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations, our domestic publishing business and our international publishing
business experienced similar year-over-year improvements for the reasons
detailed above.

The platform
mix of our future publishing net revenues will be impacted by a number of
factors, including the ability of hardware manufacturers to continue to
increase their installed hardware bases, the introduction of new hardware
platforms, as well as the timing of key product releases from our own product
release schedule.  We expect


that net revenues from console
titles will continue to represent the largest component of our publishing net
revenues with PS2 having the largest percentage of that business due to its
larger installed hardware base.  We
expect net revenues from hand-held titles to remain the smallest component of
our publishing net revenues.  However,
with the introduction of PSP in fiscal 2005, we may see an increase in our
hand-held business over fiscal 2003. 
Our net revenues from PC titles will be primarily driven by our product
release schedule.

A significant
portion of our revenues and profits are derived from a relatively small number
of popular titles and brands each year as revenues and profits are
significantly affected by our ability to release highly successful or “hit”
titles.   For example, for the year
ended March 31, 2003, 30% of our consolidated net revenues and 43% of worldwide
publishing net revenues were derived from net revenues from our

Spider-Man: 
The Movie

and

Tony Hawk’s
Pro Skater 4

titles.  Though
many of these titles have substantial production or acquisition costs and
marketing budgets, once a title recoups these costs, incremental net revenues
directly and positively impacts operating profits resulting in a
disproportionate amount of operating income being derived from these select
titles.   We expect that a limited
number of titles and brands will continue to produce a disproportionately large
amount of our net revenues and profits.

As discussed
in the “Overview” section of Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in connection with our focus of
future game development on big, well-established brands that we believe have
the potential to become game franchise properties with sustainable consumer
appeal, we have chosen to eliminate certain smaller and non-core projects from
our development plan and expect to reduce the number of titles released in
fiscal 2004.  Further, as a result of an
expected increase in the length of product development schedules, the expected
release dates of certain fiscal 2004 titles have been shifted to fiscal
2005.  Because of these and other
factors, we currently expect fiscal 2004 net revenues to be less than those of
fiscal 2003, but we currently expect that we will resume net revenue growth in
fiscal 2005.

Another factor
that could affect fiscal 2004 net revenue performance is software pricing.  While we expect console launch pricing to
hold at $49.99 through the holidays, we believe that we could see price
declines thereafter.

Distribution
net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 increased 5% from the prior
fiscal year, from $236.9 million to $248.1 million.  The increase was due to the positive impact of the year-over-year
strengthening of the Euro and the GBP in relation to the U.S. dollar.  Distribution console net revenues for the
year ended March 31, 2003 also benefited from the international hardware
launches of Xbox and GameCube in March 2002 and May 2002, respectively.  It additionally benefited from the price
reduction on PS2 hardware that was effective September 2001, as this resulted
in both an increase in sales of PS2 hardware, as well as an increase in sales
of PS2 software due to the corresponding larger installed hardware base.  This increase was partially offset by
declines in distribution hand-held and PC net revenues for the reasons detailed
in the discussion of publishing net revenues. 
The mix of distribution net revenues between hardware and software sales
remained relatively constant year-over-year at approximately 38% hardware and
62% software.  The mix of future
distribution net revenues will be driven by a number of factors including the
occurrence of hardware price reductions instituted by hardware manufacturers,
the introduction of new hardware platforms and our ability to establish and
maintain distribution agreements with hardware manufacturers and third-party
software publishers.  We expect software
sales as a percentage of total distribution net revenues in fiscal 2004 to
increase slightly from fiscal 2003.

Domestic net
revenues increased 7% from $404.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2002, to
$432.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2003 for the reasons detailed above
in the discussion of our publishing business net revenues.   International net revenues increased by 13%
from $381.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2002, to $431.9 million for
the year ended March 31, 2003 for the reasons detailed above in the discussion
of our publishing business, as well as the result of the year-over-year
strengthening of the Euro and the GBP in relation to the U.S. dollar.

Costs and Expenses

Cost of sales
– product costs represented 51% and 56% of consolidated net revenues for the
year ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  There were two primary factors that affected cost of sales –
product costs as a percentage of consolidated net revenues.  First, the product mix of our publishing
business for the year ended March 31, 2003 reflects a lower proportion of net
revenues from titles for hand-held devices, as compared to the year ended March
31, 2002.  Titles for hand-held devices
generally have the highest manufacturing per unit cost of all platforms.


Second, our
manufacturing costs for console titles for the year ended March 31, 2003
benefited from the economies of scale due to the high volume of

Spider-Man:
The Movie

units manufactured.

Cost of sales – software royalties and amortization for the year ended
March 31, 2003 increased as a percentage of publishing net revenues from the
prior fiscal year, from 11% to 13%.  In
absolute dollars, cost of sales – software royalties and amortization for the
year ended March 31, 2003 also increased from the prior fiscal year, from $58.9
million to $79.2 million.  The increases
reflect the change in the product mix of our publishing business.  Though titles for hand-held devices
generally have the highest per unit manufacturing cost of all platforms, they
have the lowest product development cost structure.  In the year ended March 31, 2002 in which titles for hand-held
devices accounted for a higher proportion of publishing net revenues, the
related cost of sales – software royalties and amortization was correspondingly
low.  This is in comparison to the year
ended March 31, 2003 in which console titles accounted for a higher proportion
of publishing net revenues.  Console
titles such as PS2, Xbox and GameCube have high product development cost structures,
and the release of titles on these platforms will result in a correspondingly
high cost of sales – software royalties and amortization.  In addition, we recorded during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 approximately $8.0 million related to an assessment of
the recoverability of capitalized development costs pertaining to certain
products.

Cost of sales – intellectual property licenses for the year ended March
31, 2003 remained constant as a percentage of publishing net revenues with the
prior fiscal year at 7%.  In absolute
dollars, cost of sales – intellectual property licenses for the year ended
March 31, 2003 increased from the prior fiscal year, from $40.1 million to
$45.0 million.   During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded an approximate $7.0 million related to an
assessment of the recoverability of certain of our investments in long-term
licensing agreements.  We recorded
additional costs relating to common stock warrants issued in connection with
those licensing agreements.  The impact
of these costs was partially offset by the fact that one of our top performing
titles released in fiscal 2002 had a higher intellectual property royalty rate
structure than the majority of the top performing titles released in fiscal
2003.

Product development expenses for the year ended March 31, 2003
increased as a percentage of publishing net revenues from the prior fiscal
year, from 7% to 9%. In absolute dollars, product development expense for the
year ended March 31, 2003 also increased from the prior fiscal year, from $41.0
million to $57.0 million.  These
increases reflect the change in the product mix of titles in development - more
console and less hand-held - during fiscal 2003.  The cost to develop titles for current console systems, such as
PS2, Xbox and GameCube, is higher than the cost to develop titles for the
legacy console systems and hand-held devices. 
Additionally, we had more titles in development during fiscal 2003 than
fiscal 2002.  Lastly, in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003, we decided to eliminate certain smaller and non-core
projects from our future development plan. 
The cost relating to the cancellation of those titles was approximately
$2.6 million.

As discussed in the “Overview” section of Item 7 “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in
order to maintain the competitiveness of our products and to take advantage of
increasingly sophisticated technology associated with new hardware platforms,
we intend to increase the amount of time spent play-testing new products, to
conduct more extensive product quality evaluations and to lengthen product
development schedules to allow time to make the improvements indicated by the
testing and evaluations.  In many cases,
this will result in an increase in future product development costs.

Sales and marketing expenses of $100.6 million and $86.2 million
represented 12% and 11% of consolidated net revenues for the year ended March
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  The
increase in sales and marketing expense dollars for the year ended March 31,
2003 from the prior fiscal year was the result of increased costs in both our
publishing and distribution businesses. 
The increase in sales and marketing expense dollars in our publishing
business was the result of a significant marketing program in support of the
simultaneous cross-platform, multi-national release of

Spider-Man:  The Movie

during the first quarter of fiscal 2003, as
well as increased TV and print ads in support of second, third and fourth
quarter releases such as

Street Hoops,
Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4

and

Tenchu:  Wrath of Heaven

.  Additionally, in the year ended March 31,
2003, we provided sponsorship for select action sports tours/tournaments in
support of our Activision action sports brands.   The increase in sales and marketing expense dollars in our
distribution business was due to an increasing percentage of our distribution
business being generated from large national accounts.  Such large national accounts generally
result in increased sales costs.


General and
administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2003 increased $2.5
million from the prior fiscal year, from $44.0 million to $46.5 million.  As a percentage of consolidated net
revenues, general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant
year-over-year at approximately 5% to 6% as a result of our continued focus on
building operating efficiencies and controlling costs.  The increase in absolute dollars was
primarily due to the incurrence in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 of an
approximate $2.0 million charge for the relocation of our UK distribution
facility due to the increased growth of our UK distribution and UK publishing
businesses.

Operating Income

Operating
income for the year ended March 31, 2003 was $94.8 million, compared to $80.6
million in the prior fiscal year.  The
increase reflects improvements in both our publishing and distribution
businesses.  Publishing operating income
improvement reflects, as previously discussed, the benefits generated by the
release of hit titles, the decrease in cost of sales – product costs due to
changes in product mix and our continued focus on building operating
efficiencies and controlling costs. Distribution operating income improvement includes
the distribution of a very successful third-party publisher’s title in several
countries and reductions in headcount related expenses.

Investment Income, Net

Investment
income, net for the year ended March 31, 2003 was $8.6 million as compared to $2.5
million for the year ended March 31, 2002. 
The increase is primarily due to higher average cash and short-term
investment balances during fiscal 2003, partially offset by lower market rates.

Provision for Income
Taxes

The income tax provision of $37.2 million for the year ended March 31,
2003 reflects our effective income tax rate of 36%.  The significant items that generated the variance between our
effective rate and our statutory rate of 35% were state taxes and an increase
in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, partially offset by research and
development tax credits and the impact of foreign tax rate differentials.  The realization of deferred tax assets
depends primarily on the generation of future taxable income.  We believe that it is more likely than not
that we will generate taxable income sufficient to realize the benefit of net
deferred tax assets recognized.

Results of Operations
– Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2002 and 2001

Net income for
the year ended March 31, 2002 was $52.2 million or $0.59 per diluted share, as
compared to $20.5 million or $0.33 per diluted share for the year ended March
31, 2001.

Net Revenues

Net revenues
for the year ended March 31, 2002 increased 27% from the prior fiscal year,
from $620.2 million to $786.4 million. 
This increase was driven by the performance of both our publishing
business and our distribution business.

Publishing net
revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002 increased 18% from $466.1 million to
$549.5 million.  This increase primarily
was due to publishing console and hand-held net revenues, combined, increasing
24% from $349.5 million to $432.2 million. 
The increase in publishing console and hand-held net revenues was
attributable to the release in fiscal 2002 of several titles for next
generation platforms (PS2, Xbox, GameCube, GBA) that sold very well in both the
domestic and international marketplaces, as well as continuing strong worldwide
sales for titles released on legacy platforms. 
Such titles included

Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3

for PS2, GameCube
and PS1,

Tony
Hawk’s Pro Skater 2

for GBA, N64 and PS1,

Wreckless

:

The Yakuza Missions

for Xbox, as well as

Mat
Hoffman’s Pro BMX

for PS1, GBA and GBC. A significant portion of our
revenues is derived from products based on a relatively small number of popular
brands each year.  In fiscal 2002, 50%
of our worldwide net publishing revenues (35% of consolidated net revenues) was
derived from two brands, one of which accounted for 44% and the other of which
accounted for 6% of worldwide net publishing revenues (31% and 4%,
respectively, of consolidated net revenues). 
In fiscal 2001, two brands accounted for 49% of our worldwide net
publishing revenues (37% of consolidated net revenues), one of which accounted
for 39% and the other of which accounted for 10% of worldwide net publishing
revenues (29% and 8%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues).  We expect that a limited number of popular
brands will continue to produce a disproportionately large amount of our
revenues. In fiscal 2002, 56% of 
publishing console and hand-held net revenues were derived from sales of
titles for next generation platforms while


44% were derived from sales of titles for legacy platforms (PS1, N64,
Dreamcast, GBC).  When new console
platforms are announced or introduced into the market, consumers typically
reduce their purchases of game console entertainment software products for
current console platforms in anticipation of new platforms becoming available.  We expect sales from existing generation
platform titles to decline and sales from next generation platform titles to
increase as the installed base of next generation platforms grows.  Publishing PC net revenues for the year
ended March 31, 2002 remained relatively consistent with the prior year,
increasing from $116.5 million to $117.3 million.  Our PC business was flat primarily due to the fact that, despite
the successful launch of

Return to Castle Wolfenstein

for the PC in
the third quarter of fiscal 2002, there were fewer premium PC titles released
in the year ended March 31, 2002, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2001.

Distribution
net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002 increased 54% from the prior
fiscal year, from $154.1 million to $236.9 million, primarily driven by an
increase in our distribution console and hand-held net revenues.  Distribution console and hand-held net
revenues, combined, for the year ended March 31, 2002 increased 77% over the
prior fiscal year, from $117.4 million to $207.6 million.  We are the sole distributor of Sony products
in the independent channel in the UK. 
Accordingly, we benefited from the price reduction on PS2 hardware that
was effective September 2001, as this resulted in both an increase in sales of
PS2 hardware, as well as an increase in sales of PS2 software due to the
corresponding larger installed hardware base. 
Additionally, in fiscal 2002, we began distributing Nintendo products
within the UK. These items, along with the improved market conditions in
Europe, have resulted in the continued improvements in our distribution
business.

Domestic net
revenues grew 15% from $352.9 million to $404.9 million.  International net revenues increased by 43%
from $267.3 million to $381.5 million. 
The increase in domestic net revenues is reflective of the improvements
in our publishing business as described above, and the increase in
international net revenues is reflective of the improvements in our publishing
and distribution businesses as described above.

Costs and Expenses

Cost of sales
– product costs represented 56% and 52% of consolidated net revenues for the
year ended March 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  The increase in cost of sales – product costs as a percentage of
consolidated net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002 was due to the
increase in distribution net revenues as a percentage of total consolidated net
revenues, as well as a change in the product mix of our publishing
business.  Distribution net revenues
have a higher per unit cost as compared to publishing net revenues.  The product mix of our publishing business
for the year ended March 31, 2002 reflects a heavier concentration of console
products and hand-held devices.  Console
products generally have a higher manufacturing per unit cost than PCs.  Products for hand-held devices generally
have the highest manufacturing per unit cost of all platforms.

Cost of sales
– software royalties and amortization remained flat at 11% of publishing net
revenues for the years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001.

Cost of sales
– intellectual property licenses decreased as a percentage of publishing net
revenues to 7% for the year ended March 31, 2002, from 9% for the year ended
March 31, 2001.  The decrease is
reflective of the fact that in the year ended March 31, 2001, several of our
top performing titles were products with high intellectual property royalty
rates.

Product
development expenses of $41.0 million and $41.4 million represented 7% and 9%
of publishing net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.  The decrease in product
development expenses as a percentage of publishing net revenue is reflective of
the fact that during the year ended March 31, 2002, a higher proportion of
product development expenditures were incurred subsequent to the establishment
of technological feasibility as compared to the prior fiscal year in which more
product development expenditures were incurred prior to the establishment of
technological feasibility and were, accordingly, charged directly to product
development expense.  In addition, our
“Greenlight Process” for the selection, development, production and quality
assurance of our products has exercised rigorous control over product development
expenditures.

Sales and
marketing expenses of $86.2 million and $85.4 million represented 11% and 14%
of consolidated net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.  This decrease as a
percentage of consolidated net revenues reflects our ability to generate
savings by building on the existing awareness of our branded products and
sequel titles sold during fiscal 2002. 
It also reflects the savings we receive from the increased success of
releasing a higher proportion of our branded products simultaneously on
multiple platforms.


General and
administrative expense for the year ended March 31, 2002 increased 13%, from
$39.0 million to $44.0 million.  As a
percentage of consolidated net revenues, general and administrative expenses
remained relatively constant at approximately 6%.  The increase in the dollar amount of general and administrative
expenses was due to an increase in worldwide administrative support needs and
headcount related expenses.  Partially
offsetting this increase was a decrease in amortization of intangibles, which
is included in general and administrative expenses, from $1.5 million for the
year ended March 31, 2001 to zero for the year ended March 31, 2002.  Effective April 1, 2001, we adopted the provisions
of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles.”  SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting
requirements for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets.  Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is deemed to
have an indefinite useful life and should not be amortized but rather tested at
least annually for impairment.  As such,
we did not record goodwill amortization for the year ended March 31, 2002.

Operating Income

Operating
income for the year ended March 31, 2002, was $80.6 million, compared to $39.8
million in the prior fiscal year.  The
increase in operating income for the year ended March 31, 2002 over the prior
fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the success of our publishing business
due to branding, cross platform releases and operating efficiencies obtained
via the leveraging of our infrastructure and, to a lesser degree, an increase
in our distribution business resulting from the growth of the next generation
hardware and software markets.

Investment Income, Net

Investment
income, net changed to $2.5 million of investment income for the year ended
March 31, 2002, from $7.3 million of interest expense for the year ended March
31, 2001.  This change was due to our
improved cash position in fiscal 2002 resulting in higher investment income,
the elimination of bank borrowings and the conversion and/or redemption of our
$60.0 million convertible subordinated notes in the first quarter of fiscal
2002.

Provision for Income
Taxes

The income tax
provision of $30.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2002, reflects our
effective income tax rate of approximately 37%.  The significant items generating the variance between our
effective rate and our statutory rate of 35% are state taxes and an increase in
our deferred tax asset valuation allowance which is partially offset by
research and development tax credits and the impact of foreign tax rate
differentials.  The realization of
deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable
income.  We believe that it is more
likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the
benefit of net deferred tax assets recognized.

Quarterly Operating
Results

Our quarterly
operating results have in the past varied significantly and will likely vary significantly
in the future, depending on numerous factors, several of which are not under
our control.    See Item 1 “Business –
Factors Affecting Future Performance.” 
Our business also has experienced and is expected to continue to
experience significant seasonality, largely due to consumer buying patterns and
our product release schedule focusing on those patterns.  Net revenues typically are significantly
higher during the fourth calendar quarter, primarily due to the increased
demand for consumer software during the year-end holiday buying season.  Accordingly, we believe that
period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily
meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.


The following
table is a comparative breakdown of our quarterly results for the immediately
preceding eight quarters (amounts in thousands, except per share data):

(1)

Consolidated
financial information has been restated for the effect of our three-for-two
stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend to shareholders of
record as of May 16, 2003, payable June 6, 2003.

See
Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Software Development
Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses” of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of March 31, 2003, our primary source of liquidity is comprised of
$285.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $121.4 million of short-term
investments.  We believe that we have
sufficient working capital ($422.5 million at March 31, 2003), as well as
proceeds available from our international credit facilities (described below),
to finance our operational requirements for at least the next twelve months,
including purchases of inventory and equipment, the funding of the development,
production, marketing and sale of new products and the acquisition of
intellectual property rights for future products from third parties.

We actively manage our capital structure and balance sheet as a
component of our overall business strategy. 
When we determine that market conditions are appropriate, we may seek to
achieve long term value for the shareholders through, among other things, new
debt or equity financings or refinancings, share repurchases and other
transactions involving our equity or debt securities.

Cash Flows

Our cash and cash equivalents were $285.6 million at March 31, 2003
compared to $279.0 million at March 31, 2002. 
Activity in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended March 31, 2003,
included $91.0 million and $64.1 million provided by operating and financing
activities, respectively, offset by $155.1 million utilized in investing
activities.  The principal components
comprising cash flows from operating activities included favorable operating
results, tax benefits from stock option and warrant exercises and decreases in
accounts receivable, partially offset by the timing of payments on accounts
payable and our continued investment in software development and intellectual
property licenses.  We spent approximately
$151.6 million and $77.0 million in the year ended March 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, in connection with the acquisition of publishing or distribution
rights for products being developed by third parties, the execution of new
license agreements granting us long-term rights to intellectual property of
third parties, as well as the capitalization of product development costs
relating to internally developed products. 
We expect that we will continue to make significant expenditures
relating to our investment in software development and intellectual property
licenses.

The cash used in investing activities primarily was the result of the
investment of excess cash balances into short-term investment vehicles.  The goal of our short-term investments is to
maximize return while minimizing risk, maintaining liquidity, coordinating with
anticipated working capital needs and providing for prudent investment
diversification.  Cash used in investing
activities was also the result of business combinations and equipment
purchases.  On May 20, 2002, we acquired
all of the outstanding ownership interests of Z-Axis, Ltd. (“Z-Axis”), a
privately held interactive software development company, in exchange for $12.5
million in cash and 373,785 shares of our common stock valued at approximately
$8.2 million. Then, on October 4, 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding
ownership interests of Luxoflux Inc. (“Luxoflux”), a privately held interactive
software development company, in exchange for $9.0 million in cash.  We have historically financed our
acquisitions through the issuance of shares of common stock or a combination of
common stock and cash. We will continue to evaluate potential acquisition
candidates as to the benefit they bring to us and as to our ability to make
such acquisitions.


The cash provided by financing activities primarily is the result of
proceeds from the June 7, 2002 issuance of 11,250,000 shares of our common
stock for proceeds of approximately $247.3 million, net of offering costs,
partially offset by cash used to purchase treasury stock and enter into
structured stock repurchase transactions.  
During fiscal 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a buyback program
under which we can repurchase up to $350.0 million of our common stock. Under
the program, shares may be purchased as determined by management, from time to
time, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including
privately negotiated structured option transactions and through transactions in
the options markets. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these
purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time
without prior notice.  As of March 31,
2003, we had repurchased approximately 10.8 million shares of our common stock
at an average cost of $9.39 per share for which $93.8 million was settled in
cash as of March 31, 2003 and $7.6 million was settled in cash in April
2003.  Additionally, under the Board
approved buyback program, we entered into a series of structured stock
repurchase transactions in the aggregate amount of $110.0 million. These
transactions may be settled in cash or stock depending on the market price of
our common stock on the date of the settlement. Upon settlement, we will either
have our capital investment returned with a premium or receive up to
approximately 12.8 million shares of our common stock, depending, respectively,
on whether the market price of our common stock is above or below a
pre-determined price agreed in connection with each such transaction.

Credit Facilities

We currently have revolving credit facilities with our CentreSoft
subsidiary located in the United Kingdom (the “UK Facility”) and our NBG
subsidiary located in Germany (the “German Facility”).  As of March 31, 2003, the UK Facility
provided Centresoft with the ability to borrow up to Great British Pounds
(“GBP”) 8.6 million ($13.5 million), including issuing letters of credit, on a
revolving basis. Furthermore, as of March 31, 2003, under the UK Facility,
Centresoft provided a EUR 1.0 million ($1.1 million) guarantee for the benefit
of our CD Contact subsidiary.  The UK
Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.5%, is collateralized by substantially all
of the assets of the subsidiary and expires in October 2003.  The UK Facility also contains various
covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios
related to, among others, fixed charges. 
As of March 31, 2003, we were in compliance with these covenants.  No borrowings were outstanding against the
UK Facility as of March 31, 2003.  The
German Facility provided for revolving loans up to EUR 0.8 million ($0.8
million) as of March 31, 2003, bears interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus 2.5%,
is collateralized by the subsidiary’s accounts receivable, inventory and
certain property and equipment and expires June 2003.  No borrowings were outstanding against the German Facility as of
March 31, 2003.

Commitments

In connection with our purchases of Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy
software for distribution in North America and Europe, Nintendo requires us to
provide either standby letters of credit or cash prepayment prior to accepting
purchase orders.  As of March 31, 2003,
there were no drawdowns on standby letters of credit.

In the normal
course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties
for the development of products, as well as for the rights to intellectual
property.  Under these agreements, we
commit to provide specified payments to a developer or intellectual property
holder, based upon contractual arrangements. 
Assuming all contractual provisions are met, the total future minimum
contract commitment for contracts in place as of March 31, 2003 is approximately
$138.1 million and is scheduled to be paid as follows (amounts in thousands):


Inflation

Our management
currently believes that inflation has not had a material impact on continuing
operations.

Recently Issued
Accounting Standards

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and
Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123.”  SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation.  It also requires
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results.  SFAS No. 148
is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2002.  We adopted SFAS 148 in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003.  As we elected
not to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation, the adoption of SFAS No. 148 did not have an impact upon
our financial condition or results of operations.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement
133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”  SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies the
accounting guidance on derivative instruments (including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts) and hedging activities that fall
within the scope of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.”  SFAS No. 149 is
effective for all contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, with
certain exceptions, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30,
2003.  The guidance is to be applied
prospectively.  We are currently
assessing the impact of SFAS No. 149 on our financial position and results of
operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.”  SFAS No. 150 changes the
accounting guidance for certain financial instruments that, under previous
guidance, could be classified as equity or “mezzanine” equity by now requiring
those instruments to be classified as liabilities (or assets in some
circumstances) in the statement of financial position.  Further, SFAS No. 150 requires disclosure
regarding the terms of those instruments and settlement alternatives.  SFAS No. 150 is generally effective for all
financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and is
otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning
after June 15, 2003.  We are currently
assessing the impact of SFAS No. 150 on our financial position and results of
operations.


Item 7A

.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is
the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices.  Our market risk exposures primarily include
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market
prices.  Our market risk sensitive instruments
are classified as “other than trading.” 
Our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual
results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and
losses that may occur, since actual gains and losses will differ from those
estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency
exchange rates and market prices and the timing of transactions.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to our investment portfolio. 
We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment
portfolio.  We manage our interest rate
risk by maintaining an investment portfolio consisting primarily of debt
instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average
maturities.  We also manage our interest
rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that
we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity.  As of March 31, 2003, our cash equivalents
and short-term investments included debt securities of $284.1 million.

The following table presents the amounts and related weighted average
interest rates of our investment portfolio as of March 31, 2003 (amounts in
thousands):

Our short-term
investments generally mature between three months and two years.

Foreign Currency
Exchange Rate Risk

We transact
business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial
market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
particularly GBP and EUR. The volatility of GBP and EUR (and all other
applicable currencies) will be monitored frequently throughout the coming
year.  When appropriate, we enter into
hedging transactions in order to mitigate our risk from foreign currency fluctuations.
We will continue to use hedging programs in the future and may use currency
forward contracts, currency options and/or other derivative financial
instruments commonly utilized to reduce financial market risks if it is
determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk.  We do not hold or purchase any foreign
currency contracts for trading purposes. 
As of March 31, 2003, we had no outstanding hedging contracts.

Market Price Risk

With regard to the structured stock repurchase transactions described
in Note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8, it is possible that at settlement we could take delivery of shares at
an effective repurchase price higher than the then market price.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Activision, Inc. (“Activision” or “we”) is a
leading international publisher of interactive entertainment software
products.  We have built a company with
a diverse portfolio of products that spans a wide range of categories and
target markets and that is used on a variety of game hardware platforms and
operating systems.  We have created,
licensed and acquired a group of highly recognizable brands which we market to
a growing variety of consumer demographics.

Our products cover game categories such as
action/adventure, action sports, racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person
action and strategy game categories.  We
currently offer our products in versions that operate on the Sony PlayStation 2
(“PS2”), Sony PlayStation (“PS1”), Nintendo GameCube (“GameCube”) and Microsoft
Xbox (“Xbox”) console systems, Nintendo Game Boy Advance (“GBA”) hand-held
device and the personal computer (“PC”). 
Our target audiences range from game enthusiasts and children to
mass-market consumers and “value” buyers.

Our publishing business involves the
development, marketing and sale of products, either directly, by license or
through our affiliate label program with third-party publishers.  Our distribution business consists of
operations in Europe that provide logistical and sales services to third-party
publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations
and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

We maintain operations in the U.S., Canada,
the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Australia, Sweden and the
Netherlands.  In fiscal year 2003,
international operations contributed approximately 50% of net revenues.

Principles of
Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Activision, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash, Cash
Equivalents and Short-term Investments

Cash and cash equivalents include cash, money
markets and short-term investments with original maturities of not more than 90
days.

Short-term
investments generally mature between three months and two years.  Investments with maturities beyond one year
may be classified as short-term based on their liquid nature and because such
securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current
operations.  All of our short-term
investments are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair market
value with unrealized appreciation (depreciation) reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity.  The specific identification method is used
to determine the cost of securities disposed with realized gains and losses
reflected in investment income, net.

Concentration of
Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially
subject us to concentration of credit risk consist principally of temporary
cash investments and accounts receivable. 
We place our temporary cash investments with financial
institutions.  At various times during
the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, we had deposits in excess of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limit at these financial
institutions.

Our customer base includes retail outlets and
distributors, including mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores,
discount warehouses and office super-stores in the United States and countries
worldwide.  We perform ongoing credit
evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit
losses.  We generally do not require
collateral or other security from our customers.  As of and for the year ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we
had one customer that accounted for 16%, 14% and 10%, respectively, of

F-6

consolidated net revenues and 46%, 22% and
9%, respectively, of consolidated accounts receivable, net.    This customer was the same customer in all
periods and was a customer of both our publishing and distribution businesses
in fiscal 2003 and 2002 and a customer of solely our publishing business in
fiscal 2001.

Financial
Instruments

The estimated fair values of financial
instruments have been determined using available market information and
valuation methodologies described below. 
However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data
to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented
herein may not be indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current
market exchange. The use of different market assumptions or valuation
methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses
approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.  Short-term investments are carried at fair
value with fair values being estimated based on quoted market prices.

We account for derivative instruments in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and SFAS No.
138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities, an amendment of SFAS 133.” SFAS No. 133 and 138 require that all
derivatives, including foreign exchange contracts, be recognized in the balance
sheet at their fair value.

We utilize forward contracts in order to
reduce financial market risks. These instruments are used to hedge foreign
currency exposures of underlying assets, liabilities, or certain forecasted
foreign currency denominated transactions. Our accounting policies for these
instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as
hedging transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated
as cash flow hedges, are highly effective, and qualify as hedging instruments,
are recorded in other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged item is
recognized in earnings. Any ineffective portion of a derivative change in fair
value is immediately recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of
derivatives that do not qualify as hedging instruments are recorded in
earnings. The fair value of foreign currency contracts is estimated based on
the spot rate of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the
period.  As of March 31, 2003 and 2002,
we had no outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts.

Equity Investments

From time to time, we may make a capital
investment and hold a minority interest in a third-party developer in
connection with entertainment software products to be developed by such
developer for us.  We account for those
capital investments in which we have a 20% or greater ownership interest or
over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence using the
equity method.  For those investments in
which we hold less than a 20% ownership interest or over which we do not have
the ability to exercise significant influence, we account for our investment
using the cost method.

Software
Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses

Software
development costs include payments made to independent software developers
under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for internally
developed products.

We account for
software development costs in accordance with SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.”  Software development costs are capitalized
once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are
determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product
encompasses both technical design documentation and game design
documentation.  For products where
proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle.
Technological feasibility is evaluated on a product-by-product basis.  Prior to a product’s release, we expense, as
part of cost of sales – software royalties and amortization, capitalized costs
when we believe such amounts are not recoverable.  Capitalized costs for those products that are cancelled or
abandoned are charged to product development expense.  Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized
are charged immediately to product development expense.  We evaluate the future recoverability of
capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis. 
The recoverability of capitalized software development costs is
evaluated based on the

F-7

expected
performance of the specific products for which the costs relate.  The following criteria are used to evaluate
expected product performance: 
historical performance of comparable products using comparable
technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and estimated
performance of a sequel product based on the performance of the product on
which the sequel is based.

Commencing
upon product release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to
cost of sales – software royalties and amortization based on the ratio of
current revenues to total projected revenues, generally resulting in an
amortization period of six months or less.  
For products that have been released in prior periods, we evaluate the
future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.  The primary evaluation criterion is actual
title performance.

Intellectual
property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property
rights holders for use of their trademarks or copyrights in the development of
our products.  Depending upon the agreement
with the rights holder, we may obtain the rights to use acquired intellectual
property in multiple products over multiple years, or alternatively, for a
single product.

We evaluate
the future recoverability of capitalized intellectual property licenses on a
quarterly basis.  The recoverability of
capitalized intellectual property license costs is evaluated based on the
expected performance of the specific products in which the licensed trademark
or copyright is to be used.  As many of
our intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple
years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property
license costs based on certain qualitative factors such as the success of other
products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property,
whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series
based on the intellectual property and the rights holder’s continued promotion
and exploitation of the intellectual property. 
Prior to the related product’s release, we expense, as part of cost of
sales – intellectual property licenses, capitalized intellectual property costs
when we believe such amounts are not recoverable.  Capitalized intellectual property costs for those products that
are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense.   The following criteria are used to evaluate
expected product performance: 
historical performance of comparable products using comparable
technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and estimated
performance of a sequel product based on the performance of the product on
which the sequel is based.

Commencing upon the related product’s
release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost
of sales – intellectual property licenses based on the ratio of current
revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products
in which the licensed trademark or copyright will be utilized.  As intellectual property license contracts
may extend for multiple years, the amortization of capitalized intellectual
property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one
year.  For intellectual property
included in products that have been released, we evaluate the future
recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.  The primary evaluation criterion is actual
title performance.

As of March 31, 2003, capitalized software
development costs included $26.0 million of internally developed software costs
and $36.1 million of payments made to third-party software developers.  As of March 31, 2002, capitalized software
development costs included $16.0 million of internally developed software costs
and $23.5 million of payments made to third-party software developers.  Capitalized intellectual property licenses
were $45.8 million and $17.2 million as of March 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  Amortization and
write-offs of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property
licenses, combined, was $100.4 million, $62.5 million and $68.9 million for the
year ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  For the year ended March 31, 2003,
amortization and write-offs of capitalized software development costs and
intellectual property licenses included approximately $15.0 million recorded in
the fourth quarter as the result of the assessment of the recoverability of
capitalized development costs relating to certain projects and certain of our
investments in long-term licensing agreements.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market.

F-8

Property and
Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at
cost.  Depreciation and amortization are
provided using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated
useful lives or the lease term: 
buildings, 25 to 33 years; computer equipment, office furniture and
other equipment, 2 to 5 years; leasehold improvements, through the life of the lease.  When assets are retired or disposed of, the
cost and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed and any resultant gains
or losses are recognized in current operations.

Goodwill

Effective April 1, 2001, we adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles.”  SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting
and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and other intangible
assets.  Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is
deemed to have an indefinite useful life and should not be amortized but rather
tested at least annually for impairment. 
An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of
goodwill is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair
value.  In accordance with SFAS No. 142,
we have not amortized goodwill during the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002.

Revenue
Recognition

We recognize revenue from the sale of our
products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers.  We may permit product returns from, or grant
price protection to, our customers on unsold merchandise under certain
conditions.  Price protection, when
granted and applicable, allows customers a credit against amounts they owe us
with respect to merchandise unsold by them. 
With respect to license agreements that provide customers the right to
make multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenue is recognized
upon delivery of such copies. Per copy royalties on sales that exceed the
guarantee are recognized as earned.  In
addition, in order to recognize revenue for both product sales and licensing transactions,
persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection of the related
receivable must be probable.

Revenue from product sales is reflected after
deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection.  Management must make estimates of potential
future product returns and price protection related to current period product
revenue.  We estimate the amount of
future returns and price protection based upon historical experience, customer
inventory levels and changes in the demand and acceptance of our products by
the end consumer.

Sales incentives or other consideration given
by us to our customers is accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force (“EITF”) Issue 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products).”  In accordance with EITF Issue 01-9, sales
incentives and other consideration that are considered adjustments of the
selling price of our products, such as rebates and product placement fees, are
reflected as reductions of revenue. 
Sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred
by us for assets or services received, such as the appearance of our products
in a customer’s national circular ad, are reflected as sales and marketing
expenses.

Shipping and
Handling

Shipping and handling costs, which consist
primarily of packaging and transportation charges incurred to move finished
goods to customers, are included in cost of sales – product costs.

Advertising
Expenses

We expense advertising as incurred, except
for production costs associated with media advertising which are deferred and
charged to expense the first time the related ad is run.  Advertising expenses for the year ended
March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $60.0 million, $50.3 million
and $47.7 million, respectively, and are included in sales and marketing
expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Investment Income,
Net

Investment income, net is comprised of the
following, (amounts in thousands):

F-9

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes using SFAS No.
109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” 
Under SFAS No. 109, income taxes are accounted for under the asset and
liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled.  The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.

Foreign Currency
Translation

The functional currencies of our foreign
subsidiaries are their local currencies. 
All assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated
into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period, and
revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates during
the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity.

Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive income includes net income,
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on short-term investments, foreign
currency translation adjustments, and the effective portion of gains or losses
on cash flow hedges that are presented as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity.

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities or the disclosure of gain or
loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Earnings Per
Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for all periods. 
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding, increased by common stock equivalents.  Common stock equivalents are calculated using the treasury stock
method and represent incremental shares issuable upon exercise of our
outstanding options and warrants and, if applicable in the period, conversion
of our convertible debt.  However,
potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted
earnings per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be
anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded.

Stock-Based
Compensation and Pro Forma Information

Under SFAS No.
123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” compensation expense is recorded
for the issuance of stock options and other stock-based compensation based on
the fair value of the stock options and other stock-based compensation on the
date of grant or measurement date. 
Alternatively, SFAS No. 123 allows

F-10

companies to continue to account for the
issuance of stock options and other stock-based compensation in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees.”  Under APB No. 25,
compensation expense is recorded for the issuance of stock options and other
stock-based compensation based on the intrinsic value of the stock options and
other stock-based compensation on the date of grant or measurement date.  Under the intrinsic value method,
compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant or measurement date only
if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the stock option or
other stock-based compensation exercise price. 
At March 31, 2003, we had several stock-based employee compensation
plans, which are described more fully in Note 13. We account for those plans
under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25 and
related Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected
in net income for any years presented, as all options granted under those plans
had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table illustrates
the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee
compensation:

The fair value of options granted in the years ended March 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001 has been estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable.  In
addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions,
including the expected stock price volatility. 
Because our options have characteristics significantly different from
those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in the opinion of
management, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of our options. 
For options granted during fiscal 2003, the per share weighted average
fair value of options with exercise prices equal to market value on date of
grant was $6.56.   For options granted
during fiscal 2002, the per share weighted average fair value of options with
exercise prices equal to market value on date of grant was $4.57.  For options granted during fiscal 2001, the
per share weighted average fair value of options with exercise prices equal to
market value on date of grant and exercise prices greater than market value
were $1.39 and $0.59, respectively.  The
per share weighted

F-11

average estimated fair value of Employee Stock Purchase Plan shares
granted during the year ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $3.26, $2.94,
and $1.55, respectively.

The effects on pro forma disclosures of applying SFAS No. 123 are not
likely to be representative of the effects on pro forma disclosures of future
years.

Common stock warrants are granted to non-employees in connection with
the development of software and acquisition of licensing rights for
intellectual property.   In accordance
with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other
Than Employees for Acquiring or in Connection With Selling Goods or Services,”
the fair value of common stock warrants granted is determined as of the
measurement date and is capitalized, expensed and amortized consistent with our
policies relating to software development and intellectual property license
costs.

Related Parties

As of March 31, 2002, we had $3.1 million of loans due from
employees.  The loans bore interest at
6.75% and were primarily due from Activision executives.  There were no such loans outstanding as of
March 31, 2003.

In August 2001, we elected to our Board of Directors an individual who
is a partner in a law firm that has provided legal services to Activision for
more than ten years.   For the years
ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, the fees we paid to the law firm account for
less than 1% of the firm’s total revenues. 
The rates charged to us were at arm’s length, and we believe that the
fees are competitive with the fees charged by other law firms.

Recently Issued
Accounting Standards

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No.
123.”  SFAS No. 148 provides alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation.  It also requires disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation
and the effect of the method used on reported results.  SFAS No. 148 is effective for annual and
interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002.  We adopted SFAS 148 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.  As we elected not to change to the fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation, the
adoption of SFAS No. 148 did not have an impact upon our financial condition or
results of operations.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.”  SFAS No. 149 amends and
clarifies the accounting guidance on derivative instruments (including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) and hedging activities that
fall within the scope of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.”  SFAS No. 149
is effective for all contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003,
with certain exceptions, and for hedging relationships designated after June
30, 2003.  The guidance is to be applied
prospectively.  We are currently
assessing the impact of SFAS No. 149 on our financial position and results of
operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both
Liabilities and Equity.”  SFAS No. 150
changes the accounting guidance for certain financial instruments that, under
previous guidance, could be classified as equity or “mezzanine” equity by now
requiring those instruments to be classified as liabilities (or assets in some
circumstances) in the statement of financial position.  Further, SFAS No. 150 requires disclosure
regarding the terms of those instruments and settlement alternatives.  SFAS No. 150 is generally effective for all
financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and is
otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning
after June 15, 2003.  We are currently
assessing the impact of SFAS No. 150 on our financial position and results of
operations.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the current year’s presentation.  These reclassifications had no effect on net

Stock
Split

In April 2003, the Board of Directors approved a three-for-two split of
our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 50% stock
dividend.  The split is payable on June
6, 2003 to shareholders of record as of May 16, 2003.  The par value of our common stock will be maintained at the
pre-split amount of $.000001.   The

Acquisitions

During the three years ended March 31, 2003,
we separately completed the acquisition of five privately held interactive
software development companies.  We
accounted for these acquisitions in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations.”   SFAS No. 141 was issued
on July 20, 2001 and addresses financial accounting and reporting for business
combinations, requiring that the purchase method be used to account and report
for all business combinations.  These
acquisitions have further enabled us to implement our multi-platform
development strategy by bolstering our internal product development
capabilities for console systems and personal computers and strengthening our
position in the first-person action, action and action sports game categories.  A significant portion of the purchase price
for all of these acquisitions was assigned to goodwill as the primary asset we
acquired in each of the transactions was an assembled workforce with proven
technical and design talent with a history of high quality product creation.  Pro forma consolidated statements of
operations for these acquisitions are not shown, as they would not differ
materially from reported results.

well as an option to purchase the remaining 60% of outstanding capital
stock.   Gray Matter was the developer

Operations
by Reportable Segments and Geographic Area

Based upon our organizational structure, we operate two business
segments: (i) publishing of interactive entertainment software and (ii)
distribution of interactive entertainment software and hardware products.

Publishing refers to the development, marketing and sale of products,
either directly, by license or through our affiliate label program with
third-party publishers.  In the United
States, we primarily sell our products on a direct basis to mass-market
retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses and office
super-stores.  We conduct our
international publishing activities through offices in the United Kingdom,
Germany, France, Australia, Sweden, Canada and Japan.  Our products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis
and through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements and through our
wholly-owned distribution subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom, the
Netherlands and Germany.

Distribution refers to our operations in the United Kingdom, the
Netherlands and Germany that provide logistical and sales services to
third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own
publishing operations and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Resources are allocated to each of these segments using information on
their respective net revenues and operating profits before interest and taxes.

The accounting policies of these segments are the same as those
described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.  Transactions between segments are eliminated
in consolidation.

Revenues by platform were as follows (amounts in thousands):

A significant portion of our revenues is
derived from products based on a relatively small number of popular brands each
year.  In fiscal 2003, 38% of our
consolidated net revenues (52% of worldwide publishing net revenues) was
derived from two brands, one of which accounted for 20% and the other of which
accounted for 18% of consolidated net revenues (27% and 25%, respectively, of
worldwide publishing net revenues).  In
fiscal 2002, two brands accounted for 35% of our consolidated net revenues (50%
of worldwide publishing net revenues), one of which accounted for 31% and the
other of which accounted for 4% of consolidated net revenues (44% and 6%,
respectively, of worldwide publishing net revenues).  In fiscal 2001, two brands accounted for 37% of our consolidated
net revenues (49% of worldwide publishing net revenues), one of which accounted
for 29% and the other of which accounted for 8% of consolidated net revenues
(39% and 10%, respectively, of worldwide publishing net revenues).

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  The components of the net deferred tax asset
and liability are as follows (amounts in thousands):

In accordance with Statement of Position (“SOP”) 90-7, “Financial
Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code,” issued by
the AICPA, benefits from loss carryforwards arising prior to our reorganization
are recorded as additional paid-in capital. 
During the year ended March 31, 2001, $3.7 million was recorded as
additional paid-in capital.

F-23

The tax benefits associated with certain net operating loss carryovers
relate to employee stock options.  A
valuation allowance of $12.7 million relates to these items and will be
credited to additional paid-in capital when realized.  Additionally, $3.8 million of related valuation allowance was
released and credited to additional paid-in capital during the year ended March
31, 2003.

As of March 31, 2003, our available federal net operating loss
carryforward of $117.2 million is subject to certain limitations as defined
under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The net operating loss carryforwards expire between 2007 and
2023.  We have various state net
operating loss carryforwards which are not subject to limitations under Section
382 of the Internal Revenue Code.  We
have tax credit carryforwards of $15.9 million and $9.9 million for federal and
state purposes, respectively, which begin to expire in 2006.

At March 31, 2003, our deferred income tax asset for tax credit
carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards was reduced by a valuation
allowance of $27.6 million as compared to $30.5 million in the prior fiscal
year.  Realization of the deferred tax
assets is dependent upon the continued generation of sufficient taxable income
prior to expiration of tax credits and loss carryforwards.  Although realization is not assured, management
believes it is more likely than not that the net carrying value of the deferred
tax asset will be realized.

Cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no
deferred taxes have been provided approximated $43.7 million at March 31,
2003.  Deferred income taxes on these earnings
have not been provided as these amounts are considered to be permanent in
duration.

Long-Term
Debt

As of March 31, 2003 and 2002, long-term debt
and the current portion of long-term debt were comprised of mortgage notes
payable.

Credit Facilities

In June 1999, we obtained a $100.0 million
revolving credit facility and a $25.0 million term loan with a syndicate of
banks (the “U.S. Facility”).  The
revolving portion of the U.S. Facility provided us with the ability to borrow
up to $100.0 million, including issuing letters of credit up to $80.0 million,
on a revolving basis against eligible accounts receivable and inventory.  The term loan had a three-year term with
principal amortization on a straight-line quarterly basis beginning December
31, 1999, a borrowing rate based on the banks’ base rate (which was generally
equivalent to the published prime rate) plus 2% or LIBOR plus 3% and was to
expire June 2002.  The revolving portion
of the U.S. Facility had a borrowing rate based on the banks’ base rate plus
1.75% or LIBOR plus 2.75%.  In May 2001,
we accelerated our repayment of the outstanding balance under the term loan
portion of the U.S. Facility. In connection with the accelerated repayment, we
amended the U.S. Facility (the “Amended and Restated U.S. Facility”).  The Amended and Restated U.S. Facility
eliminated the term loan, reduced the revolver to $78.0 million and reduced the
interest rate to the banks’ base rate plus 1.25% or LIBOR plus 2.25%. The
Amended and Restated U.S. Facility required us to maintain specified financial
ratios related to net worth and fixed charges and was collateralized by
substantially all of our assets.  As of
March 31, 2002, there were no borrowings and $5.8 million letters of credit
outstanding against the revolving portion of the Amended and Restated U.S.
Facility.  The Amended and Restated U.S.
Facility expired in August 2002. Due to our improved financial position,
including significant cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances
and minimal debt, we did not seek additional bank financing upon the expiration
of the Amended and Restated U.S. Facility.

We have a revolving credit facility through
our CD Contact subsidiary in the Netherlands (the “Netherlands Facility”).   The Netherlands Facility permitted
revolving credit loans and letters of credit up to Euro (“EUR”) 1.5 million
($1.7 million) and EUR 4.5 million ($3.9 million) as of March 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively, based upon eligible accounts receivable balances, was due
on demand, bore interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus 1.25% and 1.50% as of
March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and was collateralized by the
subsidiary’s accounts receivable and inventory.  As of March 31, 2002, the Netherlands Facility was additionally
collateralized by a EUR 2.3 million ($2.0 million) guarantee made by our
Centresoft subsidiary through its bank facility.  As of March 31, 2003 and 2002, there were no borrowings or
letters of credit outstanding under the Netherlands Facility.  The Netherlands Facility was originally
scheduled to expire in August 2003.

F-24

However, due to the improved liquidity
position of the subsidiary, the Netherlands Facility was terminated on April 1,
2003 and additional bank financing was not sought.

We also have revolving credit facilities with
our CentreSoft subsidiary located in the United Kingdom (the “UK Facility”) and
our NBG subsidiary located in Germany (the “German Facility”).  The UK Facility provided Centresoft with the
ability to borrow up to Great British Pounds (“GBP”) 8.6 million ($13.5
million) and GBP 8.5 million ($12.1 million), including issuing letters of
credit, on a revolving basis as of March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Furthermore, under the UK Facility, Centresoft provided a EUR 2.3 ($2.0
million) guarantee which served as collateral for the Netherlands Facility as
of March 31, 2002. A EUR 1.0 million ($1.1 million) guarantee was similarly
provided under the UK Facility for the benefit of CD Contact relating to other
matters as of March 31, 2003.  The UK
Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.5% and LIBOR plus 2% as of March 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively, is collateralized by substantially all of the
assets of the subsidiary and expires in October 2003.  The UK Facility also contains various covenants that require the
subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios related to, among others,
fixed charges.  As of March 31, 2003 and
2002, we were in compliance with these covenants.  No borrowings were outstanding against the UK Facility as of
March 31, 2003 or 2002.  The German
Facility provided for revolving loans up to EUR 0.8 million ($0.8 million) and
EUR 2.5 million ($2.2 million) as of March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
bore interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus 2.5%, is collateralized by the
subsidiary’s accounts receivable, inventory and certain property and equipment
and expires June 2003.  No borrowings
were outstanding against the German Facility as of March 31, 2003 or 2002.

Mortgage Notes Payable

Mortgage notes payable were $2.8 million and
$3.3 million as of March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Mortgage notes payable relate to the land,
office and warehouse facilities of our German subsidiary as of March 31, 2003
and of our German and Netherlands subsidiaries as of March 31 2002.  The Netherlands subsidiary’s mortgage note
was repaid in full in fiscal 2003.  The
German mortgage note bears interest at 5.45%, is due in bi-annual installments
of EUR 73,900 ($79,700), is collateralized by the related assets and matures
December 2018.  Prior to repayment, the
Netherlands mortgage note bore interest at 5.35%, was payable in quarterly
installments of EUR 11,300 ($12,200) and was collateralized by the related
assets.

Private Placement of Convertible Subordinated Notes

In December 1997, we completed the private placement of $60.0 million
principal amount of 6¾% convertible subordinated notes due 2005 (the
“Notes”).  The Notes were convertible,
in whole or in part, at the option of the holder at any time after December 22,
1997 (the date of original issuance) and prior to the close of business on the
business day immediately preceding the maturity date, unless previously
redeemed or repurchased, into our common stock at a conversion price of $8.389
per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.  During the three months ended June 30, 2001,
we called for the redemption of the Notes. 
In connection with that call, holders converted to common stock
approximately $58.7 million aggregate principal amount of their Notes, net of
conversion costs.  The remaining Notes
were redeemed for cash.

Commitments
and Contingencies

Developer and Intellectual Property Contracts

In the normal course of business we enter into contractual arrangements
with third parties for the development of products, as well as for the rights
to intellectual property.  Under these
agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a developer, or
intellectual property holder, based upon contractual arrangements.  Assuming all contractual provisions are met,
the total future minimum contract commitment for contracts in place as of March
31, 2003 is approximately $138.1 million, which is scheduled to be paid as
follows (amounts in thousands):

Lease Obligations

We lease certain of our facilities under non-cancelable operating lease
agreements.  Total future minimum lease
commitments as of March 31, 2003 are as follows (amounts in thousands):

Facilities rent expense for the year ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001 was approximately $7.6 million, $5.3 million and $4.7 million,
respectively.

Legal Proceedings

We are party to routine claims and suits brought against us in the
ordinary course of business, including disputes arising over the ownership of
intellectual property rights and collection matters.  In the opinion of management, the outcome of such routine claims
will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity.

The exercise price for Awards issued under the 1991 Plan, 1998 Plan,
1999 Plan, 2001 Plan, 2002 Plan, 2002 Executive Plan, 2002 Studio Plan and 2003
Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) is determined at the discretion of the Board
of Directors (or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which
administers the Plans), and for ISOs, is not to be less than the fair market
value of our common stock at the date of grant, or in the case of non-qualified
options, must exceed or be equal to 85% of the fair market value of our common
stock at the date of grant.  Options
typically become exercisable in installments over a period not to exceed seven
years and must be exercised within 10 years of the date of grant.  However, certain options granted to
executives vest immediately. 
Historically, stock options have been granted with exercise prices equal
to or greater than the fair market value at the date of grant.

Other Employee Stock
Options

In connection with prior employment agreements between Activision and
Robert A. Kotick, Activision’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian
G. Kelly, Activision’s Co-Chairman, Mr. Kotick and Mr. Kelly were granted
options to purchase common stock.  The
Board of Directors approved the granting of these options.  Relating to such grants, as of March 31,
2003, 5,211,000 shares were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price
of $4.21, of which, 5,023,500 were exercisable with a weighted average exercise
price of  $4.27.

We additionally have approximately 486,000 options outstanding to
employees as of March 31, 2003, with a weighted average exercise price of
$9.28.  The Board of Directors approved
the granting of these options.  Such
options have terms similar to those options granted under the Plans.  Relating to these options outstanding,
295,500 are exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $9.28.

We also issue stock options in conjunction with acquisition transactions.  As of March 31, 2003, 9,000 options with a
weighted average exercise price of $4.45 were outstanding relating to options
issued in conjunction with acquisitions completed in fiscal 1999 and 1998.   The Board of Directors approved the
granting of these options.  None of
these shares were exercisable as of March 31, 2003.

Director Warrants

The Director Warrant Plan, which expired on December 19, 1996, provided
for the automatic granting of warrants (“Director Warrants”) to purchase 37,500
shares of common stock to each director of Activision who was not an officer or
employee of Activision or any of its subsidiaries. Director Warrants granted
under the Director Warrant Plan vested 25% on the first anniversary of the date
of grant, and 12.5% each six months thereafter.  The expiration of the Plan had no effect on the outstanding
Director Warrants. As of March 31, 2003, there were no shares of common stock
available for distribution nor were there any warrants outstanding under the
Director Warrant Plan.

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997, we issued warrants to
purchase 90,000 shares of our common stock, at exercise prices ranging from
$5.25 to $6.17 to two of our outside directors in connection with their
election to the Board.  Such warrants
have vesting terms identical to the Directors Warrants and expire within 10
years from the date of grant.  Relating
to such warrants, as of March 31, 2003, 45,000 shares with a weighted average
exercise price of $6.01 were outstanding and exercisable.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

We have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees (the
“Purchase Plan”).  Under the Purchase
Plan, shares of our common stock may be purchased at six-month intervals at 85%
of the lower of the fair market value on the first or last day of each
six-month period (the “Offering Period”). 
Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 10% of their
gross compensation during an Offering Period.

F-28

Employees purchased approximately 76,500 and 67,500 shares at a price
of $14.21 and $9.09 per share during the Purchase Plan’s offering periods ended
September 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and approximately 139,500 and 72,000
shares at a price of $8.36 and $9.49 per share during the Purchase Plan’s
offering periods ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  The Purchase Plan expired on March 31, 2003.

On July 22, 2002, the Board of Directors approved the 2002 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan for eligible domestic employees.  The shareholders of Activision subsequently approved the 2002
Employee Stock Purchase Plan on September 19, 2002.  Then, on February 11, 2003, the Board of Directors approved the
2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan For International Employees. The primary
terms of the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the 2002 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan For International Employees (collectively the “2002 Purchase
Plans”) are the same.  Under the 2002
Purchase Plans, up to 750,000 shares of our common stock may be purchased by
eligible employees during two overlapping, twelve-month offering periods that
commence each April 1 and October 1 (the “2002 Offering Period”).  At any point in time, employees may participate
in only one 2002 Offering Period.  The
first day of each 2002 Offering Period is referred to as the “Offering
Date.”   Common stock is purchased by
2002 Purchase Plans participants at 85% of the lesser of fair market value on
the Offering Date for the 2002 Offering Period that includes the common stock
purchase date or the fair market value on the common stock purchase date.   Employees may purchase shares having a
value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during a 2002 Offering
Period, limited to a maximum of 7,500 common shares per common stock purchase
date.  As of March 31, 2003, no shares
had been issued under the 2002 Purchase Plans.

Activity of Employee and Director Options and
Warrants

Activity of all employee and director options and warrants during the
last three fiscal years was as follows (amounts in thousands, except weighted
average exercise price amounts):

For the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002,
all options were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value on
the date of grant.

For the year ended March 31, 2001, 9,769,500
options with a weighted average exercise price of $3.19 were granted at an
exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant and 5,457,000
options with a weighted average exercise price of $2.86 were granted at an
exercise price greater than fair market value on the date of grant.

F-29

The following tables summarize information
about all employee and director stock options and warrants outstanding as of
March 31, 2003 (share amounts in thousands):

Non-Employee Warrants

In prior years, we have granted stock warrants to third parties in connection
with the development of software and the acquisition of licensing rights for
intellectual property.  The warrants
generally vest upon grant and are exercisable over the term of the warrant.  The exercise price of third-party warrants
is generally greater than or equal to the fair market value of our common stock
at the date of grant.  During the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2003, we granted warrants to a third party to purchase
225,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $19.83 per share in
connection with, and as partial consideration for, a license agreement that
allows us to utilize intellectual property owned by the third party in
conjunction with an Activision product. The warrants vested upon grant and have
a three-year term. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the
Black-Scholes pricing model, assuming a risk-free rate of 4.18%, a volatility
factor of 70% and expected term as noted above. The per share weighted average
estimated fair value of the third-party warrants granted during the year ended
March 31, 2003 was $9.71 per share.  As
of March 31, 2003, 1,323,000 third-party warrants to purchase common stock were
outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $9.37 per share.   No non-employee warrants were granted
during the years ended March 31, 2002 or 2001. 
As of March 31, 2002, 1,165,000 third-party warrants to purchase common
stock were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $11.72 per
share.  As of March 31, 2001, 2,961,000
third-party warrants to purchase common stock were outstanding with a weighted
average exercise price of $4.84 per share.

In accordance with EITF 96-18, we measure the fair value of the
securities on the measurement date.  The
fair value of each warrant is capitalized and amortized to expense when the
related product is released and the related revenue is recognized.  Additionally, as more fully described in
Note 1, the recoverability of capitalized software development costs and
intellectual property licenses is evaluated on a quarterly basis with amounts
determined as not recoverable being charged to expense.  In connection with the evaluation of
capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses, any
capitalized amounts for related third-party warrants are additionally reviewed
for recoverability with amounts determined as not recoverable being amortized
to expense.  For the year ended March
31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, $3.6 million, $1.1 million and $1.4 million,
respectively, was amortized and included in cost of sales - software royalties
and amortization and/or cost of sales - intellectual property
licenses.

Employee Retirement Plan

We have a retirement plan covering substantially all of our eligible
employees.  The retirement plan is
qualified in accordance with Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Under the plan, employees may defer up to

F-30

15% of their pre-tax salary, but not more than statutory limits.  Effective January 1, 2003, we contribute 20%
of each dollar contributed by a participant. 
Prior to January 1, 2003, we contributed 5% of each dollar contributed
by a participant.  Our matching contributions
to the plan were approximately $320,000, $82,000, and $62,000 during the year
ended March 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

Capital
Transactions

Buyback Program

During fiscal 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a buyback program
under which we can repurchase up to $350.0 million of our common stock. Under
the program, shares may be purchased as determined by management, from time to
time, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including
privately negotiated structured option transactions and through transactions in
the options markets. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these
purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time
without prior notice.

As of
March 31, 2003, we had repurchased approximately 10.8 million shares of our
common stock at an average cost of $9.39 per share.  Additionally under the Board approved buyback program, we entered
into a series of structured stock repurchase transactions in the aggregate
amount of $110.0 million. These transactions may be settled in cash or stock
depending on the market price of our common stock on the date of the
settlement. Upon settlement, we will either have our capital investment
returned with a premium or receive up to approximately 12.8 million shares of
our common stock, depending, respectively, on whether the market price of our
common stock is above or below a pre-determined price agreed in connection with
each such transaction.  These
transactions are recorded in shareholders’ equity in the consolidated balance
sheet as of March 31, 2003.

Shareholders’ Rights Plan

On April 18, 2000, our Board of Directors approved a shareholders
rights plan (the “Rights Plan”).  Under
the Rights Plan, each common shareholder at the close of business on April 19,
2000, received a dividend of one right for each share of common stock
held.  Each right represents the right
to purchase one one-hundredths (1/100) of a share of our Series A Junior
Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $40.00.  Initially, the rights are represented by our common stock
certificates and are neither exercisable nor traded separately from our common
stock.  The rights will only become
exercisable if a person or group acquires 15% or more of the common stock of
Activision, or announces or commences a tender or exchange offer which would
result in the bidder’s beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock.

In the event that any person or group acquires 15% or more of our
outstanding common stock each holder of a right (other than such person or
members of such group) will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise
of such right, in lieu of shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock, the number
of shares of common stock of Activision having a value equal to two times the
then current exercise price of the right. 
If we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction
after a person has acquired 15% or more of our common stock, each holder of a
right will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such right a
number of the acquiring company’s common shares having a market value equal to
two times the then current exercise price of the right.  For persons who, as of the close of business
on April 18, 2000, beneficially own 15% or more of the common stock of
Activision, the Rights Plan “grandfathers” their current level of ownership, so
long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of certain
limitations.

We may redeem the rights for $.01 per right at any time until the first
public announcement of the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 15% of our
common stock.  At any time after a
person has acquired 15% or more (but before any person has acquired more than
50%) of our common stock, we may exchange all or part of the rights for shares
of common stock at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock per
right.  The rights expire on April 18,
2010.
