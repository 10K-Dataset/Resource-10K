INDEX


PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

(a)

General

Activision, Inc. (“Activision,” the “Company,”
or “we”) is a leading international publisher of interactive entertainment
software products. We have built a company with a diverse portfolio of products
that spans a wide range of categories and target markets and that is used on a
variety of game hardware platforms and operating systems. We have created,
licensed, and acquired a group of highly recognizable brands, which we market
to a variety of consumer demographics. Our fiscal 2006 product portfolio
included such best-selling products as

Call
of Duty 2, Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, Tony Hawk’s American Wasteland (“THAW”),
Madagascar, Ultimate Spider-Man, Quake IV, GUN, True Crime: New York City,

and

X-Men Legends II

.

Our products
cover diverse game categories including action/adventure, action sports,
racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person action, and strategy. Our target
customer base ranges from casual players to game enthusiasts, children to
adults, and mass-market consumers to “value” buyers. We currently offer our
products primarily in versions that operate on the Sony PlayStation 2 (“PS2”),
Nintendo GameCube (“GameCube”), Microsoft Xbox (“Xbox”), and Microsoft Xbox 360
(“Xbox360”) console systems, Nintendo Game Boy Advance (“GBA”), Sony
PlayStation Portable (“PSP”), and Nintendo Dual Screen (“NDS”) hand-held
devices, and the personal computer (“PC”). The installed base for this
current-generation of hardware platforms is significant and we anticipate the
fiscal 2006 release of the Xbox360 and the upcoming calendar 2006 releases of
the Sony PlayStation 3 (“PS3”) and the Nintendo Wii (“Wii”) will further expand
the software market over the next few years by expanding the installed base. We
successfully executed our strategy of having a high-quality product presence at
the launch of the Xbox360, releasing four titles concurrent with the console
launch, and are currently developing additional titles for the Xbox360. We are
currently developing three launch titles for the PS3,

Call of Duty
3, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance,

and

Tony Hawk’s
Project 8,

and three launch titles for the Wii,

Call of Duty
3, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance,

and

Tony Hawk’s
Downhill Jam.

Our plan is to have a significant presence at the
launch of both the PS3 and the Wii while marketing to current-generation
platforms as long as this remains economically attractive given their large
installed base.

Our publishing business involves the
development, marketing, and sale of products directly, by license, or through
our affiliate label program with certain third-party publishers. Our
distribution business consists of operations in Europe that provide logistical
and sales services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment
software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive
entertainment hardware.

We were originally incorporated in California
in 1979. In December 1992, we reincorporated in Delaware. In June 2000, we
reorganized into the current holding company organizational structure.

In April 2003, the Board of Directors approved a three-for-two split of
our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. The
split was paid on June 6, 2003 to shareholders of record as of May 16, 2003. In
February 2004, the Board of Directors approved a three-for-two split of our
outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. The
split was paid on March 15, 2004 to shareholders of record as of February 23,
2004. In February 2005, the Board of Directors approved a four-for-three split
of our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 33-1/3% stock
dividend. The split was paid March 22, 2005 to shareholders of record as of
March 7, 2005. In September 2005, the Board of Directors approved a
four-for-three split of our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a
33-1/3% stock dividend. The split was paid October 24, 2005 to shareholders of
record as of October 10, 2005. The par value of our common stock was maintained
at the pre-split amount of $.000001. All share and per share data have been
restated as if the stock splits had occurred as of the earliest period
presented.

(b)

Business
Combinations

We have completed a number of acquisitions of
both software development companies and interactive entertainment product
distribution companies. During fiscal 2006, we continued to enhance our
internal product development capabilities with the acquisition of two game
developers, Toys for Bob, Inc. and Beenox, Inc. Additionally, in May 2006, we
entered into an agreement to acquire video game publisher RedOctane Inc., the
publisher of the popular Guitar Hero franchise. See Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in


Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for additional information regarding the accounting treatment of
these and prior acquisitions.

(c)

Financial
Information About Industry Segments

We have two reportable segments: publishing
and distribution. Publishing relates to the development (both internally and
externally), marketing and sale of DVD, CD, UMD, online, and cartridge-based
interactive entertainment software products owned or controlled by us directly,
by license, or through our affiliate label program with certain third-party
publishers. Distribution primarily refers to logistical and sales services
provided by our European distribution subsidiaries to third-party publishers of
interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations and
manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware. See Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for certain financial information regarding reporting segment and
geographic areas required by Item 1.

(d)

Forward-Looking
Statements

In connection with the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Litigation Reform Act”), we are hereby disclosing
certain cautionary information to be used in connection with written materials
(including this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and oral statements made by or on
behalf of our employees and representatives that may contain “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the Litigation Reform Act. Such statements
consist of any statement other than a recitation of historical fact and can be
identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“estimate,” or “continue” or the negative thereof or other variations thereon
or comparable terminology. You are cautioned that all forward-looking
statements are necessarily speculative and there are numerous risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially
from those referred to in such forward-looking statements. These
forward-looking statements are subject to business and economic risk and
reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain and
difficult to predict. The discussion in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form
10-K highlights some of the more important risks identified by management, but
should not be assumed to be the only factors that could affect future
performance. You are cautioned that we do not have a policy of updating or
revising forward-looking statements, and thus you should not assume that
silence by the Company over time means that actual events are bearing out as
estimated in such forward-looking statements.

Narrative
Description of Business

Our objective is to be a worldwide leader in
the development, publishing, and distribution of quality interactive
entertainment software products that deliver a highly satisfying consumer
entertainment experience. Our business strategy, the key components of our
business operations, and the risk factors that could impact our business are
detailed below.

Strategy

Create, Acquire, and Maintain Strong Brands.

We
focus development and publishing activities principally on products that are,
or have the potential to become, franchise properties with sustainable consumer
appeal and brand recognition. It is our experience that these products can then
serve as the basis for sequels, prequels, and related new products that can be
released over an extended period of time. We believe that the publishing and
distribution of products based in large part on franchise properties enhances
predictability of revenues and the probability of high unit volume sales and
operating profits. We have entered into a series of strategic relationships
with the owners of intellectual property pursuant to which we have acquired the
rights to publish products based on franchises such as Marvel Comics’
properties, including Spider-Man and X-Men. We have a multi-year, multi-property, publishing agreement with
DreamWorks LLC that grants us the exclusive rights to publish video games based
on DreamWorks Animation SKG’s theatrical release “Shrek 2,” which was released
in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, “Shark Tale,” which was released in the
second quarter of fiscal 2005, “Madagascar,” which was released in the first
quarter of fiscal 2006, “Over the Hedge,” which was released in the first
quarter of fiscal 2007, and all of their respective forthcoming sequels,
including “Shrek the Third” and “Madagascar 2.”   As part of our agreement with DreamWorks
Animation SKG, we have the exclusive video game rights to potential future
films in the “Shrek” franchise beyond “Shrek the Third,” upcoming movies,
including “Bee Movie” and “Kung Fu Panda,” as well as other films currently in
development, including “Rex Havoc” and “How to Train Your Dragon.”  We have a strategic alliance with
Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. that grants us the exclusive, worldwide
interactive rights to develop and publish “World Series of Poker” video games
based on the popular World Series of Poker Tournament. We also have a strategic
relationship


with professional skateboarder
Tony Hawk through an exclusive multi-year agreement to develop video games
using his name and likeness. Through fiscal 2006, we have released seven
successful titles in the Tony Hawk franchise. We also have created a number of
successful internally developed intellectual properties such as the True Crime
and Call of Duty franchise properties, and

GUN

.
Recently we have also signed agreements with Hasbro Properties Group to develop
and publish video games based on the “Transformers” brand and with MGM
Interactive and EON Productions Ltd. to develop and publish video games based
on the James Bond license.

Execute Disciplined Product Selection and
Development Processes.

The success of our publishing
business depends, in significant part, on our ability to develop high quality
games that will generate high unit volume sales. Our publishing units have
implemented a formal control process for the selection, development,
production, and quality assurance of our products. We apply this process, which
we refer to as the “Greenlight Process,” to all of our products, whether
externally or internally developed. The Greenlight Process includes in-depth
reviews of each project at four important stages of development by a team that
includes many of our highest-ranking operating managers and coordination
between our sales and marketing personnel and development staff at each step in
the process.

We develop our products using a combination
of our internal development resources and external development resources acting
under contract with us. We typically select our external developers based on
their track record and expertise in producing products in the same category. One
developer will often produce the same game for multiple platforms and will
produce sequels to the original game. We believe that selecting and using
development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular
expertise of our internal and external development resources, which we believe
adds to the quality of our products.

Create and Maintain Diversity in Product Mix,
Platforms, and Markets.

We believe that maintaining a
diversified mix of products can reduce our operating risks and enhance
profitability. Therefore, we develop and publish products spanning a wide range
of product categories, including action/adventure, action sports, racing, role-playing,
simulation, first-person action, and strategy. We also develop products
designed for target audiences ranging from casual players to game enthusiasts,
children to adults, and mass-market consumers to “value” buyers. Presently, we
concentrate on developing, publishing, and distributing products that operate
on PS2, GameCube, Xbox, and the next-generation Xbox360 console systems, GBA,
PSP, and NDS hand-held devices, and the PC. We are developing products for the
PS3 and Wii next-generation console systems which are expected to be released
in calendar 2006. We typically offer our products for use on multiple platforms
in order to reduce the risks associated with any single platform, leverage our
costs over a larger installed hardware base, and increase unit sales.

Continue to Improve Profitability.

We
continually strive to manage risk and increase our operating leverage and
efficiency with the goal of increased profitability. We believe the key factor
affecting our future profitability will be the success rate of our product
releases. Therefore, our product selection and development process includes, as
a significant component, periodic evaluations of the expected commercial
success of products under development. Through this process, for titles that we
determine to be less promising, corrections are made in the development process
or, if necessary, they are discontinued before we incur additional development
costs. In addition, we believe our focus on cross platform releases and branded
products will contribute to improved profitability.

We continue to focus on increasing our
margins. We have, for example, acquired certain experienced and specialized
developers in instances where we can enhance profitability through the
elimination of royalty obligations. Additionally, we often rely on independent
third-party interactive entertainment software developers to develop some of
our software products, thereby taking advantage of specialized independent
developers without incurring the fixed overhead obligations associated with
increased internally employed staff.

Our sales and marketing staff work with our
studio resources to increase the visibility of new product launches and to
coordinate the timing and promotion of product releases. Our finance and sales
and marketing personnel work together to improve inventory management and
receivables collections. We have instituted broad, objective-based reward
programs that provide incentives to management and staff throughout the
organization to produce results that meet our financial objectives.

Grow Through Continued Strategic Acquisitions
and Alliances.

The interactive entertainment industry
has been consolidating, and we believe that success in this industry will be
driven in part by the ability to take advantage of scale. Specifically, smaller
companies are more capital constrained, enjoy less predictability of revenues
and cash flow, lack product diversity and must spread fixed costs over a
smaller revenue base. Several industry leaders are emerging that combine the
entrepreneurial and creative spirit of the industry with professional
management, the


ability to access the capital
markets, and the ability to maintain favorable relationships with developers,
intellectual property owners, and retailers. Through numerous completed
acquisitions since 1997, we believe that we have successfully diversified our
operations, our channels of distribution, our development talent pool, and our
library of titles, and have emerged as one of the industry’s leaders. We intend
to continue to evaluate the expansion of our resources through acquisitions,
strategic relationships, and key license transactions. We intend to continue
expanding our intellectual property library through key license transactions
and strategic relationships with intellectual property owners and to continue
to evaluate opportunities to increase our development capacity through the
acquisition of or investment in selected experienced software development firms.

Products

Historically, we have been best known for our
action/adventure, strategy, and simulation products. We have been successful in
the superheroes and skateboarding categories with our release of titles based
on the Spider-Man and X-Men properties, as well as the Tony Hawk franchise. We
have also been successful in the first person action categories through the
Call of Duty original intellectual property, which we plan on continuing as a
successful long-term franchise. We have established ourselves as a leader in
the “value” software publishing business with products under our Cabela’s,
Rapala’s, World Series of Poker, and Greg Hasting’s

Paintball licenses, as well as with products distributed on
behalf of our “value” affiliate label partners. Products published by us in
this category are generally developed by third parties, often under contract
with us, and are marketed under the Activision Value Publishing name. Value
software is typically less sophisticated and less complex, both in terms of the
development process and consumer gameplay.

Hardware Licenses.

Our
products currently are being developed or published primarily for PS2,
GameCube,   Xbox, and Xbox360 console
systems; GBA, PSP, and NDS hand-held devices; and PCs. We are also developing
products for the PS3 and Wii next-generation console systems expected to be
released in calendar 2006. In order to maintain general access to the console
systems and hand-held devices marketplace, we have maintained licenses for PS2,
GameCube, Xbox, and Xbox360 console systems and GBA, PSP, and NDS hand-held
devices with the owners of each such platform. Each license allows us to create
multiple products for the applicable platform, subject to certain approval
rights which are reserved by each licensor. Each license also requires that we
pay the licensor a per unit royalty for each unit manufactured. In contrast, we
are not required to obtain any license for the development and production of
products for PCs.

Intellectual Property Rights.

Many
of our current and planned releases are based on intellectual property and
other character or story rights licensed from third parties, as well as a
combination of characters, worlds, and concepts derived from our extensive
library of titles, and original characters and concepts owned and created by us.
When publishing products based on licensed intellectual property rights, we
generally seek to capitalize on the name recognition, marketing efforts, and
goodwill associated with the underlying property. For intellectual property
owned by Activision, we generally attempt to establish such properties as
sustainable, long-term game franchises.

In acquiring intellectual property rights
from third parties, we seek to obtain rights to publish titles across a variety
of platforms, to include the ability to produce multiple titles and to retain
rights over an extended period of time. In past years, we have been able to
enter into a series of long-term or multi-product agreements with owners of
various intellectual properties that are well known throughout the world and to
create products based on these recognizable characters, story lines, or
concepts. These agreements typically provide us with exclusive publishing
rights for a specific period of time and, in some cases, for specified platforms
and, in other cases, with renewal rights upon the satisfaction of certain
conditions. The scope of our licensing activities includes theatrical motion
pictures, television shows, animated films and series, comic books, literary
works, sports personalities and events, and celebrities. We intend to continue
expanding relationships with our existing intellectual property partners and to
enter into agreements with other intellectual property owners for additional
recognizable properties, characters, story lines and concepts. However, we may
not be able to maintain or expand our existing relationships or to seek out and
sustain new long-term relationships of similar caliber in the future.

Product
Development and Support

We develop and produce titles using a model
in which a core group of creative, production, and technical professionals, in
coordination with our marketing and finance departments, have responsibility
for the entire development and production process including the supervision and
coordination of internal and external resources. This team assembles the
necessary creative elements to complete a title using, where appropriate,
outside programmers, artists, animators, scriptwriters, musicians and
songwriters, sound effects and special effects experts,


and sound and video studios. We
believe that this model allows us to supplement internal expertise with top
quality external resources on an as-needed basis.

In addition, we often seek out and engage
independent third-party developers to create products on our behalf. Such
products are sometimes owned by us, and usually we have unlimited rights to
commercially exploit these products. In other circumstances, the third-party
developer may retain ownership of the intellectual property and/or technology
included in the product and reserve certain exploitation rights. We typically
select these independent third-party developers based on their expertise in
developing products in a specific category and use the same developer to
produce the same game for multiple platforms. Each of our third-party
developers is under contract with us for specific or multiple titles. From time
to time, we also acquire the license rights to publish and/or distribute software
products that are or will be independently created by third-party developers. In
such cases, the agreements with such developers provide us with exclusive
publishing and/or distribution rights for a specific period of time, often for
specified platforms and territories. In either case, we often have the ability
to publish and/or distribute sequels, conversions, enhancements, and add-ons to
the product initially being produced by the independent developer and
frequently have the right to engage the services of the original developer with
regard to the development of such products.

In consideration for the services that the
independent third-party developer provides, it receives a royalty generally
based on net sales of the product that it has developed. Typically, the
developer also receives an advance, which we recoup from the royalties
otherwise payable to the developer. The advance generally is paid in “milestone”
stages. The payment at each stage is tied to the completion and delivery of a
detailed performance milestone. Working with an independent developer allows us
to reduce our fixed development costs, share development risks with the
third-party developer, take advantage of the third-party developer’s expertise
in connection with certain categories of products or certain platforms, and
gain access to proprietary development technologies.

From time to time, we may make a capital
investment and hold a minority interest in a third-party developer in
connection with interactive entertainment software products to be developed by
such developer for us, which we believe helps to create a closer relationship
between us and the developer. We account for those capital investments over
which we have the ability to exercise significant influence using the equity
method. For those investments over which we do not have the ability to exercise
significant influence, we account for our investment using the cost method. There
can be no assurance that we will realize long-term benefits from such
investments or that we will continue to carry such investments at their current
value.

“Greenlight
Process”

We have adopted and implemented a rigorous
procedure for the selection, development, production, and quality assurance of
our internally and externally produced interactive entertainment software
titles. The process, known internally as the “Greenlight Process,” involves
four phases throughout the development and production phases of a title, each
of which includes a number of specific performance milestones. The four phases
of the “Greenlight Process” are the concept, prototype, first playable, and
alpha. This procedure is designed to enable us to manage and control production
and development budgets and timetables, to identify and address production and
technical issues at the earliest opportunity, and to coordinate marketing and
quality control strategies throughout the production and development phases,
all in an environment that fosters creativity. Checks and balances are intended
to be provided through the structured interaction of the project team with our
creative, technical, marketing, and quality assurance/customer support
personnel, as well as our legal, accounting, and finance departments. In order
to maintain the competitiveness of our products and to take advantage of
increasingly sophisticated technology associated with hardware platforms, our
development process includes a significant amount of time for play-testing new
products, and extensive product quality evaluations.

Product Support

We provide various forms of product support
to both our internally and externally developed titles. Our quality assurance
personnel are involved throughout the development and production of each title
published by us. We subject all such products to extensive testing before release
to ensure compatibility with all appropriate hardware systems and
configurations and to minimize the number of bugs and other defects found in
the products. To support our products after release, we provide online access
to our customers on a 24-hour basis as well as telephone operator help lines
during regular business hours. The customer support group tracks customer
inquiries and we use this data to help improve the development and production
processes.


Publishing
Activities

Marketing

Our marketing efforts include online
activities (such as the creation of World Wide Web pages to promote specific
titles), public relations, print and broadcast advertising, coordinated
in-store and industry promotions (including merchandising and point of purchase
displays), participation in cooperative advertising programs, direct response
vehicles, and product sampling through demonstration software distributed
through the Internet or on compact discs. From time to time, we also receive
marketing support from hardware manufacturers and retailers in connection with
their own promotional efforts. In addition, certain of our products contain
software that enables customers to “electronically register” their purchases
with us online.

We believe that certain of our franchise
properties have loyal and devoted audiences who purchase our sequels as a
result of dedication to the property and satisfaction from previous product
purchases. We therefore market these sequels both toward the established market
as well as broader audiences. In addition, in marketing titles based on
licensed properties, we believe that we derive benefits from the continued
exploitation of these licensed properties and the marketing and promotional
activities of the property owners.

Sales and
Distribution

North America.

Our
products are available for sale or rental in thousands of retail outlets
domestically. Our North American customers include Best Buy, Blockbuster,
Circuit City, GameStop, Target, Toys “R” Us, and Wal-Mart. Our largest
customers, Wal-Mart and GameStop, accounted for approximately 22% and 10% of consolidated net revenues for the year
ended March 31, 2006. For the year ended March 31, 2005, our largest customer,
Wal-Mart, accounted for 23% of consolidated net revenues.

In the United States and Canada, our products
are sold primarily on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer
electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game specialty stores. We believe
that a direct relationship with retail accounts results in more effective
inventory management, merchandising, and communications than would be possible
through indirect relationships. We have implemented electronic data interchange
linkages with many of our retailers to facilitate the placing and shipping of
orders. We sell our products to a limited number of distributors.

International.

Our
products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through
third-party distribution and licensing arrangements, and through our
wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries. We conduct our international
publishing activities through offices in the United Kingdom, Germany, France,
Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden, Australia, and Japan. Whenever
practicable, we seek to maximize our worldwide revenues and profits by
releasing high quality foreign language releases concurrently with English
language releases and by continuing to expand the number of direct selling
relationships we maintain with key retailers in major territories.

Affiliate Labels.

In
addition to our own products, we distribute a select number of interactive
entertainment products that are developed and marketed by other third-party
publishers through our “affiliate label” programs in North America, Europe, and
Australia. The distribution of other publishers’ products allows us to increase
the efficiencies of our sales force and provides us with the ability to better
ensure adequate shelf presence at retail stores for all of the products that we
distribute. Distributing other publishers’ titles mitigates the risk associated
with a particular title or titles published by us failing to achieve
expectations. Services provided by us under our affiliate label program include
order solicitation, in-store marketing, logistics and order fulfillment, sales
channel management, as well as other accounting and general administrative
functions. Our current affiliate label partners include LucasArts, as well as
several affiliate label partners in our “value” business. Each affiliate label
relationship is unique and may pertain only to distribution in certain
geographic territories such as the North America, Europe, or Australia and may
be further limited only to specific titles or titles for specific platforms.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain
financial information regarding reporting segments and geographic areas
required by Item 1.

Distribution

We distribute interactive entertainment
hardware and software products in Europe through our European distribution
subsidiaries: Centresoft in the United Kingdom; NBG in Germany; and CD Contact
in the Benelux


countries. These subsidiaries
act as wholesalers in the distribution of products and also provide packaging
and logistical and sales services. They provide services to our publishing
operations and to various third-party publishers, including Sony Computer
Entertainment (“Sony”), Nintendo Co. Ltd. (“Nintendo”), and Microsoft
Corporation (“Microsoft”). Centresoft is Sony’s exclusive distributor of
PlayStation products to the independent channel in the United Kingdom. In the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, sales for Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft
accounted for approximately 24%, 3%, and 3%, respectively, of our worldwide
distribution net revenues.

We entered into the distribution business to
obtain distribution capacity in Europe for our own products, while supporting
the distribution infrastructure with third-party sales, and to diversify our
operations into the European market. Centresoft and our other distribution
subsidiaries operate in accordance with strict confidentiality procedures in
order to provide independent services to various third-party publishers.

Emerging
Technologies

We are
actively supporting emerging platforms (wireless devices, digital downloads,
closed and open online networks, and interactive television) by publishing and
licensing key brands for these emerging platforms. We have published and
licensed rights to various brands, such as

Ultimate

Spider-Man, Tony Hawk’s American Wasteland,
Call of Duty 2, X-Men Legends II: Rise of the Apocalypse (“X-Men Legends II”),

and

Fantastic Four

for various hand-held
wireless devices, such as Nokia’s N-Gage wireless platform, as well as many
traditional wireless handsets. We also develop and optimize many of our titles
for consoles that support online play, such as PS2, Xbox Live on both the Xbox
and Xbox360, and the up-coming Sony PS3 and Nintendo Wii next-generation
consoles. We believe that more of our brands can be successfully published for
wireless and online platforms, as well as exploited through other emerging
technologies, as they continue to evolve.

Manufacturing

We prepare a set of master program copies,
documentation, and packaging materials for our products for each hardware
platform on which the product will be released. Except with respect to products
for use on the Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft systems, our disk duplication,
packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly, and shipping are
performed by third-party subcontractors.

To maintain protection over their hardware
technologies, Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft generally specify or control the manufacturing
and assembly of finished products. We deliver the master materials to the
licensor or its approved replicator, which then manufactures finished goods and
delivers them to us for distribution under our label. At the time our product
unit orders are filled by the manufacturer, we become responsible for the costs
of manufacturing and the applicable per unit royalty on such units, even if the
units do not ultimately sell.

To date, we have not experienced any material
difficulties or delays in the manufacture and assembly of our products or
material returns due to product defects.

Competition

The interactive entertainment software
industry is intensely competitive and new interactive entertainment software
products and platforms are regularly introduced. Our competitors vary in size
from small companies with limited resources to very large corporations with
significantly greater financial, marketing, and product development resources
than we have. Due to their greater resources, certain of our competitors can
spend more money and time on developing and testing products, undertake more
extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, pay
higher fees to licensors for desirable motion picture, television, sports and
character properties, and pay more to third-party software developers than we
can. In addition, competitors with larger product lines and popular titles
typically have greater leverage with retailers, distributors, and other
customers who may be willing to promote titles with less consumer appeal in
return for access to such competitor’s most popular titles. We believe that the
main competitive factors in the interactive entertainment software industry
include: product features and playability; brand name recognition; compatibility
of products with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; quality of
products; ease of use; price; marketing support; and quality of customer
service.

We compete primarily with other publishers of
personal computer and video game console interactive entertainment software. Significant
third-party software competitors currently include, among others: Atari, Inc.;
Capcom Co. Ltd.; Eidos PLC; Electronic Arts Inc.; Konami Company Ltd.; Midway
Games Inc.; Namco Ltd.; Sega Enterprises, Ltd.; Take-Two Interactive Software,
Inc.; THQ Inc.; Ubi Soft Entertainment; and Vivendi Universal


Publishing. In addition,
integrated video game console hardware and software companies such as Sony,
Nintendo, and Microsoft compete directly with us in the development of software
titles for their respective platforms.

Employees

As of March 31, 2006, we had 2,149 employees,
including 1,370 in product development, 167 in North American publishing, 156
in international publishing, 150 in operations, corporate finance and
administration, and 306 in European distribution activities.

As of March 31, 2006, 292 of our full-time
employees were subject to term employment agreements with us. These agreements
generally commit such employees to employment terms of between one and five
years from the commencement of their respective agreements. Most of the
employees subject to such agreements are executive officers or key members of
the product development, sales, or marketing divisions. These individuals
perform services for us as executives, directors, producers, associate
producers, computer programmers, game designers, sales directors, and marketing
product managers. The execution by us of employment agreements with such
employees, in our experience, reduces our turnover during the development,
production, and distribution phases of our entertainment software products and
allows us to plan more effectively for future development and marketing
activities.

None of our employees are subject to a
collective bargaining agreement except for the employees of our German
distribution subsidiary who are allowed by German law to belong to an organized
labor council. To date, we have not experienced any labor-related work
stoppages.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our business is subject
to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial
performance. If any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our
business and financial performance could be harmed, our actual results could
differ materially from our expectations, and the market value of our securities
could decline.

We depend on a relatively small
number of brands for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.

A significant portion of our revenues is
derived from products based on a relatively small number of popular brands each
year, and these products are responsible for a disproportionate amount of our
profits. In addition, many of these products have substantial production or
acquisition costs and marketing budgets. In fiscal 2006, 30% of our
consolidated net revenues (38% of worldwide publishing net revenues) was
derived from three brands, which accounted for 14%, 8%, and 8% of consolidated
net revenues (18%, 10%, and 10% of worldwide publishing net revenues). In
fiscal 2005, 37% of our consolidated net revenues (48% of worldwide publishing
net revenues) was derived from three brands, which accounted for 16%, 11%, and
10% of consolidated net revenues (21%, 14%, and 13% of worldwide publishing net
revenues). In fiscal 2004, 35% of our consolidated net revenues (49% of
worldwide publishing net revenues) was derived from three brands, which
accounted for 17%, 14%, and 4% of consolidated net revenues (24%, 20%, and 5%
of worldwide publishing net revenues). We expect that a limited number of
popular brands will continue to produce a disproportionately large amount of
our revenues and profits. Due to this dependence on a limited number of brands,
the failure to achieve anticipated results by one or more products based on
these brands may significantly harm our business and financial results.

Our future success depends on our
ability to release popular products.

The life of any one game product is
relatively short, in many cases less than one year.

The life cycle of a title generally
involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after
introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales. Because revenues associated
with an initial product launch generally constitute a high percentage of the
total revenues associated with the life of a product, delays in product
releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new
products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and
cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations.

It
is therefore important for us to be able to continue to develop many high
quality new products that are popularly received. We focus our development and
publishing activities principally on products that are, or have the potential
to become, franchise brand properties. If we are unable to do this, our
business and financial results may be negatively affected.


If we are unable to maintain or
acquire licenses to intellectual property, we may publish fewer “hit” titles
and our revenue may decline.

Many of our products are based on
intellectual property and other character or story rights acquired or licensed
from third parties. These license and distribution agreements are limited in
scope and time, and we may not be able to renew key licenses when they expire
or to include new products in existing licenses. The loss of a significant
number of our intellectual property licenses or of our relationships with
licensors, or inability to obtain additional licenses of significant commercial
value could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop new
products and therefore on our business and financial results. Additionally, the
failure of intellectual property acquired by us to be popularly received could
impact the market acceptance of our products in which the intellectual property
is included. Such lack of market acceptance could result in the write-off of
the unrecovered portion of acquired intellectual property assets, which could
cause material harm to our business and financial results. Furthermore, the
competition for these licenses and distribution agreements is often intense. Competition
for these licenses may also drive up the advances, guarantees, and royalties
that we must pay to the licensor, which could increase our costs.

Transitions in console platforms
could have a material impact on the market for interactive entertainment
software.

When new console platforms are announced or
introduced into the market, consumers typically reduce their purchases of game
console entertainment software products for current console platforms in
anticipation of new platforms becoming available. During these periods, sales
of our game console entertainment software products may be expected to slow or
even decline until new platforms are introduced and achieve wide consumer
acceptance.

This decline may
not be offset by increased sales of products for the new console platforms. In
fiscal 2006, Microsoft released Xbox360 and in calendar 2006, Sony and Nintendo
plan to introduce their respective next-generation hardware platforms, the
Playstation 3 and Wii, respectively.

We began selling games for
the

Xbox360

concurrently
with

its launch

and are

developing

titles for the next-generation console systems being developed by Sony

and Nintendo.

Delays
in the launch, shortages, technical problems, or lack of consumer acceptance of
the next-generation platforms could adversely affect our sales of products for
these platforms. In addition, as console hardware moves through its life cycle,
hardware manufacturers typically enact price reductions and decreasing prices
may put downward pressure on our software prices.

We must make significant
expenditures to develop products for new platforms which may not be successful
or released when anticipated.

We must make substantial product development
and other investments in a particular platform well in advance of introduction
of the platform and we may be required to realign our product portfolio and
development efforts in response to market changes.

Furthermore, development costs for
new console platforms are greater than current console platforms. If increased
costs are not offset by higher revenues and other cost efficiencies, our
operating results will suffer and our financial position will be harmed.

If
the platforms for which we develop new software products or modify existing
products are not released on a timely basis or do not attain significant market
penetration, or if we develop products for a delayed or unsuccessful platform
or cancel development of products in response to market changes, we may not be
able to recover in revenues our development costs, which could be significant,
and our business and financial results could be significantly harmed.

In addition,
we seek to release many of our products in conjunction with specific events,
such as the release of a related movie. If we miss these key selling periods,
due to product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we
have developed products, our sales will suffer disproportionately.

We are exposed to seasonality in
the sale of our products.

The interactive entertainment software
industry is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand
occurring during the year end holiday buying season. As a result, our net
revenues, gross profits, and operating income have historically been highest
during the second half of the calendar year. Additionally, in a platform
transition period, sales of game console software products can be significantly
affected by the timeliness of introduction of game console platforms by the
manufacturers of those platforms, such as Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft. The
timing of hardware platform introduction is also often tied to holidays and is
not within our control. If a hardware platform is released unexpectedly close
to the holidays, this would result in a shortened holiday buying season and
could negatively impact the sales of our products. Further, delays in development,
licensor approvals, or manufacturing can also affect the timing of the release
of our products, causing us to miss key selling periods such as the year end
holiday buying season.


If the average price of
current-generation titles continues to decline or if we are unable to sustain
launch pricing on next-generation titles, our operating results will suffer.

We have
experienced a decrease in the average price of our titles for
current-generation platforms. As the interactive entertainment industry
transitions to next-generation video game platforms, we expect there to be
fewer current-generation titles able to command premium price points, and we
expect that even these titles will be subject to price reductions at an earlier
point in their sales cycle than we have seen in prior years. We expect the
average price of current-generation titles to continue to decline, which may
have a negative effect on our margins and operating results.

With the
launch of the Xbox360 we have priced our next-generation titles at a premium
retail price of $59.99. We also plan to offer our next-generation titles for
the PS3 at the same premium pricing. We expect to continue to price
next-generation titles at premium pricing, but if we are unable to sustain
launch pricing on these next-generation titles we may experience a negative
effect on our margins and operating results.

If we do not continue to attract and
retain key personnel, we will be unable to effectively conduct our business.

Our success depends to a significant extent
on our ability to identify, hire, and retain skilled personnel. The software
industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive
recruiting among competitors for personnel with technical, marketing, sales,
product development, and management skills. We may not be able to attract and
retain skilled personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do so. If
we are unable to attract additional qualified employees or retain the services
of key personnel, our business and financial results could be negatively
impacted.

Our
platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the
manufacturing of and have broad approval rights over our video game products.

Generally, when we develop interactive
entertainment software products for hardware platforms offered by Sony,
Nintendo, or Microsoft, the products are manufactured exclusively by that
hardware manufacturer or their approved replicator.

Our agreements with these manufacturers
include certain provisions, such as approval rights over all products and
related promotional materials and the ability to change the fee they charge for
the manufacturing of products, that allow them substantial influence over our costs
and the release schedule of our products. In addition, since each of the
manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware platforms and
manufactures products for all of its other licensees, a manufacturer may give
priority to its own products or those of our competitors in the event of
insufficient manufacturing capacity. Accordingly, Sony, Nintendo, or Microsoft
could cause unanticipated delays in the release of our products as well as
increases to our development, manufacturing, marketing, or distribution costs,
which could materially harm our business and financial results.

In addition, as online capabilities for video
game platforms emerge, our platform licensors will control our ability to
provide online game capabilities for our console platform products and will in
large part establish the financial terms on which these services are offered to
consumers. Currently, Microsoft provides online capabilities for the Xbox and
Xbox360 and Sony provides online capabilities for PS2 products.

We expect Sony will also provide
online capabilities for PS3 products.

In each case,
compatibility code and the consent of the licensor are required for us to
include online capabilities in our products. In addition, the business model
for Microsoft’s and Sony’s online businesses for their video game products may
compete with our online business. As these capabilities become more
significant, the failure or refusal of our licensors to approve our products,
or the successful deployment by these licensors of services competitive to
ours, may harm our business.

Our
platform licensors set the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to
publish games for their platforms, and therefore have significant influence on
our costs.

We pay a licensing fee to the hardware
manufacturer for each copy of a product manufactured for that manufacturer’s
game platform. Starting in fiscal 2005 and continuing into fiscal 2007, our
platform licensors have begun to introduce new hardware platforms into the
market. In order to publish products for new hardware platforms, we must take a
license from the platform licensor which gives the platform licensor the
opportunity to set the fee structure that we must pay in order to publish games
for that platform. Similarly, the platform licensors have retained the
flexibility to change their fee structures for online gameplay and features for
their consoles and the manufacturing of products. The control that platform
licensors have over the fee structures for their future platforms and online


access makes it difficult for
us to predict our costs and profitability in the medium to long term. It is
also possible that platform licensors will not renew our licenses. Because
publishing products for console systems is the largest portion of our business,
any increase in fee structures or nonrenewal of licenses would have a
significant negative impact on our business model and profitability.

If our products contain defects,
our business could be harmed significantly.

Software products as complex as the ones we
publish may contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new
versions are released. Despite extensive testing prior to release, we cannot be
certain that errors will not be found in new products or releases after
shipment, that could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance. This loss
or delay could significantly harm our business, financial results, and
reputation.

We may permit our customers to return our
products and to receive pricing concessions which could reduce our net revenues
and results of operations.

We are exposed to the risk of
product returns and price protection with respect to our distributors and
retailers. Return policies allow distributors and retailers to return
defective, shelf-worn, and damaged products in accordance with terms granted. Price
protection, when granted and applicable, allows customers a credit against
amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them. We may permit
product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain
conditions. The conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to
return products or price protection are, among other things, compliance with
applicable payment terms, delivery to us of weekly inventory and sell-through
reports, and consistent participation in the launches of our premium title
releases. We may also consider other factors, including the facilitation of
slow-moving inventory and other market factors. When we offer price protection,
we offer it with respect to a particular product to all of our retail
customers; however, only those customers who meet the conditions detailed above
can avail themselves of such price protection. We also offer a 90-day limited
warranty to our end users that our products will be free from manufacturing
defects. Although we maintain a reserve for returns and price protection, and
although we may place limits on product returns and price protection, we could
be forced to accept substantial product returns and provide substantial price
protection to maintain our relationships with retailers and our access to
distribution channels. Product returns and price protection that exceed our
reserves could significantly harm our business and financial results.

Inadequate intellectual property
protections could prevent us from enforcing or defending our proprietary
technology.

We regard our software as proprietary and
rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, employee
and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and other methods to protect our
proprietary rights. We own or license various copyrights and trademarks. We are
aware that some unauthorized copying occurs within the computer software
industry, and if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our
interactive entertainment software products were to occur, it could cause
material harm to our business and financial results.

Policing unauthorized use of our products is
difficult, and software piracy is a persistent problem, especially in some
international markets. Further, the laws of some countries where our products
are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual
property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or are
poorly enforced. Legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in such
countries.

In addition, though
we take steps to make the unauthorized copying and distribution of our products
more difficult, as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our games are
played, neither our efforts nor those of the console manufacturers may be
successful in controlling the piracy of our products. This could have a
negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future.

Moreover, as we leverage our software
products using emerging technologies such as the Internet and online services,
our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing
intellectual property rights of others may diminish. We cannot be certain that
existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our
products in connection with these emerging technologies.

We may be subject to intellectual
property claims.

As the number of interactive entertainment
software products increases and the features and content of these products
continue to overlap, software developers increasingly may become subject to
infringement claims. Many of our products are highly realistic and feature
materials that are based on real world examples, which may inadvertently
infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Our products often
utilize complex, cutting edge technology that may become subject to the
intellectual property rights of others. Although we believe that we make
reasonable


efforts to ensure that our
products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others, it is
possible that third parties still may claim infringement. From time to time, we
receive communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or
future infringement claims against us, whether valid or not, may be time
consuming and expensive to defend.

Intellectual property litigation or claims
could force us to do one or more of the following:

•

Cease
selling, incorporating, or using products or services that incorporate the
challenged intellectual property;

•

Obtain
a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which if
available at all, may not be available on commercially favorable terms; or

•

Redesign
the affected interactive entertainment software products, which could cause us
to incur additional costs, delay introduction and possibly reduce commercial
appeal of our products.

Any of these actions may cause material harm
to our business and financial results.

We rely on independent third
parties to develop some of our software products.

We rely on independent third-party
interactive entertainment software developers to develop some of our software
products. Since we depend on these developers, in the aggregate, we remain
subject to the following risks:

•

Continuing
strong demand for developers’ resources, combined with the recognition they
receive in connection with their work, may cause developers who worked for us
in the past either to work for our competitors in the future or to renegotiate
our agreements with them on terms less favorable for us;

•

Limited
financial resources and business expertise and inability to retain skilled
personnel may force developers out of business prior to completing our products
or require us to fund additional costs; and

•

Our
competitors may acquire the businesses of key developers or sign them to
exclusive development arrangements. In either case, we would not be able to
continue to engage such developers’ services for our products, except for those
that they are contractually obligated to complete for us.

Increased competition for skilled third-party
software developers also has compelled us to agree to make significant advance
payments on royalties to game developers. If the products subject to these
arrangements do not generate sufficient revenues to recover these royalty
advances, we would have to write-off unrecovered portions of these payments,
which could cause material harm to our business and financial results. Typically,
we pay developers a royalty based on a percentage of net revenues, less agreed
upon deductions, but in a few cases, we have agreed to pay developers fixed per
unit product royalties after royalty advances are fully recouped. To the extent
that sales prices of products on which we have agreed to pay a fixed per unit
royalty are marked down, our profitability could be adversely affected.

Our industry is highly competitive

and our competition may succeed in
narrowing our market share and reducing our sales

.

We compete
primarily with other publishers of personal computer and video game console
interactive entertainment software.

Our competitors
vary in size from small companies with limited resources to very large corporations
with significantly greater financial, marketing, and product development
resources than we have.

In
addition, integrated video game console hardware and software companies such as
Sony Computer Entertainment, Nintendo Co. Ltd., and Microsoft Corporation
compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their
respective platforms. Certain of these

competitors can spend more
money and time on developing and testing products, undertake more extensive
marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, pay higher fees to
licensors for desirable motion picture, television, sports and character
properties, and pay more to third-party software developers than we can.

We also compete with other forms of
entertainment and leisure activities. For example, we believe that the overall
growth in the use of the Internet and online services by consumers may pose a
competitive threat if customers and potential customers spend less of their
available time using interactive entertainment software and more using the


Internet and online services.

A number of software publishers who
compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing
online games for use by consumers over the Internet. Future increased consumer
acceptance and increases in the availability of online games or technological
advances in online game software or the Internet could result in a decline in
platform-based software and negatively impact sales of our products. Direct
sales of software over the Internet by competitors could materially adversely
affect our distribution business.

Competition in
our industry is intense and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge. While
many new products are regularly introduced, only a relatively small number of “hit”
titles account for a significant portion of net revenue. Hit products published
by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we
anticipate, which could cause our product sales to fall below our expectations.
If our competitors develop more successful products, offer competitive products
at lower price points, or if we do not continue to develop consistently
high-quality and well-received products, our revenue, margins, and
profitability will decline.

We may face difficulty obtaining
access to retail shelf space necessary to market and sell our products
effectively.

Retailers of our products typically have a
limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources, and there is intense
competition among consumer interactive entertainment software products for high
quality retail shelf space and promotional support from retailers. To the
extent that the number of products and platforms increases, competition for
shelf space may intensify and may require us to increase our marketing
expenditures. Retailers with limited shelf space typically devote the most and
highest quality shelf space to those products expected to be best sellers. We
cannot be certain that our new products will consistently achieve such “best
seller” status. Due to increased competition for limited shelf space, retailers
and distributors are in an increasingly better position to negotiate favorable
terms of sale, including price discounts, price protection, marketing and
display fees, and product return policies. Our products constitute a relatively
small percentage of any retailer’s sales volume. We cannot be certain that
retailers will continue to purchase our products or to provide our products
with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support on acceptable terms.
A prolonged failure in this regard may significantly harm our business and
financial results.

Our sales may decline
substantially without warning and in a brief period of time because we do not
have long-term contracts for the sale of our products.

In the United States and Canada, we primarily
sell our products on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer
electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game specialty stores. Our products
are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party
distribution and licensing arrangements and through our wholly-owned European
distribution subsidiaries. Our sales are made primarily on a purchase order
basis without long-term agreements or other forms of commitments. Our largest
customers, Wal-Mart and GameStop, accounted for approximately 22% and 10%

of consolidated net revenues for the year
ended March 31, 2006. For the year ended March 31, 2005, our largest customer,
Wal-Mart, accounted for 23% of consolidated net revenues. The loss of,
or significant reduction in sales to, any of our principal retail customers or
distributors could significantly harm our business and financial results.

We may be burdened with payment
defaults and uncollectible accounts if our distributors or retailers cannot
honor their credit arrangement with us.

Distributors and retailers in the interactive
entertainment software industry have from time to time experienced significant
fluctuations in their businesses and a number of them have failed. The
insolvency or business failure of any significant retailer or distributor of
our products could materially harm our business and financial results. We
typically make sales to most of our retailers and some distributors on
unsecured credit, with terms that vary depending upon the customer’s credit
history, solvency, credit limits, and sales history, as well as whether we can
obtain sufficient credit insurance. Although, as in the case with most of our
customers, we have insolvency risk insurance to protect against our customers’
bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation, this insurance contains a significant
deductible and a co-payment obligation, and the policy does not cover all
instances of non-payment. In addition, although we maintain a reserve for
uncollectible receivables, the reserve may not be sufficient in every
circumstance. As a result, a payment default by a significant customer could
significantly harm our business and financial results.


We may not be able to maintain our
distribution relationships with key vendors.

Our CD Contact, NBG, and Centresoft
subsidiaries distribute interactive entertainment software and hardware
products and provide related services in the Benelux countries, Germany, and
the United Kingdom, respectively, and via export in other European countries
for a variety of entertainment software publishers, many of which are our
competitors, and hardware manufacturers. These services are generally performed
under limited term contracts. Although we expect to use reasonable efforts to
retain these vendors, we may not be successful in this regard. The cancellation
or non-renewal of one or more of these contracts could significantly harm our
business and financial results. Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft products
accounted for approximately 24%, 3%, and 3%, respectively, of our worldwide
distribution net revenues for fiscal 2006.

Our international revenues may be
subject to regulatory requirements as well as currency fluctuations.

Our international revenues have accounted for
a significant portion of our total revenues. International sales and licensing
accounted for 52%, 50%, and 53% of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal
2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. We expect that international revenues will
continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues in the
future. International sales may be subject to unexpected regulatory
requirements, tariffs, and other barriers. Additionally, foreign sales that are
made in local currencies may fluctuate. We have and may continue to engage in
limited currency hedging activities. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may in
the future have a material negative impact on revenues from international sales
and licensing and thus our business and financial results.

We are subject to the rating of our content by the Entertainment
Software Rating Board. Failure to obtain our target ratings for our products
could negatively impact our sales.

The
Entertainment Software Rating Board, sometimes referred to as the ESRB,
requires game publishers to provide consumers with information relating to
graphic violence, profanity, or sexually explicit material contained in
software titles, and imposes significant penalties for noncompliance. Certain
countries have also established similar rating systems as prerequisites for
product sales in those countries. In some instances, we may be required to
modify our products to comply with the requirements of rating systems, which
could delay or disrupt the release of our products. Our software titles receive
a rating of “E” (age 6 and older), “E10+” (age 10 and older), “T” (age 13 and
over), or “M” (age 17 and over). Many of our titles have received an “M” rating.
None of our titles have received the “AO” rating (18 and over). We believe that
we comply with rating systems and properly display the ratings and content
descriptions received for our titles. If we are unable to obtain the ratings we
have targeted for our products as a result of changes in the ESRB’s ratings
standards or for other reasons, including the adoption of legislation in this
area, our business and prospects could be negatively affected.

The ESRB
requires publishers to conduct pertinent content audit certifications with
respect to certain top selling titles, the objective of which is to assess what
portion, if any, of the games on the market include undisclosed pertinent
content on the disc that undermines the accuracy of the ESRB rating. This self
audit procedure applies to certain current titles and may be applied to
additional titles in the future. We are currently conducting a self audit in
accordance with the ESRB’s requirements. It is possible that there may be
content in our games that could be determined to be pertinent content that
causes a change to our current ESRB rating. In such event, we may be required
to record a reserve for anticipated product returns and inventory obsolescence
which could expose us to additional litigation, administrative fines and
penalties, and other potential liabilities, and could adversely affect our
operating results.

Our business,
products, and distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key
territories of content, consumer piracy, and online delivery. If we do not
successfully respond to these regulations, our business may suffer.

Legislation is continually being introduced
that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution. For
example, privacy laws in the United States and Europe impose various
restrictions on our web sites. Those rules vary by territory although the
Internet recognizes no geographical boundaries. In addition, many foreign
countries have laws that permit governmental entities to censor the content and
advertising of interactive entertainment software. Other countries, such as
Germany, have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged goods and those
transmitted over the Internet that are stricter than current United States
laws.

Several
proposals have been made for federal legislation in the United States to
regulate our industry, including a bill, referred to as The Family
Entertainment Protection Act, which was recently introduced into the


Senate. Such bill proposes to prohibit the sale of “M” rated, “AO”
rated, and “Rating Pending” products to under-17 audiences. If the bill is
adopted into law, it may limit the potential market for our “M” rated products,
and adversely affect our operating results. We may also

be
required to modify our products or alter our marketing strategies to comply
with new regulations, which could delay the release of our products. Due to the
uncertainties regarding such regulations, confusion in the marketplace may
occur, and we are unable to predict what effect, if any, such regulations would
have on our business. In addition, a number of state legislative bodies in
states such as Illinois, California, New York, and Washington introduced
various forms of legislation designed to regulate and control sales of video
games deemed inappropriate for sales to minors. In the event such legislation
is adopted and enforced, the sales of our products in states with such laws may
be negatively affected.

Our products may be subject to legal
claims.

In prior fiscal years, two lawsuits,

Linda Sanders, et al. v. Meow Media, Inc., et al.

, United
States District Court for the District of Colorado, and

Joe James,
et al. v. Meow Media, Inc., et al.

, United States District Court for
the Western District of Kentucky, Paducah Division, have been filed against
numerous video game companies, including us, by the families of victims who
were shot and killed by teenage gunmen in attacks perpetrated at schools. These
lawsuits alleged that the video game companies manufactured and/or supplied
these teenagers with violent video games, teaching them how to use a gun and
causing them to act out in a violent manner. These lawsuits have been dismissed.
Similar additional lawsuits may be filed in the future. Although our general
liability insurance carrier agreed to defend us in such lawsuits in the past,
it is uncertain whether the insurance carrier would do so in the future, or if
it would cover all or any amounts which we might be liable for if such future lawsuits
are not decided in our favor. If such future lawsuits are filed and ultimately
decided against us and our insurance carrier does not cover the amounts we are
liable for, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and
financial results. Payment of significant claims by insurance carriers may make
such insurance coverage materially more expensive or unavailable in the future,
thereby exposing our business to additional risk.

We may face limitations on our
ability to find suitable acquisition opportunities or to integrate additional
acquired businesses.

We intend to pursue additional acquisitions
of companies, properties, and other assets that can be purchased or licensed on
acceptable terms and which we believe can be operated or exploited profitably. Some
of these transactions could be material in size and scope. Although we continue
to search for additional acquisition opportunities, we may not be successful in
identifying suitable acquisitions. As the interactive entertainment software industry
continues to consolidate, we face significant competition in seeking and
consummating acquisition opportunities. We may not be able to consummate
potential acquisitions or an acquisition may not enhance our business or may
decrease rather than increase our earnings. In the future, we may issue
additional shares of our common stock in connection with one or more
acquisitions, which may dilute our existing shareholders. Future acquisitions
could also divert substantial management time and result in short-term
reductions in earnings or special transaction or other charges. In addition, we
cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate the businesses
that we may acquire into our existing business. Our shareholders may not have
the opportunity to review, vote on, or evaluate future acquisitions.

From time to time, we may make a capital
investment and hold a minority interest in a third-party developer in
connection with interactive entertainment software products to be developed by
such developer for us, which we believe helps to create a closer relationship
between us and the developer. We account for those capital investments over
which we have the ability to exercise significant influence using the equity
method. For those investments over which we do not have the ability to exercise
significant influence, we account for our investment using the cost method. There
can be no assurance that we will realize long-term benefits from such
investments or that we will continue to carry such investments at their current
value.

We may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely
fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand.

A significant
portion of our selling and general and administrative expense is comprised of
personnel and facilities. In the event of a significant decline in revenues, we
may not be able to exit facilities, reduce personnel, or make other changes to
our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant
termination and exit costs. Management may not be able to implement such
actions in a timely manner, if at all, to offset an immediate shortfall in
revenues and profit.


Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities
could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

We are subject
to income taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Significant
judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes
and, in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and
calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are also
required to estimate what our taxes will be in the future. Although we believe
our tax estimates are reasonable, the estimate process is inherently uncertain,
and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities. Our effective tax rate
could be adversely affected by changes in our business, including the mix of
earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the
elections we make, changes in applicable tax laws as well as other factors. Further,
our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and
developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision. Should
our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates, our income tax provision and
net income could be materially affected.

We are also required to pay taxes other than income
taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, and goods
and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.
We are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these
non-income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these
examinations, changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will
not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

Our shareholder rights plan,
charter documents, and other agreements may make it more difficult to acquire
us without the approval of our Board of Directors.

We have adopted a shareholder rights plan under which one right
entitling the holder to purchase one six-hundredths (1/600) of a share, as
adjusted on account of stock dividends made since the plan’s adoption, of our
Series A Junior Preferred Stock price at an exercise price of $6.67 per share,
subject to adjustment and as adjusted on account of stock dividends made since
the plan’s adoption, is attached to each outstanding share of common stock. Such
shareholder rights plan makes an acquisition of control in a transaction not
approved by our Board of Directors more difficult. Our Amended and Restated
By-laws have advance notice provisions for nominations for election of nominees
to the Board of Directors which may make it more difficult to acquire control
of us. Our long-term incentive plans provide, in the discretion of a committee,
for acceleration of stock options following a change in control under certain
circumstances, which has the effect of making an acquisition of control more
expensive. In addition, some of our officers have severance compensation
agreements that provide for substantial cash payments and accelerations of
other benefits in the event of a change in control. These agreements and
arrangements may also inhibit a change in control.

Our stock price is highly
volatile.

The trading price of our common stock has
been and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many
factors, including:

•

Quarter
to quarter variations in results of operations;

•

Our
announcements of new products;

•

Our
competitors’ announcements of new products;

•

Our
product development or release schedule;

•

General
conditions in the computer, software, entertainment, media or electronics
industries, and in the economy;

•

Timing
of the introduction of new platforms and delays in the actual release of new
platforms;

•

Hardware
manufacturers’ announcements of price reductions in hardware platforms;

•

Consumer
spending trends;


•

Changes
in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts; and

•

Investor
perceptions and expectations regarding our products, plans and strategic
position, and those of our competitors and customers.

In addition, the public stock markets
experience extreme price and trading volume volatility, particularly in high
technology sectors of the market. This volatility has significantly affected
the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons often
unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad
market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

We seek to manage our business with a view to
achieving long-term results, and this could have a negative effect on
short-term trading.

We focus on
creation of shareholder value over time, and we intend to make decisions that
will be consistent with this long-term view. As a result, some of our
decisions, such as whether to make or discontinue operating investments, manage
our balance sheet and capital structure, or pursue or discontinue strategic
initiatives, may be in conflict with the objectives of short-term traders. Further,
this could adversely affect our quarterly or other short-term results of
operations.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

On March 5,
2004, a class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our current
and former officers and directors. The complaint, which asserts claims under
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on
allegations that our revenues and assets were overstated during the period
between February 1, 2001 and December 17, 2002, was filed in the United States
District Court, Central District of California by the Construction Industry,
and Carpenters Joint Pension Trust for Southern Nevada purporting to represent
a class of purchasers of Activision stock. Five additional purported class
actions were subsequently filed by Gianni Angeloni, Christopher Hinton, Stephen
Anish, the Alaska Electrical Pension Fund, and Joseph A. Romans asserting the
same claims. Consistent with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”),
the court appointed lead plaintiffs consolidating the six putative securities
class actions into a single case. In an Order dated May 16, 2005, the court
dismissed the consolidated complaint because the plaintiffs failed to satisfy
the heightened pleading standards of the PSLRA. The court did, however, give
the lead plaintiffs leave to file an amended consolidated complaint within 30


days of the order. Rather than
file a new complaint, the Plaintiff agreed to dismiss the entire case with
prejudice. The Order dismissing the action with prejudice was entered on June
17, 2005.

In addition,
on March 12, 2004, a shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned

Frank Capovilla, Derivatively on Behalf of
Activision, Inc. v. Robert Kotick, et al.

was filed, purportedly on
behalf of Activision, which in large measure asserts the identical claims set
forth in the federal class action lawsuit. That complaint was filed in
California Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles. On August 11,
2005, in light of the ruling dismissing with prejudice the complaint in the
earlier filed federal securities class action, plaintiffs in the shareholder
derivative action filed an amended complaint, dropping most of the causes of
action, and focusing only on the allegations of insider trading and breaches of
fiduciary duty that were based on the same claimed misrepresentations set forth
in the dismissed federal securities class action. On September 15, 2005,
Activision and the individual defendants filed separate demurrers to the
Derivative Action and a motion to strike plaintiff’s jury demand. Prior to the
hearing on the demurrers, the parties came to a resolution of the action and
agreed to a stipulation of settlement to be submitted to the court for
preliminary approval. No cash recovery is to be paid to the plaintiff pursuant
to the stipulation of settlement, which also stated that the Company vigorously
denied any assertion of wrongdoing or liability. In furtherance of the
settlement, the Company agreed to pay $200,000 in plaintiffs’ fees, to be
funded by the Company’s D&O insurance carrier. The settlement acknowledged
that, after the time the derivative action was filed, the Company implemented
certain enhancements to its corporate governance policies. Notice of Settlement
was mailed and emailed to shareholders as well as posted on the Company’s
website. No objections to settlement were received. At a hearing held on May
22, 2006, the Court approved the settlement and released and dismissed the
alleged claims.

In addition, we are party to other routine
claims and suits brought by us and against us in the ordinary course of
business, including disputes arising over the ownership of intellectual
property rights, contractual claims, employment relationships, and collection
matters. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel,
the outcome of such routine claims will not have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY,
  RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER

PURCHASES OF EQUITY
  SECURITIES

Our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq
National Market under the symbol “ATVI.”

The following table sets forth for the
periods indicated the high and low reported sale prices for our common stock. As
of May 31, 2006, there were approximately 2,650 holders of record of our common
stock.

On May 31,
2006, the last reported sales price of our common stock was $13.08.

Cash Dividends

We paid no cash dividends in our fiscal years
2006 or 2005 nor do we anticipate paying any cash dividends at any time in the
foreseeable future. We expect that earnings will be retained for the continued
growth and development of the business. Future dividends, if any, will depend
upon our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects,
and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.

Stock Splits

In April 2003, the Board of Directors approved a three-for-two split of
our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. The
split was paid on June 6, 2003 to shareholders of record as of May 16, 2003. In
February 2004, the Board of Directors approved a second three-for-two split of
our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. The
split was paid on March 15, 2004 to shareholders of record as of February 23,
2004. In February 2005, the Board of Directors approved a four-for-three split
of our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 33-1/3% stock
dividend. The split was paid on March 22, 2005 to shareholders of record as of
March 7, 2005. In September 2005, the Board of Directors approved a
four-for-three split of our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a
33-1/3% stock dividend. The split was paid October 24, 2005 to shareholders of
record as of October 10, 2005. The par value of our common stock was maintained
at the pre-split amount of $.000001. All share and per share data have been
restated as if the stock splits had occurred as of the earliest period
presented.

On March 7, 2005, in connection with our March 22, 2005 stock split,
all shares of common stock held as treasury stock were formally cancelled and
restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

Buyback Program

During fiscal 2003, our Board of Directors authorized
a buyback program under which we can repurchase up to $350.0 million of our
common stock. Under the program, shares may be purchased as determined by
management, from time to time and within certain guidelines, in the open market
or in privately negotiated transactions, including privately negotiated
structured stock repurchase transactions and through transactions in the
options markets. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these
purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time
without prior notice.


Under the buyback program, we did not repurchase any
shares of our common stock in the years ended March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005.
We repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares of our common stock for $12.4
million in the years ended March 31, 2004. In addition, approximately 3.1
million shares of common stock were acquired in the year ended March 31, 2004
as a result of the settlement of $10.0 million of structured stock repurchase
transactions entered into in fiscal 2003. As of March 31, 2006, we had no
outstanding structured stock repurchase transactions. Structured stock
repurchase transactions are settled in cash or stock based on the market price
of our common stock on the date of the settlement. Upon settlement, we either
have our capital investment returned with a premium or receive shares of our
common stock, depending, respectively, on whether the market price of our
common stock is above or below a pre-determined price agreed in connection with
each such transaction.

Shareholders’ Rights Plan

On April 18, 2000, our Board of Directors
approved a shareholders rights plan (the “Rights Plan”). Under the Rights Plan,
each common shareholder at the close of business on April 19, 2000 received a
dividend of one right for each share of common stock held. Each right
represents the right to purchase one six-hundredths (1/600) of a share, as
adjusted on account of stock dividends made since the plan’s adoption, of our
Series A Junior Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $6.67, as adjusted on
account of stock dividends made since the plan’s adoption. Initially, the
rights are represented by our common stock certificates and are neither
exercisable nor traded separately from our common stock. The rights will only
become exercisable if a person or group acquires 15% or more of the common
stock of Activision, or announces or commences a tender or exchange offer which
would result in the bidder’s beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common
stock.

In the event that any person or group
acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, each holder of a right
(other than such person or members of such group) will thereafter have the
right to receive upon exercise of such right, in lieu of shares of Series A
Junior Preferred Stock, the number of shares of common stock of Activision
having a value equal to two times the then current exercise price of the right.
If we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after
a person has acquired 15% or more of our common stock, each holder of a right
will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such right a number
of the acquiring company’s common shares having a market value equal to two
times the then current exercise price of the right. For persons who, as of the
close of business on April 18, 2000, beneficially own 15% or more of the common
stock of Activision, the Rights Plan “grandfathers” their current level of
ownership, so long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of
certain limitations.

We may redeem the rights for $.01 per right
at any time until the first public announcement of the acquisition of
beneficial ownership of 15% of our common stock. At any time after a person has
acquired 15% or more (but before any person has acquired more than 50%) of our
common stock, we may exchange all or part of the rights for shares of common
stock at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock per right. The rights
expire on April 18, 2010.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

Overview

Our Business

We are a leading international publisher of interactive entertainment
software products. We have built a company with a diverse portfolio of products
that spans a wide range of categories and target markets and that is used on a
variety of game hardware platforms and operating systems. We have created,
licensed, and acquired a group of highly recognizable brands, which we market
to a variety of consumer demographics. Our fiscal 2006 product portfolio
included such best-selling products as

Call
of Duty 2, Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, Tony Hawk’s American Wasteland (“THAW”),
Madagascar, Ultimate Spider-Man, Quake IV, GUN, True Crime: New York City,

and

X-Men Legends II

.

Our products cover diverse game categories including action/adventure,
action sports, racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person action, and
strategy. Our target customer base ranges from casual players to game
enthusiasts, children to adults, and mass-market consumers to “value” buyers. We
currently offer our products primarily in versions that operate on the PS2,
GameCube, Xbox, and Xbox360 console systems, GBA, PSP, and NDS hand-held
devices, and the PC. The installed base for this current-generation of hardware
platforms is significant and the fiscal 2006 release of the Xbox360 and the
upcoming calendar 2006 releases of the PS3 and Wii, will further expand the
software market. We successfully executed our strategy of having a high-quality
product presence at the launch of the Xbox360, releasing four titles concurrent
with the console launch, and are currently developing additional titles for the
Xbox360. We are also currently developing three launch titles for the PS3,

Call of Duty 3, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance,

and

Tony Hawk’s Project 8,

and three launch titles for the Wii,

Call of Duty 3, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance,

and

Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam.

Our plan is to have a significant
presence at the launch of both the PS3 and the Wii while marketing to
current-generation platforms as long as economically attractive given their
large installed base.

Our publishing business involves the development, marketing, and sale
of products directly, by license or through our affiliate label program with
certain third-party publishers. In the United States and Canada, we primarily
sell our products on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer
electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game specialty stores. We conduct
our international publishing activities through offices in the United Kingdom (“UK”),
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, Canada, and
Japan. Our products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis,
through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements and through our
wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries. Our distribution business
consists of operations located in the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany that
provide logistical and sales services to third-party publishers of interactive
entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of
interactive entertainment hardware.

Our profitability is directly affected by the
mix of revenues from our publishing and distribution businesses. Operating
margins realized from our publishing business are typically substantially
higher than margins realized from our distribution business. Operating margins
in our publishing business are affected by our ability to release highly
successful or “hit” titles. Though many of these titles have substantial
production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets, once a title recoups
these costs, incremental net revenues directly and positively impact our
operating margin. Operating margins in our distribution business are affected
by the mix of hardware and software sales, with software producing higher
margins than hardware.

Our Focus

With respect to future
game development, we will continue to focus on our “big propositions,” products
that are backed by strong brands and high quality development, for which we
will provide significant marketing support.

Our fiscal 2006 “big
proposition” releases included well-established brands, which were backed by
high-profile intellectual property and/or highly anticipated motion picture
releases. For example, we have a long-term relationship with Marvel Enterprises
through an exclusive licensing agreement. During the third quarter of fiscal
2006, we further extended our exclusive licensing agreement with Marvel Enterprises
by signing a multi-year extension to our current video game licensing agreement
for the Spider-Man and X-Men franchises through 2017. This agreement grants us
the exclusive rights to develop and publish video games based on Marvel’s comic
book franchises Spider-Man and X-Men. Through fiscal 2006, games based on the
Spider-Man and X-Men franchises have generated more than $785.7 million in net
revenue worldwide. Our fiscal 2006 release schedule included titles based
on Marvel’s Spider-Man, X-Men, and Fantastic 4, which was part of our
previous licensing agreement. In the first


quarter of fiscal 2006 we released the video game,

Fantastic 4,

just prior to the theatrical
release of “Fantastic 4.”  We also
released

Ultimate Spider-Man

and

X-Men Legends II: Rise of the Apocalypse (“X-Men Legends II”)

in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 in
North America and in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 internationally. In
fiscal 2007, under this agreement, we plan to release

X-Men: The Official Game

around the
theatrical release of “X-Men: The Last Stand” and

Marvel: Ultimate Alliance

. In addition, through our
licensing agreement with Spider-Man Merchandising, LP, we will be developing
and publishing video games based on Columbia Pictures/Marvel Enterprises, Inc.’s
upcoming feature film “Spider-Man 3,” which is expected to be released in May 2007.
In addition, during the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we signed an agreement
with Spider-Man Merchandising, LP to extend our exclusive worldwide publishing
rights to publish entertainment software products based on subsequent
Spider-Man movie sequels or new television series through 2017.

We also have an exclusive
licensing agreement with professional skateboarder Tony Hawk. The agreement
grants us exclusive rights to develop and publish video games through 2015
using Tony Hawk’s name and likeness. Through fiscal 2006, we have released
seven successful titles in the Tony Hawk franchise with cumulative net revenues
of $1.1 billion, including the most recent,

THAW

,
which was released in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. We will continue to
build on the Tony Hawk franchise in fiscal 2007 with the release of

Tony Hawk’s Project 8

and

Tony Hawk’s
Downhill Jam

.

We continue to develop a number of original intellectual properties
which are developed and owned by Activision. For example, in the third quarter
of fiscal 2006 we released

Call of Duty 2

on
the PC and Xbox360 and

Call of Duty 2: Big
Red One

, on the GameCube, PS2, and Xbox. According to NPD Funworld,

Call of Duty 2

was the top selling Xbox360
title of the year. These titles were the fourth and fifth releases based upon
this original intellectual property following two other PC titles,

Call of Duty

and

Call of Duty: United Offensive,

and one
other console title,

Call of Duty: Finest
Hour.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we also released

True Crime: New York City

, which was based
upon our fiscal 2004 original intellectual property

True Crime: Streets of LA,

and

GUN,

a new original intellectual property. According to NPD
Funworld, we have developed the number one new original intellectual property
title in each of the past three years which included

True Crime: Streets of LA

in calendar 2003,

Call of Duty: Finest Hour

in calendar
2004, and

GUN

in calendar 2005. We
expect to develop a variety of games on multiple platforms based on these
original properties as well as continue to invest in developing other original
intellectual properties.

We will also continue to evaluate and exploit emerging brands that we
believe have potential to become successful game franchises. For example, we
have a multi-year, multi-property, publishing agreement with DreamWorks LLC
that grants us the exclusive rights to publish video games based on DreamWorks
Animation SKG’s theatrical release “Shrek 2,” which was released in the first
quarter of fiscal 2005, “Shark Tale,” which was released in the second quarter
of fiscal 2005, “Madagascar,” which was released in the first quarter of fiscal
2006, “Over the Hedge,” which was released in the first quarter of fiscal 2007,
and all of their respective sequels, including “Shrek the Third” and “Madagascar
2.”  In addition, during the third
quarter of fiscal 2006, we further enhanced our agreement with DreamWorks
Animation SKG by signing a multi-year agreement which grants us the exclusive
video game rights to four upcoming feature films, “Bee Movie,”  “Kung Fu Panda,” “Rex Havoc,” and “How to
Train Your Dragon,” as well as potential future films in the “Shrek” franchise
beyond the upcoming “Shrek the Third.”

Additionally, we have a

strategic alliance with Harrah’s
Entertainment, Inc. that grants us the exclusive, worldwide interactive
rights to develop and publish “World Series of Poker” video games based on
the popular World Series of Poker Tournament. In the second quarter of
fiscal 2006, we released our first title under this alliance,

World Series of Poker,

which became
the number one poker title of calendar 2005. In fiscal 2007, we plan on
releasing our second title under this alliance,

World Series of
Poker: Tournament of Champions.

We also continue to build on our portfolio of
licensed intellectual property. In February 2006, we signed an agreement
with Hasbro Properties Group granting us the global rights, excluding Japan, to
develop console, hand-held, and PC games based on Hasbro’s “Transformers” brand.
We anticipate releasing the first game concurrently with the July 2007
movie release of the live action “Transformers” film from DreamWorks Pictures
and Paramount Pictures. In May 2006 we signed an agreement with MGM
Interactive and EON Productions Ltd. granting us the rights to develop and
publish interactive entertainment games based on the James Bond license through
2014.

In addition to acquiring or creating high profile
intellectual property, we have also continued our focus on establishing and
maintaining relationships with talented and experienced software development
teams. We have strengthened our internal development capabilities through the
acquisition of several development companies with talented and experienced
teams including the acquisitions of developers Toys For Bob, Inc. in April 2005
and Beenox, Inc.


in
May 2005.

Additionally, in May 2006 we entered into an
agreement to acquire video game publisher RedOctane Inc., the publisher of the
popular Guitar Hero franchise.

We
have development agreements with other top-level, third-party developers such
as id Software, Inc., Edge of Reality, Ltd., and Splash Damage, Ltd.

We
are utilizing these developer relationships, new intellectual property
acquisitions, new original intellectual property creations, and our existing
library of intellectual property to further focus our game development on product
lines that will deliver significant, lasting, and recurring revenues and
operating profits.

Critical Accounting Policies

We have identified the policies below as
critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial
results. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our
business operations is discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies
affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion
on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue from the sale of our
products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers. Certain
products are sold to customers with a street date (the date that products are
made widely available for sale by retailers). For these products we recognize
revenue no earlier than the street date. Revenue from product sales is
recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price
protection. With respect to license agreements that provide customers the right
to make multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenue is
recognized upon delivery of such copies. Per copy royalties on sales that
exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned. In addition, in order to
recognize revenue for both product sales and licensing transactions, persuasive
evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection of the related receivable
must be probable. Revenue recognition also determines the timing of certain
expenses, including cost of sales — intellectual property licenses and cost of
sales — software royalties and amortization.

Sales incentives or other consideration given
by us to our customers is accounted for in accordance with the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue 01-9, “Accounting
for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the
Vendor’s Products).”  In accordance with
EITF Issue 01-9, sales incentives and other consideration that are considered
adjustments of the selling price of our products, such as rebates and product
placement fees, are reflected as reductions of revenue. Sales incentives and
other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received,
such as the appearance of our products in a customer’s national circular ad,
are reflected as sales and marketing expenses.

Allowances for Returns, Price
Protection, Doubtful Accounts, and Inventory Obsolescence.

In determining the appropriate unit shipments
to our customers, we benchmark our titles using historical and industry data. We closely monitor and analyze the historical
performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by
other publishers, and the anticipated timing of other releases in order to
assess future demands of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes
shipped upon title launch and subsequent reorders are evaluated to ensure that
quantities are sufficient to meet the demands from the retail markets but at
the same time, are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel.

We may permit product returns from, or grant
price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price
protection refers to the circumstances when we elect to decrease the wholesale
price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and applicable, allow
customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to Activision with
respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers must meet
to be granted the right to return products or price protection are, among other
things, compliance with applicable payment terms, delivery to us of weekly
inventory and sell-through reports, and consistent participation in the
launches of our premium title releases. We may also consider other
factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market
factors. Management must make estimates of potential future product returns and
price protection related to current period product revenue. We estimate the
amount of future returns and price protection for current period product
revenue utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory
levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer. The
following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and price
protection for a particular title: historical performance of titles in similar
genres, historical


performance of the hardware platform, historical performance of the
brand, console hardware life cycle, Activision sales force and retail customer
feedback, industry pricing, weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory, absolute
quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory, our warehouse on-hand inventory
levels, the title’s recent sell-through history (if available), marketing trade
programs, and competing titles. The relative importance of these factors varies
among titles depending upon, among other items, genre, platform, seasonality,
and sales strategy. Significant management judgments and estimates must be made
and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price
protection in any accounting period. Based upon historical experience we
believe our estimates are reasonable. However, actual returns and price
protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a number
of reasons including, among others, a lack of consumer acceptance of a title,
the release in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor, or
technological obsolescence due to the emergence of new hardware platforms. Material
differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any
period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates
in determining the allowances for returns and price protection. For example, a
1% change in our March 31, 2006 allowance for returns and price protection
would impact net revenues by approximately $1.0 million.

Similarly, management must make estimates of the
uncollectibility of our accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for
doubtful accounts, we analyze the age of current outstanding account balances,
historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness,
current economic trends, and changes in our customers’ payment terms and their
economic condition, as well as whether we can obtain sufficient credit
insurance. Any significant changes in any of these criteria would impact
management’s estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts.

We value inventory at the lower of cost or market. We
regularly review inventory quantities on hand and in the retail channel and
record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on the future
expected demand for our products. Significant changes in demand for our
products would impact management’s estimates in establishing our inventory
provision.

Software Development Costs.

Software development costs include payments
made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well
as direct costs incurred for internally developed products.

We account for software development costs in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 86,
“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed.”  Software development costs
are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and
such costs are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a
product encompasses both technical design documentation and game design
documentation. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur
early in the development cycle. Technological feasibility is evaluated on a
product-by-product basis. Prior to a product’s release, we expense, as part of
cost of sales — software royalties and amortization, capitalized costs when we
believe such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized costs for those products
that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in
the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are
not capitalized are charged immediately to product development expense. We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.
The recoverability of capitalized software
development costs is evaluated based on the expected performance of the
specific products for which the costs relate. Criteria used to evaluate
expected product performance include: 
historical performance of comparable products using comparable technology;
orders for the product prior to its release; and estimated performance of a
sequel product based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is
based.

Commencing upon product release, capitalized software
development costs are amortized to cost of sales — software royalties and
amortization based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected
revenues, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months or less. For
products that have been released in prior periods, we evaluate the future
recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis. The primary
evaluation criterion is actual title performance.

Significant management judgments and estimates are
utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established, as
well as in the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs. In
evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected
product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of
additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales
are less than and/or revised forecasted or actual costs are greater than the
original forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis,
the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any
given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge.


Intellectual Property Licenses.

Intellectual property license costs represent
license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their
trademarks, copyrights, software, technology, or other intellectual property or
proprietary rights in the development of our products. Depending upon the
agreement with the rights holder, we may obtain the rights to use acquired
intellectual property in multiple products over multiple years, or
alternatively, for a single product.

We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized
intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis. The recoverability of capitalized
intellectual property license costs is evaluated based on the expected
performance of the specific products in which the licensed trademark or
copyright is to be used. As many of our intellectual property licenses extend
for multiple products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of
capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative
factors such as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles
utilizing the intellectual property, whether there are any future planned
theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual
property, and the rights holder’s continued promotion and exploitation of the
intellectual property. Prior to the related product’s release, we expense, as part of
cost of sales — intellectual property licenses, capitalized intellectual
property costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized
intellectual property costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned
are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation. Criteria
used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance
of comparable products using comparable technology; orders for the product
prior to its release; and estimated performance of a sequel product based on
the performance of the product on which the sequel is based.

Commencing upon the related product’s release,
capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost of sales
— intellectual property licenses based on the ratio of current revenues for the
specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the
licensed property will be utilized. As intellectual property license contracts may extend
for multiple years, the amortization of capitalized intellectual property
license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year. For
intellectual property included in products that have been released and
unreleased products, we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized
amounts on a quarterly basis. The primary evaluation criterion is actual and
expected title performance.

Significant management
judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of
capitalized costs.

In
evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected
product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of
additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales
are less than, and/or revised forecasted or actual costs are greater than, the
original forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis,
the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any
given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Additionally, as
noted above, as many of our intellectual property licenses extend for multiple
products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized
intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors such
as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the
intellectual property, whether there are any future planned theatrical releases
or television series based on the intellectual property and the rights
holder’s continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property. Material
differences may result in the amount and timing of charges for any period
if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in
evaluating these qualitative factors.


Selected Consolidated Statements of Operations Data

The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of
operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of consolidated net
revenues and also breaks down net revenues by territory, business segment, and
platform, as well as operating income by business segment (in thousands):


Results of Operations – Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
2006 and 2005

Net Revenues

We
primarily derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games
designed for play on video game consoles (such as the PS2, Xbox, Xbox360, and
GameCube), PCs, and hand-held game devices (such as the GBA, NDS, and PSP). We
also derive revenue from our distribution business in Europe that provides
logistical and sales services to third-party publishers of interactive
entertainment software, our own publishing operations and third-party
manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

The following table details our consolidated net revenues by business
segment and our publishing net revenues by territory for the years ended March 31,
2006 and 2005 (in thousands):

Consolidated net revenues increased 4% from $1,405.9 million for the
year ended March 31, 2005 to $1,468.0 million for the year ended March 31,
2006. This increase in consolidated net revenues was solely generated by our
publishing business and was driven by the following:

•

An increase year over year in the number of
titles released. Our fiscal 2006 launch schedule included the largest
slate of new releases in our history. In fiscal 2006, we released seventeen
major titles including the following major releases:

Doom 3

for
the Xbox,

Madagascar, Fantastic Four, Ultimate Spider-Man,
X-Men Legends II, THAW, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, GUN, True
Crime: New York City, Quake 4, Shrek SuperSlam, The Movies, Cabela’s Dangerous
Hunts 2,

and

World Series of Poker.

In addition, four of these titles,

Call of Duty
2, THAW, Quake 4,

and

GUN,

were
released concurrently with the release of the Xbox360 platform at a
premium retail price of $59.99. This compares to fourteen titles in fiscal
2005, which included the following major releases:

Spider-Man 2, Call of Duty: Finest Hour, Tony Hawk’s Underground 2 (“THUG
2”), Shrek 2, X-Men Legends, Doom 3, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of
Unfortunate Events, Shark Tale, Cabela’s Big Game Hunter 2005,

and

Rome: Total War.

Additionally in fiscal 2006, we achieved our goal of increasing the
number of million and multi-million unit selling titles.

•

An increase in
our hand-held platform presence growing publishing hand-held revenues by
$20.2 million or 15% from $138.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2005
to $158.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2006. This was driven by an
increase in the number of hand-held titles released combined with titles being
released across more hand-held platforms with the fiscal 2005 introductions of
the PSP and NDS.

Partially offset by:

•

An increase in provision for return and price
protection throughout fiscal 2006 from 12% of net revenues in fiscal 2005 to
18% of net revenues in fiscal 2006, due to challenging market conditions and
the ongoing console transition.

•

A decrease in net revenues from our
distribution business due mostly to the effect of year over year weakening of
the Euro (“EUR”) and Great Britain Pound (“GBP”) in relation to the United
States Dollar


(“USD”).
Foreign exchange rates decreased reported distribution net revenues by
approximately $14.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2006. Excluding
the impact of changing foreign currency rates, our distribution net revenues
decreased 1% year over year.

Due
to uncertainty with regard to the market, software pricing, and first-party
hardware plans for current and next-generation consoles, we plan on releasing a
more focused slate of titles in fiscal 2007. As a result, we anticipate revenue
will decrease in fiscal 2007 in comparison to the record net revenues achieved
in fiscal 2006.

North America Publishing Net Revenues (in
thousands)

North America publishing net revenues
increased 2% from $696.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2005 to
$710.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2006. The increase reflects
our largest slate of releases in company history and expansion of our hand-held
presence with products for PSP, NDS, and GBA. This was offset by weaker market
conditions resulting in higher provisions for returns and price protection. North
America publishing net revenues decreased as a percentage of consolidated net
revenues from 50% for year ended March 31, 2005 to 48% for the year ended March 31,
2006. The decrease is due to a larger increase in our international publishing
net revenues due to successful expansion efforts into new territories and the
strong performance of our affiliate titles in Europe.

International Publishing Net Revenues (in
thousands)

International publishing net revenues increased by 18% from $376.4
million for the year ended March 31, 2005 to $444.6 million for the year
ended March 31, 2006. Additionally, international publishing net revenues
as a percentage of consolidated net revenues increased from 26% for the year
ended March 31, 2005 to 31% for the year ended March 31, 2006. The
increases were due mainly to our successful expansion efforts into new
territories combined with strong performance from our affiliate label products
which included the successful LucasArts’ titles,

Star Wars:
Revenge of the Sith

and

Star Wars Battlefront II.

The
increase in international publishing net revenues was partially offset by a
weakening of the EUR and the GBP in relation to the USD of approximately $14.5
million. Excluding the impact of changing foreign currency rates, our
international publishing net revenues increased 22% year over year. In the
coming year, we will continue to focus on expanding our international
publishing capabilities and direct-selling efforts in both the European and
Asia-Pacific markets.


Publishing Net Revenues by Platform

Publishing net
revenues increased 8% from $1,072.7 million

for the year
ended March 31, 2005

to $1,154.7
million for the year ended March 31, 2006. The following table details our
publishing net revenues by platform and as a percentage of total
publishing net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 (in
thousands):

Personal Computer Net Revenues (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the PC
decreased 17% from $220.1 million and 21% of publishing net revenues for the
year ended March 31, 2005 to $183.5 million and 16% of publishing net
revenues for the year ended March 31, 2006. The decrease in both absolute
dollars and as a percentage of publishing revenue was due to the slate of PC
titles released in fiscal 2005 in comparison to fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, we
released the highly successful PC titles

Doom

and

Rome: Total War

and
also had strong continued sell through of our catalog title,

Call of Duty.

Although we had strong sales from our fiscal 2006 PC titles,

Call of Duty

2,

The Movies,

and

Quake 4,

in
fiscal 2005, according to NPD Funworld, we were the only publisher to have
three top-ten PC titles for calendar year 2004. We expect fiscal 2007 PC
publishing net revenues to decrease in absolute dollars due to a more focused
slate of titles in fiscal 2007 which includes only one PC exclusive title,

Enemy Territory: Quake Wars

and one expansion pack,

The Movies: Stunts and Effects

. We expect fiscal 2007 PC
publishing net revenues as a percentage of total publishing net revenues to
remain consistent with fiscal 2006.


Sony PlayStation 2 Net Revenues (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the PS2
increased 1% from $417.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2005 to
$422.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2006. The slight increase was
primarily due to an increase in the number of major titles released for the PS2
from seven major titles in fiscal 2005 to nine major titles in fiscal 2006. This
increase was offset by an increase in the provision for returns and price
protection on new releases due to weaker market conditions. In addition,

Madagascar,

which was our fifth best selling PS2 title for
fiscal 2006 in terms of units sold, was released at a lower initial retail
pricing point of $39.99 compared to $49.99 for comparable children’s titles in
fiscal 2005. As a percentage of publishing net revenues, net revenues from
sales of titles for the PS2 decreased from 39% for the year ended March 31,
2005 to 36% for the year ended March 31, 2006. The decrease is due to a
change in our platform revenue mix due to the introduction of the Xbox360.
We expect the installed base of PS2 to continue to grow in fiscal 2007,
although at a slower rate than in previous years, due to the anticipated
release of the next-generation PS3 console system in calendar 2006.

However, due to the market uncertainty
involving the transition to the next-generation console systems, we plan on
releasing a more focused slate in fiscal 2007 resulting in a significant
decrease in PS2 titles from fiscal 2006 where we had the largest slate of
titles in our history. As a result, we expect net revenues from sales of titles
for the PS2 to decrease in fiscal 2007 in comparison to fiscal 2006. We expect
the release of the PS3 to have a small impact on fiscal 2007 net revenues given
the initially low installed base.

Microsoft Xbox Net Revenues (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the
Xbox increased 5% from $196.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2005 to
$205.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2006 and held steady as a
percentage of publishing net revenues at 18%. The increase was primarily
attributable to the strong performance of our first quarter fiscal 2006 Xbox
exclusive release of

Doom 3

which
had no comparable Xbox exclusive title released in fiscal 2005

.

This increase was offset by increased provisions for
returns and price protection in anticipation of quicker required pricing
actions as a result of the introduction of the Xbox360, which is expected to
result in a gradual slowdown in sales for the Xbox as customers upgrade or
anticipate upgrading to the next-generation platform. We expect our fiscal 2007
net revenues from sales of titles for the Xbox to decrease versus fiscal 2006
due to fewer anticipated title releases for the Xbox in fiscal 2007 combined
with a declining customer base as the Xbox360 hardware becomes more readily
available and its installed base grows.

Microsoft Xbox360 Net Revenues (in thousands)

The Xbox360 was released in November 2005
and was the first of the next-generation hardware to be released. Consistent
with our goal of having a significant presence at the launch of each new
platform, we released four titles concurrently with the release of the Xbox360,

Call of Duty 2, THAW, Quake 4,

and

GUN.

All of these titles


were released at premium retail pricing of $59.99. Although limited by
hardware availability in fiscal 2006, we experienced strong sales of these four
titles, and, according to NPD Funworld,

Call of Duty 2

was
the number one title on the Xbox360 and had the highest attach rate of any
console launch in video game history. We expect the Xbox360 to provide
significant opportunity for us in the upcoming fiscal years. In fiscal 2007, we
expect net revenues from sales of titles for the Xbox360 to continue to
increase over what we achieved in fiscal 2006.

Nintendo GameCube Net Revenues (in thousands)

Net revenues
from sales of titles for the Nintendo GameCube decreased 16% from $96.9 million
for the year ended March 31, 2005 to $81.0 million for the year ended March 31,
2006. Despite an increase in the number of titles released for the GameCube
from seven major titles for the year ended March 31, 2005 to nine major
titles for the year ended March 31, 2006, the releases in fiscal 2006,
which included

GUN, Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, THAW,

and

True Crime: New York City,

were less
geared toward the demographics of the GameCube audience as compared to our
fiscal 2005 title releases, which included

Spider-Man 2

and

Shrek 2.

Additionally,

Madagascar,

which was our top selling title on the GameCube
in fiscal 2006,

was released at a lower initial
retail pricing of $39.99 as compared to

Spider-Man 2

and

Shrek 2

, which were both released at an
initial retail price of $49.99.

Madagascar

was
our top selling title on the GameCube for fiscal 2006 and although it performed
strongly, it compares to fiscal 2005 where our top two selling titles on the
GameCube were

Spider-Man 2

and

Shrek 2,

each of which outperformed

Madagascar.

We
expect fiscal 2007 net revenues for the GameCube to decrease over fiscal 2006
due to our more focused fiscal 2007 title slate and the next-generation
platforms gaining market share over current-generation platforms such as the
GameCube. It is anticipated that Nintendo

will release their next-generation console,
the Wii, in calendar 2006. Given the initially low installed base, we expect
the release of the Wii to have little initial impact on our net revenues.

Hand-held (in thousands)

Net revenues
from sales of titles for the hand-held for the year ended March 31, 2006
increased 15% from the prior fiscal year, from $138.7 million to $158.9 million.
Additionally, hand-held net revenues as a percentage of publishing net revenues
increased from 13% for the year ended March 31, 2005 to 14% for the year
ended March 31, 2006. The increases were due to the worldwide introductions
of the NDS and PSP hand-held platforms in late fiscal 2005 and the continued
growth of their installed base throughout fiscal 2006, which resulted in
hand-held titles being sold across more platforms. In addition, compared to the
other hand-held platforms, titles for the PSP have a higher retail pricing
point of $49.99. The major titles driving hand-held net revenues in fiscal 2006
were

Madagascar, Madagascar: Operation Penguin,
Fantastic Four, Ultimate Spider-Man,

and

Shrek
SuperSlam

for the GBA;

Madagascar, Ultimate
Spider-Man, Tony Hawk’s American Sk8land,

and

Shrek
SuperSlam

for the NDS; and

THUG 2, Spider-Man 2,
X-Men Legends II,

and LucasArts’

Star Wars Battlefront II

for
the PSP. This compares to fiscal 2005 where the main titles driving hand-held
net revenues were

Shrek 2, Spider-Man 2,

and

DreamWorks’ Shark Tale

for the GBA;

Spider-Man 2

for the NDS; and

THUG 2

and

Spider-Man 2

for the PSP.

With the installed base of the PSP, NDS, and
GBA continuing to increase and the PSP expanding the demographic of the
hand-held gamer, we expect that fiscal 2007 hand-held net revenues to continue
to increase year over year.

Overall

The platform mix of our future publishing net
revenues will likely be impacted by a number of factors, including the ability
of hardware manufacturers to continue to increase their installed hardware base
and the


introduction of new hardware platforms, as well as the performance of
key product releases from our product release schedule. We expect that net
revenues from console titles will continue to represent the largest component
of our publishing net revenues with PS2 having the largest percentage of that
business due to its larger installed hardware base. However, during fiscal
2007, we expect the introduction of the PS3 and Wii next-generation console
systems and a higher installed base of the Xbox360 will continue to decrease
the percentage of PS2 business throughout the year. With the installed base of
the NDS and PSP platforms continuing to increase, we also expect to see a
continued increase in our hand-held business in line with the growth in the
installed base in comparison to prior periods. Our net revenues from PC titles
will be primarily driven by our product release schedule.

A
significant portion of our revenues and profits are derived from a relatively
small number of popular titles and brands each year as revenues and profits are
significantly affected by our ability to release highly successful titles. For
example, for the year ended March 31, 2006, 20% of our consolidated net
revenues and 26% of worldwide publishing net revenues were derived from net
revenues from our

Call of Duty 2, THAW,

and

Call of Duty 2: Big Red One

titles. Though many of these
titles have substantial production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets,
once a title recoups these costs, incremental net revenues directly and
positively impact operating profits resulting in a disproportionate amount of
operating income being derived from these select titles. We expect that a
limited number of titles and brands will continue to produce a
disproportionately large amount of our net revenues and profits.

Three key factors that could affect future
publishing and distribution net revenue performance are console hardware
pricing, software pricing, and transitions in console platforms. As console
hardware moves through its life cycle, hardware manufacturers typically enact
price reductions. Reductions in the price of console hardware typically result in
an increase in the installed base of hardware owned by consumers. Historically,
we have also seen that lower console hardware prices put downward pressure on
software pricing. While we expect console software launch pricing for the
Xbox360 to hold at $59.99, we have noticed downward pressure on the prices of
current-generation software. Additionally, when new console platforms are
announced or introduced into the market, such as the upcoming 2006 calendar
year releases of the PS3 and Wii and the November 2005 release of the
Xbox360, consumers typically reduce their purchases of game console
entertainment software products for current console platforms in anticipation
of new platforms becoming available. During these periods, sales of our game
console entertainment software products may be expected to slow or even
decline until new platforms are introduced and achieve wide consumer
acceptance.

Distribution Net Revenues (in thousands)

Distribution net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2006
decreased 6% from the prior fiscal year, from $333.1 million to $313.3 million.
Foreign exchange rates decreased reported distribution net revenues by
approximately $14.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2006.

Excluding
the impact of the changing foreign currency rates, our distribution net
revenues decreased $4.9 million or 1% year over year.

The remaining year over year decrease was
primarily due to the termination of relationships with unprofitable publishers
and stronger third-party releases in fiscal 2005.

The mix of distribution net revenues
between hardware and software sales varied year over year with approximately
20% of distribution net revenues from hardware sales in the year ended March 31,
2006 as compared to 13% in the prior fiscal year. This was mainly attributed to
the release of the PSP in Europe in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and the
release of the Xbox360 in November 2005. In both fiscal years, hardware
sales were principally comprised of sales of console hardware. The mix of
future distribution net revenues will be driven by a number of factors
including the occurrence of further hardware price reductions instituted by
hardware manufacturers, the introduction of new hardware platforms, and our
ability to establish and maintain distribution agreements with hardware
manufacturers and third-party software publishers. We expect our fiscal 2007
distribution net revenues to decrease when compared with fiscal 2006 due to
uncertainty with regard to the software market as a result of the transition
from current-generation console system to the next-generation Xbox360, PS3, and
Wii and a more focused slate of Activision titles.


Costs and Expenses

Cost of Sales – Product Costs (in thousands)

Cost of sales – product costs represented 50%
and 47% of consolidated net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2006
and 2005, respectively.

In absolute dollars, cost of sales — product costs increased 12% from
$658.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2005 to $734.9 million for the
year ended March 31, 2006. The primary factors affecting the increase in
cost of sales – product costs in absolute dollars and as a percentage of
consolidated net revenues were:

•

Volume growth in our European territories of
LucasArts’

Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith,

and

Star Wars Battlefront II.

LucasArts’
titles are part of our affiliate label program and carry a significantly
higher product cost than Activision developed titles.

•

Write-downs of inventory costs for certain
titles in fiscal 2006 in the amount of $14.5 million due to the high level of
inventory for certain titles at the end of our third quarter of fiscal 2006. At
the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 we reviewed the levels of inventory
and determined that, due to lower than expected re-orders caused by weaker
market conditions and the ongoing console transition, we anticipated that
certain titles in our inventory would likely be sold below its original cost.

•

A decrease in our PC net revenues as a
percentage of publishing net revenues from 21% in fiscal 2005 to 16% in fiscal
2006. Products for PC typically have lower costs of sales – product costs
associated with them as they do not require royalty payments to hardware
manufacturers.

•

An increase in
provision for returns and price protection throughout fiscal 2006 from 12% of
net revenues in fiscal 2005 compared to 18% of net revenues in fiscal 2006, due
to challenging market conditions and the ongoing console transition.

•

An increase in
consolidated net revenues of 4% from $1,405.9 million for the year ended March 31,
2005 to $1,468.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2006.

•

Reduced pricing on a number of catalog titles
as well as new releases in our kids genre.

We expect cost of sales — product costs as a
percentage of net revenues to remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue
in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. This is primarily due to slightly
higher product costs related to next-generation titles offset by higher retail
pricing on next-generation titles which are anticipated to retail for $59.99.


Cost of Sales

–

Software Royalties and Amortization (in thousands)

Cost of sales – software royalties and
amortization for the year ended March 31, 2006 increased as a percentage
of publishing net revenues from the prior fiscal year, from 12% to 13%. In
absolute dollars, cost of sales – software royalties and amortization for the
year ended March 31, 2006 also increased from the prior fiscal year, from
$123.8 million to $147.8 million. The increases in cost of sales – software
royalties and amortization in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of
publishing net revenues were mainly due to:

•

Impairment
charges and recoverability write-offs of $12.6 million in fiscal 2006. We
performed a detailed review of capitalized costs for released titles and
determined that expected future revenues, given the change in market
conditions, on certain titles would not support the remaining capitalized
software balance on these titles. As a result, we incurred a $3.8 million
recoverability charge on these titles in fiscal 2006. In addition, we reviewed
future recoverability of capitalized amounts on titles in development and
determined that one of our titles, to be released in fiscal 2007, was unlikely
to fully recover capitalized costs given the change in expectations as a result
of weaker market conditions and uncertainty involved in the console transition
and, as a result, took an impairment charge of $8.8 million on this title.

•

Overall
continued increases in costs to develop titles for additional platforms,
particularly those titles released for the more technologically advanced
next-generation console platforms.

Due to market uncertainty associated with the ongoing
console transition to the next-generation hardware and our more focused fiscal
2007 title slate, we expect costs of sales – software royalties and
amortization to decrease in fiscal 2007 in proportion to the expected decrease
in net revenues.

Cost of Sales – Intellectual Property
Licenses (in thousands)

Cost of sales – intellectual property
licenses for the year ended March 31, 2006 decreased in absolute dollars
and as a percentage of publishing net revenues over the same period last year,
from $62.2 million to $57.7 and from 6% to 5%, respectively.

The decreases in both absolute dollars and as
a percentage of publishing net revenues were due mainly to a one-time benefit
related to the settlement of an intellectual property claim in the second
quarter of fiscal 2006. The number of titles with associated intellectual
property remained relatively flat year over year. In fiscal 2006, we released
the following titles with associated intellectual property:

Doom 3

for the Xbox,

Madagascar, Fantastic
Four, Ultimate Spider-Man, X-Men Legends II, THAW, Quake IV,

and

Shrek SuperSlam.

In fiscal 2005 we released the
following titles with associated intellectual property:

Spider-Man 2, Shrek 2, Shark Tale, X-Men Legends,
THUG 2, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events,

and

Doom 3.

We expect cost of sales –
intellectual property licenses for fiscal 2007 to remain relatively flat as a
percentage of publishing net revenues but to decrease in absolute dollars in
proportion to the expected decrease in net revenues in fiscal 2007.


Product Development (in thousands)

Product development expenses for the year
ended March 31, 2006 increased as a percentage of publishing net revenues
from the prior fiscal year, from 8% to 11%. In absolute dollars, product
development expenses for the year ended March 31, 2006 also increased from
the prior fiscal year, from $86.5 million to $131.8 million. The increase in
product development expenses both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of
publishing net revenues was due to:

•

Increased development, quality assurance, and
outside developer costs as a result of the development of more technologically
advanced titles across more platforms.

•

Product
cancellation charges of $11.4 million, including termination fees, incurred
during fiscal 2006. Given the market conditions, the lower than expected
performance of some of our third quarter fiscal 2006 releases, and risks
associated with console transition, we performed a thorough review of our
upcoming product slate. To better align opportunities associated with the
next-generation console platforms with income potential and risks associated
with certain titles in development, we canceled development of certain titles
and permanently removed them from our future title slate.

•

Increased costs in fiscal 2006 related to the
full year operation of three recently acquired studios, Vicarious Visions, Inc.,
Toys for Bob, Inc., and Beenox, Inc., as well as costs incurred to
fund more product development capacity at certain studios.

For fiscal 2007, we expect product development costs
to increase as a percentage of net revenues due to the increased costs related
to developing more technologically advanced titles for the next-generation
console systems. Over time, we intend to offset increased development costs of
the next-generation console systems by sharing technologies and tools across
multiple platforms, increasing our development schedules to facilitate a longer
pre-production phase and more predictable workflow times, and outsourcing
certain areas of game development to lower cost service providers.

Sales and Marketing (in thousands)

Sales and marketing expenses of $283.2
million and $230.1 million represented 19% and 16% of consolidated net revenues
for the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. T

he increases in both absolute dollars and as a
percentage of net revenues was primarily generated by our publishing business
as a result of significant marketing programs including television and
in-theatre ad campaigns and in-store promotions to support our biggest product
release slate in company history. The increase in sales and marketing
investment as a percentage of net revenues was a result of additional sales and
marketing investment during the key holiday season which did not provide the
revenue increase that was anticipated at the time that the marketing costs were
incurred.

We expect sales and marketing expense to decrease on
both an absolute basis and as a percentage of consolidated net revenues in
fiscal 2007 due to a more focused slate in fiscal 2007 and due to a more
targeted sales and marketing plan.


General and Administrative (in thousands)

General and administrative expenses for the year
ended March 31, 2006 increased $34.9 million over the same period last
year, from $59.7 million to $94.7 million. As a percentage of consolidated net
revenues, general and administrative expenses increased from 4% to 7%. The
increases were primarily due to an increase in personnel costs including costs
related to European territory expansion, separation and severance costs
associated with a less than 7% reduction in workforce in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2006, increased bad debt write-offs, an increase in foreign
currency transaction losses, and increased legal costs.

We expect general and administrative expenses
to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal 2007 as we realize the benefits of a
more efficient cost structure resulting from the recent workforce realignment
partially offset by increases in compensation expense related to the
implementation of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123
(revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment.

Operating Income

(in thousands)

Publishing operating income for the year ended March 31, 2006
decreased $164.8 million from the same period last year, from $160.8 million to
an operating loss of $4.0 million. Changes in exchange rates related to the
year over year weakening of the EUR, GBP, and Australian dollar (“AUD”) in
relation to the USD did not have a material impact on publishing operating
income. The decrease is primarily due to:

•

Increased sales
and marketing spending to support our large title release slate.

•

An increase in
provision for returns and price protection throughout fiscal 2006 from 12% of
net revenues in fiscal 2005 compared to 18% of net revenues in fiscal 2006, due
to challenging market conditions and the ongoing console transition.

•

Cancellation,
impairment, and earn-out recoverability charges totaling $24.0 million taken in
fiscal 2006. See additional description of charges incurred in the cost of
sales – software royalties and amortization and the product development
discussions.

•

Write-downs of
inventory costs of $14.5 million taken during fiscal 2006. See additional
description in the cost of sales – product costs discussion.

Distribution operating income for the year
ended March 31, 2006 decreased over the same period last year, from $23.7
million to $21.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of
changes in foreign currency rates on distribution operating income of
approximately $1.4 million. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency
rates, distribution operating income for the year ended March 31, 2006
decreased approximately $0.4 million or 2% from the same period last year.


Investment Income, Net

(in thousands)

Investment income, net for the year ended March 31, 2006 was $30.6
million as compared to $13.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2005.

The increase was primarily due to higher
invested balances combined with rising yields, a realized gain in the first
quarter of fiscal 2006 of $1.3 million on the sale of an investment in common
stock, and a realized gain of $2.9 million on the sale of a cost basis
investment during the year ended March 31, 2006 as compared to 2005.

Provision for Income Taxes

(in thousands)

The income tax provision of $6.7 million for
the year ended March 31, 2006 reflects our effective income tax rate of
13.8%. The significant items that generated the variance between our effective
rate and our statutory rate of 35% were research and development tax credits
and the impact of foreign tax rate differentials, partially offset by an
increase in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and state taxes. The
realization of deferred tax assets depends primarily on the generation of
future taxable income. We believe that it is more likely than not that we will
generate taxable income sufficient to realize the benefit of net deferred tax
assets recognized.

Net Income

Net income for the year ended March 31, 2006 was $41.9 million or
$0.14 per diluted share, as compared to $138.3 million or $0.50 per diluted
share for the year ended March 31, 2005.


Results of Operations – Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
2005 and 2004

Net Revenues

We
primarily derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games
designed for play on video game consoles (such as the PS2, Xbox, and GameCube),
PCs, and hand-held game devices (such as the GBA, NDS, and PSP). We also derive
revenue from our distribution business in Europe that provides logistical and
sales services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software,
our own publishing operations, and third-party manufacturers of interactive
entertainment hardware.

The following table details our consolidated net revenues by business
segment and our publishing net revenues by territory for the years ended March 31,
2005 and 2004 (in thousands):

Consolidated net revenues increased 48% from $947.7 million for the
year ended March 31, 2004 to $1,405.9 million for the year ended March 31,
2005. This increase was principally generated by our publishing business. The
increase in consolidated net revenues was driven by the following:

•

Strong performances from our publishing
business on the releases of our largest ever lineup of titles including:

Spider-Man 2, Call of Duty: Finest Hour, THUG 2,
Shrek 2, X-Men Legends, Doom 3, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate
Events, Shark Tale, Cabela’s Big Game Hunter 2005,

and

Rome: Total War.

The strength of
these titles combined with the significant sales and marketing investment led
to over ten million-unit selling titles and achievement of our goal of having
four multi-million-unit selling titles. We
also had strong catalog sales from a number of our franchises including Tony
Hawk, True Crime, Spider-Man, and Call of Duty. As a result of the
strong performance of our key fiscal 2005 releases, we were able to maintain
the original price points for those titles for an extended period of time.

•

Continued focus
on international publishing expansion with the opening of offices in Spain and
Italy and an increased focus on other territories contributing to an increase
in International Publishing revenues of 72% over fiscal 2004.

•

An increase in our
hand-held platform presence growing consolidated hand-held revenues by
$118.7 million or 274% from $43.3 million for the year ended March 31,
2004 to $162.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2005. This was driven
by a significant increase in the number of GBA titles released from four titles
in fiscal 2004 to eleven titles in fiscal 2005, and by the introduction of the
PSP and NDS platforms, for which we released a combined total of three titles.

•

International
net revenues benefited from the year over year strengthening of the Euro (“EUR”)
and Great British Pound (“GBP”) in relation to the U.S. dollar. We estimate
that foreign exchange rates increased reported net revenues by approximately
$55.3 million. Excluding the impact of changing foreign currency rates, our
international net revenues increased 31% year over year.


North America Publishing Net Revenues (in
thousands)

North America publishing net revenues
increased 56% from $446.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2004, to
$696.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2005. The increase reflects
the strong performance of our fiscal 2005 slate of titles, strong
catalog sales from a number of our franchises,

and a significant
increase in our hand-held platform presence.

International Publishing Net Revenues (in
thousands)

International publishing net revenues increased by 72% from $218.9
million for the year ended March 31, 2004, to $376.4 million for the year
ended March 31, 2005. International publishing also saw strong results
from our 2005 titles

,

as well as
strong fourth quarter performance in our LucasArts affiliate business

.

In addition, we had strong catalog sales
from a number of our franchises, including Spider-Man, Call of Duty, Tony Hawk,
and True Crime. There also was a positive strengthening of the EUR and the GBP
in relation to the U.S. dollar of approximately $29.0 million. Excluding the
impact of changing foreign currency rates, our international publishing net
revenues increased 59% year over year.


Publishing Net Revenues by Platform

Publishing net revenues increased 61% from $665.7 million for the year
ended March 31, 2004 to $1,072.7 million for the year ended March 31,
2005. The following table details our publishing net revenues by platform and
as a percentage of total publishing net revenues for the years ended March 31,
2005 and 2004 (in thousands):

Personal Computer Net Revenues (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the PC
increased 66% from $132.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2004 to
$220.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2005. Driving the increase
were the fiscal 2005 releases of

Doom 3

and

Rome: Total War

combined with
continued strong sell through of our catalog title,

Call of Duty.

According to NPD, we were the only publisher to have three top-ten PC titles
for calendar year 2004:

Doom 3, Call of
Duty,

and

Rome: Total War.

Also
contributing to the increase in net revenues from sales of titles for the PC
was an increase in the total number of titles shipped from eight in fiscal 2004
to fifteen in fiscal 2005.


Sony PlayStation 2 Net Revenues (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the PS2
increased 44% from $289.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2004 to
$417.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2005. The increase was
primarily due to strong, worldwide sales of several of our fiscal 2005 releases
including

THUG 2, Call of Duty: Finest Hour, X-Men Legends, Spider-Man
2, Shrek 2, Shark Tale,

Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events,

and

Cabela’s
Big Game Hunter 2005.

In fiscal 2005 we released thirteen titles for
PS2 compared to ten in fiscal 2004 which included:

True Crime:
Streets of L.A., Tony Hawk’s Underground, X2: Wolverine’s Revenge, Return to
Castle Wolfenstein, Cabela’s Dangerous Hunts,

and

Cabela’s Deer Hunt 2004 Season.

Microsoft Xbox
Net Revenues (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the
Xbox increased 36% from $145.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2004
to $196.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2005. Though the number of
new Xbox titles remained relatively consistent from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005,
we were able to increase our Xbox sales in both the North America and
international markets. The increase was primarily due to strong worldwide sales
of several of our Xbox titles including

THUG 2, Call of Duty: Finest
Hour, X-Men Legends, Spider-Man 2, Shrek 2, Shark Tale,

Greg Hastings’ Tournament
Paintball,

and

Cabela’s Big Game Hunter 2005.

The
increase was also affected by an increased installed base of the Xbox due
mainly to the price cuts on the Xbox hardware in calendar 2004.

Nintendo
GameCube Net Revenues (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the
Nintendo GameCube increased 83% from $52.9 million for the year ended March 31,
2004 to $96.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2005. The increase is
primarily due to the increase in the number of GameCube new title releases from
five in fiscal 2004 to eight in fiscal 2005. Also driving the increase in
revenues was that the title slate in fiscal 2005 performed strongly as it was
more targeted toward the demographic of the GameCube audience than the fiscal
2004 GameCube title slate. Our fiscal 2005 title slate was driven by new title
releases of

Shrek 2, Spider-Man 2, Shark
Tale,

Lemony Snicket’s A Series of
Unfortunate Events

, THUG
2,

and

Call of Duty: Finest Hour.

Fiscal 2004 GameCube revenues were driven mainly by releases of

Tony Hawk’s Underground

and

True Crime: 
Streets of L.A

.


Hand-held (in
thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the
hand-held for the year ended March 31, 2005 increased 456% from the prior
fiscal year, from $24.9 million to $138.7 million. This was driven mainly by a
significant increase in the number of GBA titles released from four titles in
fiscal 2004 to eleven titles in fiscal 2005 and the introduction of two new
hand-held devices, NDS, which was released worldwide, and PSP, which was
released in North America. We successfully executed our strategy of having a
high-quality presence at the launch of both the NDS and PSP platforms with one
title based on the Spider-Man franchise at the launch of the NDS and two titles
based on the Spider-Man and Tony Hawk franchises for the launch of the PSP. In
addition to the increase in the number of GBA titles released,

we implemented a customized marketing plan for
the GBA platform and demographic to support a strong slate of new releases
including

THUG 2, Shrek 2: Beg for Mercy!,
Shark Tale

,

Lemony Snicket’s A Series of
Unfortunate Events

, Spider-Man 2,

and

Shrek 2

which were all
targeted toward the demographic of the GBA audience.

Overall

A significant portion of our revenues and profits is derived from a
relatively small number of popular titles and brands each year as revenues and
profits are significantly affected by our ability to release highly successful
or “hit” titles. For example, for the year ended March 31, 2005, 31% of
our consolidated net revenues and 41% of worldwide publishing net revenues were
derived from net revenues from our

Spider-Man
2, THUG 2,

and

Call of Duty:
Finest Hour

titles. Though many titles have substantial production or
acquisition costs and marketing budgets, once a title recoups these costs,
incremental net revenues directly and positively impact operating profits
resulting in a disproportionate amount of operating income being derived from
these select titles.

Distribution Net Revenues (in thousands)

Distribution net revenues for the year ended March 31,
2005 increased 18% from the prior fiscal year, from $281.9 million to $333.1
million. Excluding the impact of the changing foreign currency rates, our
distribution net revenues increased 9% year over year. About half of this
increase was due to the positive impact of the year over year strengthening of
the EUR and the GBP in relation to the U.S. dollar.

The increase was primarily due to the
continued growth in the industry wide software market, an increase in sales to
mass merchants, as well as a change in the product mix. The mix of
distribution net revenues between hardware and software sales varied year over
year with approximately 13% of distribution net revenues from hardware sales in
the year ended March 31, 2005 as compared to 28% in the prior fiscal year.
This was mainly attributed to an increase in business with large, mass-market
customers that generate a higher percentage of sales from software. In both
fiscal years, hardware sales were principally comprised of sales of console
hardware.


Costs and Expenses

Cost of Sales – Product Costs (in thousands)

Cost of sales – product costs represented 47%
and 50% of consolidated net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

In absolute dollars, cost of sales — product costs increased 39% due to
significantly higher sales in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The
primary factors affecting the reduction in the cost of sales — product costs as
a percentage of consolidated net revenues were:

•

Increased ability to maintain premium pricing
on “big proposition” titles for the year ended March 31, 2005.

•

An increase in publishing net revenues from
sales of PC titles by 66% year over year. PC publishing revenues as a percent
of publishing net revenues for the year also grew from 20% to 21%. PC titles
typically have lower product costs associated with them.

•

A lower percentage of revenues generated from
our distribution business, which is a lower margin business, in fiscal 2005 as
compared to fiscal 2004.

Cost of Sales

–

Software Royalties and Amortization (in thousands)

Cost of sales – software royalties and
amortization for the year ended March 31, 2005 increased as a percentage
of publishing net revenues from the prior fiscal year, from 9% to 12%. In absolute
dollars, cost of sales – software royalties and amortization for the year ended
March 31, 2005 also increased from the prior fiscal year, from $59.7
million to $123.8 million.

This increase was due to an increase in the number of titles released as
well as an increase in the overall costs to develop games

.

This compares to fiscal 2004 in which a
higher proportion of revenues were derived from internally developed titles
with lower associated game development costs.

Cost of Sales – Intellectual Property
Licenses (in thousands)

Cost of sales – intellectual property
licenses for the year ended March 31, 2005 increased in absolute dollars
and as a percentage of publishing net revenues over the same period last year,
from 5% to 6%.

The
increases in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of publishing net
revenues were due to the release of more titles with associated licensed
intellectual property as well as continued strong catalog sales of titles with
associated licensed intellectual property compared to the titles released in
fiscal 2004 for which a higher proportion of revenues was derived from titles
that were internally developed with no associated intellectual property. In
fiscal 2005 we released the following titles with associated intellectual
property:

Spider-Man 2, Shrek 2, Shark Tale,
X-Men Legends, THUG 2, Lemony


Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate
Events,

and

Doom 3.

In fiscal 2004, two of our top performing titles,

True Crime: Streets of L.A.

and

Call of Duty,

were based on our wholly-owned
original intellectual property.

Product Development (in thousands)

Product development expenses for the year
ended March 31, 2005 decreased as a percentage of publishing net revenues
from the prior fiscal year, from 15% to 8%. In absolute dollars, product
development expenses for the year ended March 31, 2005 also decreased from
the prior fiscal year, from $97.9 million to $86.5 million. The decrease in
product development as a percentage of publishing net revenues and in absolute
dollars primarily resulted from

a pre-tax charge of approximately $21 million taken in the third
quarter of fiscal 2004 related to the cancellation of products which were
believed to be unlikely to produce an acceptable level of return on our
investment. Excluding the impact of the pre-tax charge, product development
expenses for the year ended March 31, 2005 increased by approximately $9.7
million. This increase was attributable to higher game development costs as
development time and team sizes as well as quality assurance time increased due
to enhanced production values and to support more complex and robust gaming
experiences.

Sales and Marketing (in thousands)

Sales and marketing expenses of $230.1
million and $128.2 million represented 16% and 14% of consolidated net revenues
for the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. T

he increases in both absolute dollars and as a
percentage of net revenues was primarily generated by our publishing business
as a result of significant marketing programs, including television and
in-theatre ad campaigns and in-store promotions, run in support of our key
fiscal 2005 “big proposition” title releases

Spider-Man

,

Shrek 2, Doom 3, Shark Tale,
X-Men Legends, THUG 2, Call of Duty: Finest Hour,

and

Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events.

Our experience has shown that this increased spending will lengthen
the product sales life cycle and add to the long-term prospects of the
respective product lines.

General and Administrative (in thousands)

General and administrative expenses of $59.7
million and $44.6 million represented 4% and 5% of consolidated net revenues
for the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in
absolute dollars was primarily due to

an increase in headcount and related costs to
support business growth, as well as an increase in professional services fees
to support Sarbanes-Oxley related compliance. The decrease as a percentage of
consolidated net revenues was due mainly to the significant increase in sales
volume.


Operating
Income (in thousands)

Publishing
operating income for the year ended March 31, 2005 increased $67.6 million from
the same period last year, from $93.2 million to $160.8 million.  Excluding the impact of changes in foreign
currency rates, publishing operating income for the year ended March 31, 2005
increased approximately $56.7 million from the same period last year.  International publishing operating income for
the year ended March 31, 2005 benefited from the positive impact of the year
over year strengthening of the EUR and the GBP in relation to the U.S.
dollar.  The $56.7 million increase is
primarily due to:

•

Strong
performance in both the North America and international markets of our fiscal
2005 title releases.  The strong
performance of the fiscal 2005 releases was driven by our largest lineup ever
of big propositions, a record number of million-unit and multi-million unit
titles, and an increased hand-held presence.

Partially
offset by:

•

Increased
sales and marketing spending.

•

Increased
cost of sales – product costs, cost of sales – software royalties and
amortization, and cost of sales – intellectual property licenses.

Distribution operating income for the year ended March 31, 2005
increased over the same period last year, from $16.6 million to $23.7
million.  Excluding the impact of changes
in foreign currency rates, distribution operating income for the year ended
March 31, 2005 increased approximately $5.4 million from the same period last
year.  Distribution operating income for
the year ended March 31, 2005 benefited from the positive impact of the year
over year strengthening of the EUR and the GBP in relation to the U.S. dollar.  The $5.4 million increase was primarily due
to

continued growth
industry wide in the software market combined with a change in the product mix
of hardware versus software sales as software tends to be a higher margin
business.

Investment Income, Net

(in thousands)

Investment
income, net for the year ended March 31, 2005 was $13.1 million as compared to
$6.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2004.

The increase
was primarily due to higher invested balances combined with rising yields
during the year ended March 31, 2005 as compared to 2004.


Provision for Income Taxes

(in thousands)

The income tax provision of $59.3 million for the year ended March 31,
2005 reflects our effective income tax rate of 30%.  The significant items that generated the
variance between our effective rate and our statutory rate of 35% were research
and development tax credits and the impact of foreign tax rate differentials,
partially offset by an increase in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance
and state taxes.  The realization of
deferred tax assets depends primarily on the generation of future taxable
income.  We believe that it is more
likely than not that we will generate taxable income sufficient to realize the
benefit of net deferred tax assets recognized.

Net Income

Net income for
the year ended March 31, 2005 was $138.3 million or $0.50 per diluted share, as
compared to $77.7 million or $0.30 per diluted share for the year ended March
31, 2004.


Selected Quarterly Operating Results

Our quarterly
operating results have in the past varied significantly and will likely vary
significantly in the future, depending on numerous factors, several of which
are not under our control.    See Item 1A
- - “Risk Factors.”  Our business also has
experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant seasonality,
largely due to consumer buying patterns and our product release schedule
focusing on those patterns.  Net revenues
typically are significantly higher during the fourth calendar quarter,
primarily due to the increased demand for consumer software during the year-end
holiday buying season.  Accordingly, we
believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not
necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future
performance.

The following
table is a comparative breakdown of our quarterly results for the immediately
preceding eight quarters (amounts in thousands, except per share data):

(1)

Consolidated
financial information has been restated for the effect of our four-for-three
stock split effected in the form of a 33-1/3% stock dividend to shareholders of
record as of October 10, 2005, paid October 24, 2005.


Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Sources of
Liquidity

As of March 31, 2006, our primary source of liquidity is comprised of
$354.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $590.6 million of short-term
investments.  Over the last two years,
our primary sources of liquidity have included cash on hand at the beginning of
the year and cash flows generated from continuing operations.  We have also generated significant cash flows
from the issuance of our common stock to employees through the exercise of
options, which is described in more detail below in “Cash Flows from Financing
Activities.”  We have not utilized debt
financing as a significant source of cash flows.  However, we do have available at certain of
our international locations, credit facilities, which are described below in “Credit
Facilities,” that can be utilized if needed.

In August 2003, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
two amended shelf registration statements, including the base prospectuses
therein. The first shelf registration statement, on Form S-3, allows us, at any
time, to offer any combination of securities described in the base prospectus
in one or more offerings with an aggregate initial offering price of up to
$500,000,000.  Unless we state otherwise
in the applicable prospectus supplement, we expect to use the net proceeds from
the sale of the securities for general corporate purposes, including capital
expenditures, working capital, repayment or reduction of long-term and
short-term debt, and the financing of acquisitions and other business
combinations.  We may invest funds that
we do not immediately require in marketable securities.

The second shelf registration statement, on Form S-4, allows us, at any
time, to offer any combination of securities described in the base prospectus
in one or more offerings with an aggregate initial offering price of up to
$250,000,000 in connection with our acquisition of the assets, business, or
securities of other companies whether by purchase, merger, or any other form of
business combination.

We believe that we have sufficient working capital ($923.9 million at
March 31, 2006), as well as proceeds available from our international credit
facilities, to finance our operational requirements for at least the next
twelve months, including purchases of inventory and equipment, the funding of
the development, production, marketing and sale of new products, and the
acquisition of intellectual property rights for future products from third
parties.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

The primary source of cash flows from operating activities typically
have included the collection of customer receivables generated by the sale of
our products, offset by payments to vendors for the manufacture, distribution,
and marketing of our products, third-party developers and intellectual property
holders, and our own employees.  A
significant operating use of our cash relates to our continued investment in
software development and intellectual property licenses.  We spent approximately $193.9 million and
$126.9 million in the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in
connection with the acquisition of publishing or distribution rights for
products being developed by third parties, the execution of new license
agreements granting us long-term rights to intellectual property of third
parties, as well as the capitalization of product development costs relating to
internally developed products.  The


increase period over period is
primarily due to new agreements with DreamWorks Animation SKG, Marvel
Enterprises, and Hasbro Properties Group, all of which were signed in fiscal
2006. We expect that we will continue to make significant expenditures relating
to our investment in software development and intellectual property
licenses.  Our future cash commitments
relating to these investments are detailed below in “Commitments.”  Cash flows from operations are affected by
our ability to release highly successful or “hit” titles.  Though many of these titles have substantial
production or acquisition costs and marketing expenditures, once a title
recoups these costs, incremental net revenues typically will directly and
positively impact cash flows.

For the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, cash flows from operating
activities were $86.0 million and $215.3 million, respectively.  The principal components comprising cash
flows from operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2006, included

favorable operating results and collection of accounts receivable partially
offset by investment in software development and intellectual property
licenses.  See an analysis of the change
in key balance sheet accounts below in “Key Balance Sheet Accounts.”  We expect that a primary source of future
liquidity, both short-term and long-term, will be the result of cash flows from
continuing operations.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

The primary source of cash used in investing activities typically have
included capital expenditures, acquisitions of privately held interactive
software development companies, and the net effect of purchases and
sales/maturities of short-term investment vehicles.  The goal of our short-term investments is to
maximize return while minimizing risk, maintaining liquidity, coordinating with
anticipated working capital needs, and providing for prudent investment
diversification.

For the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, cash flows used in
investing activities were $85.8 million and $143.9 million, respectively.  For the year ended March 31, 2006, cash flows
used in investing activities were primarily the result of capital expenditures,
the increase in short-term investments, and business acquisitions. We have
historically financed our acquisitions through the issuance of shares of common
stock or a combination of common stock and cash. We will continue to evaluate
potential acquisition candidates as to the benefit they bring to us.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

The primary source of cash provided by financing activities have
related to transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of
shares of common stock to employees and the public, and the purchase of
treasury shares.  We have not utilized
debt financing as a significant source of cash flows.  However, we do have available at certain of
our international locations, credit facilities, which are described below in “Credit
Facilities,” that can be utilized if needed.

For the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, cash flows from financing
activities were $45.1 million and $72.7 million, respectively.  The cash provided by financing activities for
the year ended March 31, 2006 was the result of the

issuance of common stock related to employee
stock option and stock purchase plans.  During
fiscal 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a buyback program under which we
can repurchase up to $350.0 million of our common stock. Under the program,
shares may be purchased as determined by management and within certain
guidelines, from time to time, in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions, including privately negotiated structured stock repurchase
transactions and through transactions in the options markets. Depending on
market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or
suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice.   In the past, we have entered into structured
stock repurchase transactions that were settled in cash or stock based on the
market price of our common stock on the date of the settlement. Upon
settlement, we either had our capital investment returned with a premium or
received shares of our common stock, depending, respectively, on whether the
market price of our common stock was above or below a pre-determined price
agreed in connection with each such transaction.  As of March 31, 2006, we had approximately
$226.2 million available for utilization under the buyback program and no
outstanding structured stock repurchase transactions.  We actively manage our capital structure as a
component of our overall business strategy. 
Accordingly, in the future, when we determine that market conditions are
appropriate, we may seek to achieve long term value for the shareholders
through, among other things, new debt or equity financings or refinancings,
share repurchases, and other transactions involving our equity or debt
securities.


Key Balance
Sheet Accounts

Accounts Receivable

The decrease in gross accounts receivable was
primarily the result of:

•

Late fourth quarter fiscal 2005 North
American releases of

THUG 2 Remix

and

Spider-Man

for the PSP.  Both titles were released concurrently with
the release of the PSP platform in late March 2005.  There were no corresponding new releases in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.

•

The fourth quarter fiscal 2005 releases of
three affiliate titles,

Mercenaries, Star
Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II,

and

Star Wars: Republic Commando

, in our European territories.   There was only one affiliate title released
in our European territories in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, LucasArts’

Star Wars: Empire at War,

which was only
released on PC.

Reserves for returns, price protection and
bad debt increased from $69.2 million at March 31, 2005 to $98.3 million at
March 31, 2006 while reserves as a percentage of gross receivables increased
from 39% to 77%.  This increase

was
largely due to increased reserves for returns and price protections related to
weak market conditions and the uncertainty involved in the ongoing console
transition.  Reserves for returns and
price protection are a function of the number of units and pricing of titles in
retail inventory (see description of Allowances for Returns, Price Protection,
Doubtful Accounts, and Inventory Obsolescence in Item 7: Critical Accounting Policies).

Inventories

Inventories have increased as a result of lower than expected
performance on certain fiscal 2006 third quarter title releases.  Uncertainties in the marketplace due to the
current console transition cycle as well as changes in retailer buying patterns
led to a buildup in inventories at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006,
primarily in our Publishing business segment. 
As a result of the buildup in inventory levels, for the year ended March
31, 2006 we had write-downs of inventory costs for certain titles in the amount
of $14.5 million, as w

e anticipate that certain titles in our current inventory will be sold
below its original cost.

Software Development

The decrease in software development was
primarily the result of more titles in development at March 31, 2005 to support
our fiscal 2006 title slate which was the largest in our history.  As we plan a more focused title slate in
fiscal 2007 due to the market uncertainty involved in the console transition,
we have fewer titles in development than at the end of fiscal 2005.


Intellectual Property Licenses

The increase in intellectual property
licenses was primarily the result of

continued investment in
intellectual property licenses totaling $82.3 million year-to-date.  In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we
further extended our exclusive licensing agreement with Marvel Enterprises by
signing a multi-year extension to our current video game licensing agreement
for the Spider-Man and X-Men franchises. 
This agreement grants us the exclusive rights to develop and publish
video games based on Marvel’s comic book franchises Spider-Man and X-Men.   We also signed an agreement with Spider-Man
Merchandising LP in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, to extend our exclusive
worldwide rights to publish entertainment software products based on movie
sequels subsequent to Spider-Man 3 or new television series to be produced
based upon certain Marvel characters through 2017.  Additionally, in our third quarter of fiscal
2006 we signed a multi-year agreement with DreamWorks Animation SKG which
extended our exclusive video game rights to future films in the “Shrek”
franchise beyond “Shrek the Third,” as well as titles based on several other
films currently planned or in development. 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we signed an agreement with Hasbro
Properties Group granting us the global rights, excluding Japan, to develop
console, hand-held, and PC games based on Hasbro’s “Transformers” brand.

Accounts
Payable

The decrease in accounts payable was
primarily the result of a high level of payables at March 31, 2005 related to
inventory purchases by our publishing business as a result of the release of

Doom 3

for the Xbox
in April 2005.   There were no new
releases early in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.

Accrued
Expenses

The increase in accrued expenses was primarily driven by increased
payroll accruals and separation and severance costs associated with a less than
7% reduction in workforce in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, increased
accruals for legal costs, and increased co-op marketing support. The increase
was partially offset by a reduced liability due to third parties on affiliate
titles distributed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.

Credit Facilities

We have revolving credit facilities with our Centresoft subsidiary
located in the UK (the “UK Facility”) and our NBG subsidiary located in Germany
(the “German Facility”).  The UK Facility
provided Centresoft with the ability to borrow up to GBP 12.0 million ($21.0
million), including issuing letters of credit, on a revolving basis as of March
31, 2006. Furthermore, under the UK Facility, Centresoft provided a GBP 0.6
million ($1.0 million) guarantee for the benefit of our CD Contact subsidiary
as of March 31, 2006.  The UK Facility
bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.0% as of March 31, 2006, is collateralized by
substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and expires in January
2007.  The UK Facility also contains
various covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial
ratios related to, among others, fixed charges. 
As of March 31, 2006, we were in compliance with these covenants.  No borrowings were outstanding against the UK
Facility as of March 31, 2006.  The
German Facility provided for revolving loans up to EUR 0.5 million ($0.6
million) as of March 31, 2006, bore interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus


2.5%, is collateralized by
certain of the subsidiary’s property and equipment and has no expiration
date.  No borrowings were outstanding
against the German Facility as of March 31, 2006.

As of March 31, 2006, we maintained a $7.5 million irrevocable standby
letter of credit.  The standby letter of
credit is required by one of our inventory manufacturers to qualify for payment
terms on our inventory purchases.  Under
the terms of this arrangement, we are required to maintain on deposit with the
bank a compensating balance, restricted as to use, of not less than the sum of
the available amount of the letter of credit plus the aggregate amount of any
drawings under the letter of credit that have been honored thereunder but not
reimbursed.  At March 31, 2006, the $7.5
million deposit is included in short-term investments as restricted cash.

As of March 31, 2006, our publishing subsidiary located in the UK
maintained a EUR 2.5 million ($3.0 million) irrevocable standby letter of
credit.  The standby letter of credit is
required by one of our inventory manufacturers to qualify for payment terms on
our inventory purchases.  The standby
letter of credit does not require a compensating balance and is collateralized
by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and expires in July
2006.  As of March 31, 2006, we had EUR
1.0 million ($1.2 million) of outstanding amounts against this letter of
credit.

Commitments

In the
normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third
parties for non-cancelable operating lease agreements for our offices, for the
development of products, as well as for the rights to intellectual
property.  Under these agreements, we
commit to provide specified payments to a lessor, developer, or intellectual
property holder, based upon contractual arrangements.  Typically, the payments to third-party
developers are conditioned upon the achievement by the developers of
contractually specified development milestones. 
These payments to third-party developers and intellectual property
holders typically are deemed to be advances and are recoupable against future
royalties earned by the developer or intellectual property holder based on the
sale of the related game. Additionally, in

connection with certain
intellectual property right acquisitions and development agreements, we will
commit to spend specified amounts for marketing support for the related game(s)
which is to be developed or in which the intellectual property will be
utilized.  Additionally, we lease certain
of our facitilites and equipment under non-cancelable operating lease
agreements.  Assuming all contractual
provisions are met, the total future minimum commitments for these and other
contractual arrangements in place as of March 31, 2006, are scheduled to be
paid as follows (amounts in thousands):

As of
March 31, 2006 and 2005, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated
entities or financial parties, such as entities often referred to as structured
finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the
purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually
narrow or limited purposes.  As such, we
are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could
arise if we had engaged in such relationships.

Related
Parties

From
August 2001 until September 2005, one of the members of our Board of Directors
was an individual who is a partner in a law firm that has provided legal
services to Activision for more than ten years. 
For the years


ended March 31, 2005 and 2004,
the years presented in this Annual Report for which that person was a member of
the Board of Directors, the fees we paid to the law firm were an insignificant
portion of the law firm’s total revenues. 
We believe that the fees charged to us by the law firm were competitive
with the fees charged by other law firms.

Financial Disclosure

We
maintain internal controls over financial reporting, which generally include
those controls relating to the preparation of our financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.  We also are focused on our “disclosure
controls and procedures,” which as defined by the Securities and Exchange
Commission are generally those controls and procedures designed to ensure that
financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms,
and that such information is communicated to management, including our Chief
Executive Officers and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our Disclosure
Committee, which operates under the Board approved Disclosure Committee Charter
and Disclosure Controls & Procedures Policy, includes senior management
representatives and assists executive management in its oversight of the
accuracy and timeliness of our disclosures, as well as in implementing and
evaluating our overall disclosure process. 
As part of our disclosure process, senior finance and operational
representatives from all of our corporate divisions and business units prepare
quarterly reports regarding their current quarter operational performance,
future trends, subsequent events, internal controls, changes in internal
controls, and other accounting and disclosure-relevant information.  These quarterly reports are reviewed by
certain key corporate finance representatives. 
These corporate finance representatives also conduct quarterly
interviews on a rotating basis with the preparers of selected quarterly
reports. The results of the quarterly reports and related interviews are
reviewed by the Disclosure Committee. 
Finance representatives also conduct reviews with our senior management
team, our internal and external counsel, and other appropriate personnel
involved in the disclosure process, as appropriate. Additionally, senior finance
and operational representatives provide internal certifications regarding the
accuracy of information they provide that is utilized in the preparation of our
periodic public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Financial results and other financial
information also are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors on a quarterly basis.  As
required by applicable regulatory requirements, the Chief Executive Officers
and the Chief Financial Officer review and make various certifications
regarding the accuracy of our periodic public reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, our disclosure controls and procedures, and our
internal control over financial reporting. 
With the assistance of the Disclosure Committee, we will continue to
assess and monitor our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal
controls over financial reporting, and will make refinements as necessary.

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards and Laws

On December
16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB
Statement No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based
Payment

(“SFAS No. 123R”), which is a revision of FASB Statement No.
123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
(“

SFAS No. 123”).  SFAS No.
123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees

, and amends FASB Statement No. 95,

Statement of Cash Flows

.  Generally,
the approach in SFAS No. 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS No.
123.  However, SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the
income statement based on their fair values.  Pro forma disclosure is no
longer an alternative.

SFAS
No. 123R permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two
methods:

•

A “modified prospective” method in which
compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on
the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share-based payments granted after
the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all
awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R that
remain unvested on the effective date.

•

A “modified retrospective” method which
includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above,
but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized
under SFAS 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) all prior
periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of adoption.


As permitted by SFAS No. 123, prior to April 1, 2006 we accounted for
share-based payments to employees using APB No. 25’s intrinsic value method
and, as such, generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock
options.  Accordingly, the adoption of the SFAS No. 123R fair value method
will have a significant impact on our results of operations, although it will
have no impact on our overall financial position.  We adopted SFAS
No. 123R on April 1, 2006 using the “modified prospective” approach.

We currently believe that the
expensing of stock-based compensation will have an impact on our Consolidated
Statement of Operations similar to our pro-forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123
and expect an impact in fiscal 2007 of approximately $0.05 per share.

On
November 24, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151,

Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter

(“SFAS No. 151”). The standard requires that abnormal amounts of
idle capacity and spoilage costs within inventory should be excluded from the
cost of inventory and expensed when incurred. 
The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are applicable to inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005.  We expect the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will
not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

On
December 15, 2004 the FASB issued Statement No. 153 (“SFAS No. 153”),

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets

—

an Amendment of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 29

.

This standard requires exchanges
of productive assets to be accounted for at fair value, rather than at
carryover basis, unless (1) neither the asset received nor the asset
surrendered has a fair value that is determinable within reasonable limits or
(2) the transactions lack commercial substance. The new standard is effective
for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2005.  The adoption of SFAS No.
153 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of
operations.

In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement No. 154 (“SFAS No. 154”),

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections – A
Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3

.   SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements
for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle and
correction of errors. Under previous guidance, changes in accounting principle
were recognized as a cumulative effect in the net income of the period of the
change. The new statement requires retrospective application of changes in
accounting principle and correction of errors, limited to the direct effects of
the change, to prior periods’ financial statements, unless it is impracticable
to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the
change.  SFAS No. 154 is effective
for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005. In the event that we have an accounting change or
an error correction, SFAS No. 154 could have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

On February 16, 2006, the
FASB issued Statement No. 155 (“SFAS No. 155”),

Accounting
for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments – An amendment of FASB Statements No.
133 and 140.

SFAS No. 155
amends FASB Statements No. 133,

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

and No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial
Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

to resolve issues addressed in Statement 133 Implementation
Issue No. D1, “Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in
Securitized Financial Assets.” SFAS No. 155 permits fair value remeasurement
for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that
otherwise would require bifurcation; clarifies which interest-only strips and
principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of Statement 133;
establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets
to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid
financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring
bifurcation; clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of
subordination are not embedded derivatives; and amends Statement 140 to
eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a
derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other
than another derivative financial instrument. 
SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued
after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after
September 15, 2006.  We do not expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 155 to have a material effect on our financial position or
results of operations.

On
March 17, 2006,

the FASB
issued Statement No. 156 (“SFAS No. 156”),

Accounting for Servicing
of Financial Assets – an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140.

SFAS No. 156 amends Statement No.
140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing
of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,

with respect
to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing
liabilities. SFAS No. 156 requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or
servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a
financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in certain situations;
requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities
to be initially measured at fair value, if practicable; permits either the

amortization method

or the

fair value
measurement method,

as
subsequent measurement methods for each class of separately recognized
servicing assets and servicing liabilities; permits a one-time reclassification
of available-for-sale securities to trading securities by entities with
recognized servicing rights; and requires separate presentation of servicing
assets and servicing liabilities


subsequently measured at fair
value in the statement of financial position and additional disclosures for all
separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities.  SFAS No. 156 is effective in the first fiscal
year that begins after September 15, 2006. 
We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 156 to have a material effect
on our financial position or results of operations.

On October 22, 2004, the President of the
United States signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) which
contains a number of tax law modifications with accounting implications.  For companies that pay U.S. income taxes on
manufacturing activities in the U.S., the Act provides a deduction from taxable
income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified income from domestic
production activities.  The manufacturing
deduction provided by the Act replaces the extraterritorial income (“ETI”)
deduction currently in place.  We
currently derive benefits from the ETI exclusion which was repealed by the
Act.  Our exclusion for fiscal 2006 and
2007 will be limited to 75% and 45% of the otherwise allowable exclusion and no
exclusion will be available in fiscal 2008 and thereafter.  The Act also creates a temporary incentive
for U.S. multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by
providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled
foreign corporations (“Homeland Investment Act”). The deduction is subject to a
number of limitations. The Act also provides for other changes in tax law that
will affect a variety of taxpayers.  On
December 21, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued two
FASB Staff Positions (“FSP”) regarding the accounting implications of the Act
related to (1) the deduction for qualified domestic production activities and
(2) the one-time tax benefit for the repatriation of foreign earnings. The FASB
determined that the deduction for qualified domestic production activities
should be accounted for as a special deduction under FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

.  The FASB also confirmed, that upon deciding
that some amount of earnings will be repatriated, a company must record in that
period the associated tax liability.  The
guidance in the FSPs apply to financial statements for periods ending after the
date the Act was enacted.

We have evaluated the Act and have concluded
that we will not repatriate foreign earnings under the Homeland Investment Act
Provisions.

Inflation

Our management
currently believes that inflation has not had a material impact on continuing
operations.


Item 7A. 
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is
the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices.  Our market risk exposures primarily include
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and market
prices.  Our market risk sensitive
instruments are classified as instruments entered into for purposes “other than
trading.”  Our views on market risk are
not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent
the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur, since actual gains and
losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, market prices, and the timing
of transactions.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to our investment portfolio. 
We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment
portfolio.  We manage our interest rate
risk by maintaining an investment portfolio consisting primarily of debt
instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average
maturities.  We also manage our interest
rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that
we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity.  As of March 31, 2006, our cash equivalents
and short-term investments included debt securities of $666.3 million.

The following table presents the amounts and related weighted average
interest rates of our investment portfolio as of March 31, 2006 (amounts in
thousands):

Our short-term
investments generally mature between three months and thirty months.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We transact
business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial
market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
particularly EUR, GBP, and AUD. The volatility of EUR, GBP, and AUD (and all
other applicable currencies) will be monitored frequently throughout the coming
year.  When appropriate, we enter into
hedging transactions in order to mitigate our risk from foreign currency
fluctuations. We will continue to use hedging programs in the future and may
use currency forward contracts, currency options, and/or other derivative
financial instruments commonly utilized to reduce financial market risks if it
is determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk.  We do not hold or purchase any foreign
currency contracts for trading purposes.  
As of March 31, 2006, we had no outstanding hedging contracts.

Market Price Risk

With regard to the structured stock repurchase transactions described
in Note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at those
times when we have structured stock repurchase transactions outstanding, it is
possible that at settlement we could take delivery of shares at an effective
repurchase price higher than the then market price.  As of March 31, 2006, we had no structured
stock repurchase transactions outstanding.

Item 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

The Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to reasonably assure that
(i) information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and (ii) information is accumulated and
communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officers and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures.  A control system, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to
disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our
periodic reports.  Inherent limitations
to any system of disclosure controls and procedures include, but are not
limited to, the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding
of such controls by one or more persons. 
In addition, we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions,
which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, and our
system of controls may therefore not achieve its desired purposes under all
possible future events.

The Company’s
management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officers and Chief
Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report.  Based on this controls
evaluation, and subject to the limitations described above, the Chief Executive
Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of
the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis.


Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

There was no change in our internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act.  Under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive
Officers and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on
criteria established in the framework in

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
Based on this evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that its
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2006.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm has audited management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2006 as stated in their report on pages F-1
and F-2.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Activision, Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits of Activision, Inc.’s 2006 and 2005
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2006

and an audit of its 2004

consolidated

financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based
on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
index appearing under Item 8, present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Activision, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at
March 31, 2006 and 2005 and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2006 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.  In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
listed in the index appearing under Item 8, presents

fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated

financial
statements.  These financial statements and financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule

based on our audits.
 We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board

(United States).  Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

F-1

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A,
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of March 31, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, based
on criteria established in

Internal Control
- - Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.  The Company’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on
management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of
internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects.  An audit of internal control over financial
reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.  We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Activision, Inc. (“Activision,” the “Company,”
or “we”) is a leading international publisher of interactive entertainment
software products. We have built a company with a diverse portfolio of products
that spans a wide range of categories and target markets and that is used on a
variety of game hardware platforms and operating systems. We have created,
licensed, and acquired a group of highly recognizable brands, which we market
to a variety of consumer demographics. Our products cover diverse game
categories including action/adventure, action sports, racing, role-playing,
simulation, first-person action, and strategy. Our target customer base ranges
from casual players to game enthusiasts, children to adults, and mass-market
consumers to “value” buyers. We currently offer our products primarily in
versions that operate on the Sony PlayStation 2 (“PS2”), Nintendo GameCube (“GameCube”),
Microsoft Xbox (“Xbox”), and Microsoft Xbox 360 (“Xbox360”) console systems,
Nintendo Game Boy Advance (“GBA”), Sony PlayStation Portable (“PSP”), and
Nintendo Dual Screen (“NDS”) hand-held devices, and the personal computer (“PC”).
In prior years, we have also offered our products on the Sony PlayStation (“PS1”)
and Nintendo 64 (“N64”) console systems, and the Nintendo Game Boy Color (“GBC”)
hand-held device. We are also in the process of developing titles for the
next-generation console systems being developed by Sony and Nintendo, the
PlayStation 3 (“PS3”) and the Wii, respectively.

Our publishing
business involves the development, marketing, and sale of products directly, by
license, or through our affiliate label program with certain third-party
publishers. Our distribution business consists of operations in Europe that
provide logistical and sales services to third-party publishers of interactive
entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of
interactive entertainment hardware.

We maintain
operations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom (“UK”), Germany,
France, Italy, Spain, Japan, Australia, Sweden, and the Netherlands. In fiscal
year 2006, international operations contributed approximately 52% of
consolidated net revenues.

Principles of
Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Activision, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash, Cash
Equivalents, and Short-term Investments

Cash and cash equivalents include cash, money
markets, and short-term investments with original maturities of not more than 90
days.

Short-term
investments generally mature between three and thirty months. Investments with
maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their
liquid nature and because such securities represent the investment of cash that
is available for current operations. All of our short-term investments are
classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair market value with
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) reported as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity. The specific
identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed with
realized gains and losses reflected in investment income, net.

Restricted Cash – Compensating Balances

As of March
31, 2006, we maintained a $7.5 million irrevocable standby letter of credit. The
standby letter of credit is required by one of our inventory manufacturers to
qualify for payment terms on our inventory purchases. Under the terms of this
arrangement, we are required to maintain on deposit with the bank a
compensating balance, restricted as to use, of not less than the sum of the
available amount of the letter of credit plus the aggregate amount of any
drawings under the letter of credit that have been honored thereunder but not
reimbursed. At March 31, 2006, the $7.5 million deposit is included in
short-term investments as restricted cash.

F-7

Concentration of
Credit Risk

Financial
instruments which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk
consist principally of temporary cash investments and accounts receivable. We
place our temporary cash investments with financial institutions. At various
times during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, we had deposits in
excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limit at these
financial institutions.

Our customer
base includes retail outlets and distributors, including mass-market retailers,
consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game specialty stores in
the United States and countries worldwide. We perform ongoing credit
evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit
losses. We generally do not require collateral or other security from our
customers.

We had
two customers, Wal-Mart and GameStop, that accounted for 22% and 10% of
consolidated net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2006 and 43% and 4% of
consolidated gross accounts receivable at March 31, 2006. These customers were
customers of both our publishing and distribution businesses. As of and for the
years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, our largest customer, Wal-Mart, accounted
for 23% and 20%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues and 33% of
consolidated gross accounts receivable in both periods.

Financial
Instruments

The estimated
fair values of financial instruments have been determined using available
market information and valuation methodologies described below. However,
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein may not be
indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. The
use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material
effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

The carrying
amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. Short-term
investments are carried at fair value with fair values being estimated based on
quoted market prices.

We account for
derivative instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and
Certain Hedging Activities, an amendment of SFAS No. 133” and SFAS No. 149, “Amendment
of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No.
133, 138, and 149 require that all derivatives, including foreign exchange
contracts, be recognized in the balance sheet in other current assets or
accrued expenses at their fair value.

We utilize
forward contracts in order to reduce financial market risks. These instruments
are used to hedge foreign currency exposures of underlying assets or
liabilities. Our accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether
they meet the criteria for designation as hedging transactions. Changes in fair
value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, are highly
effective, and qualify as hedging instruments, are recorded in other
comprehensive income until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings
within the financial statement line item consistent with the hedged item. Any
ineffective portion of a derivative change in fair value is immediately
recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives that do not
qualify as hedging instruments are recorded in earnings. The fair value of
foreign currency contracts is estimated based on the spot rate of the various
hedged currencies as of the end of the period. As of March 31, 2006 and 2005,
we had no outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts.

Equity Investments

From time to
time, we may make a capital investment and hold a minority interest in a
third-party developer in connection with entertainment software products to be
developed by such developer for us. We account for those capital investments
over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence using the
equity method. For those investments over which we do not have the ability to
exercise significant influence, we account for our investment using the cost
method.

F-8

Software

Development

Costs

Software development costs
include payments made to independent software developers under development
agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for internally developed products.

We account for software
development costs in accordance with SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.”  Software development costs are capitalized
once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are
determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product
encompasses both technical design documentation and game design documentation. For
products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the
development cycle. Technological feasibility is evaluated on a product-by-product
basis. Prior to a product’s release, we expense, as part of cost of sales —
software royalties and amortization, capitalized costs when we believe such
amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized costs for those products that are
cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period
of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not
capitalized are charged immediately to product development expense. We evaluate
the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis. The recoverability of capitalized software
development costs is evaluated based on the expected performance of the
specific products for which the costs relate. Criteria used to evaluate
expected product performance include: 
historical performance of comparable products using comparable
technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and estimated
performance of a sequel product based on the performance of the product on
which the sequel is based.

Commencing upon product release,
capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of sales —
software royalties and amortization based on the ratio of current revenues to
total projected revenues, generally resulting in an amortization period of six
months or less. For products that have been released in prior periods, we
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.
The primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance.

Significant

management judgments and estimates are utilized
in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established, as well as
in the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs. In
evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected
product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of
additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales
are less than and/or revised forecasted or actual costs are greater than the
original forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis,
the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given
quarter, which could result in an impairment charge.

Intellectual
Property Licenses

Intellectual property license
costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for
use of their trademarks,

copyrights

, software, technology, or other intellectual property or proprietary
rights in the development of our products. Depending upon the agreement with
the rights holder, we may obtain the rights to use acquired intellectual
property in multiple products over multiple years, or alternatively, for a
single product.

We evaluate the future
recoverability of capitalized intellectual property licenses on a quarterly
basis. The recoverability of

capitalized

intellectual property license costs is evaluated based on the expected
performance of the specific products in which the licensed trademark or
copyright is to be used. As many of our intellectual property licenses extend
for multiple products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of
capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative
factors such as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles
utilizing the intellectual property, whether there are any future planned
theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property,
and the rights holder’s continued promotion and exploitation of the
intellectual property. Prior to the related product’s release, we expense, as part
of cost of sales — intellectual property licenses, capitalized intellectual
property costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized
intellectual property costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned
are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation. Criteria
used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance
of comparable products using comparable technology; orders for the product
prior to its release; and estimated performance of a sequel product based on
the performance of the product on which the sequel is based.

F-9

Commencing upon the related
product’s release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized
to cost of sales — intellectual property licenses based on the ratio of current
revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products
in which the licensed property will be utilized. As intellectual property
license contracts may extend for multiple years, the amortization of
capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may
extend beyond one year. For intellectual property included in products that
have been released and unreleased products, we evaluate the future
recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis. The primary
evaluation criterion is actual title performance.

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the
recoverability of capitalized costs.

In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance
utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be
incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than, and/or
revised forecasted or actual costs are greater than, the original forecasted
amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable
value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could
result in an impairment charge. Additionally, as noted above, as many of our
intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple
years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property
license costs based on certain qualitative factors such as the success of other
products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property,
whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series
based on the intellectual property and the rights holder’s continued promotion
and exploitation of the intellectual property. Material differences may result
in the amount and timing of charges for any period if management makes
different judgments or utilizes different estimates in evaluating these
qualitative factors.

Inventories

Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.

Property and
Equipment

Property and
equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided
using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives
or the lease term:  buildings, 25 to 33
years; computer equipment, office furniture and other equipment, 2 to 5 years;
leasehold improvements, through the life of the lease. When assets are retired
or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed and
any resulting gains or losses are recognized in current operations.

Goodwill

We account for
goodwill using the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles.”  SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting
and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Under
SFAS No. 142, goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and should
not be amortized but rather tested at least annually for impairment. An
impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of goodwill is not
recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Our impairment
tests as of March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 did not indicate that goodwill was
impaired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we have not amortized goodwill
during the years ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004.

R

evenue Recognition

We recognize revenue from the
sale of our products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our
customers. Certain products are sold to customers with a street date (the date
that products are made widely available for sale by retailers). For these
products we recognize revenue no earlier than the street date. Revenue from
product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns
and price protection. With respect to license agreements that provide customers
the right to make multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenue
is recognized upon delivery of such copies. Per copy royalties on sales that
exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned. In addition, in order to
recognize revenue for both product sales and licensing transactions, persuasive
evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection of the related receivable
must be probable. Revenue recognition also determines the timing of certain
expenses, including cost of sales — intellectual property licenses and cost of
sales — software royalties and amortization.

F-10

Sales
incentives or other consideration given by us to our customers is accounted for
in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Emerging Issues
Task Force (“EITF”) Issue 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor
to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products).”  In accordance with EITF Issue 01-9, sales
incentives and other consideration that are considered adjustments of the
selling price of our products, such as rebates and product placement fees, are
reflected as reductions of revenue. Sales incentives and other consideration
that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received, such as
the appearance of our products in a customer’s national circular ad, are
reflected as sales and marketing expenses.

Allowances
for Returns, Price Protection, Doubtful Accounts, and Inventory Obsolescence

In determining the
appropriate unit shipments to our customers, we benchmark our titles using
historical and industry data. We
closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles,
the performance of products released by other publishers, and the anticipated
timing of other releases in order to assess future demands of current and
upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and
subsequent reorders are evaluated to ensure that quantities are sufficient to
meet the demands from the retail markets but at the same time, are controlled
to prevent excess inventory in the channel.

We may permit product returns
from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In
general, price protection refers to the circumstances when we elect to decrease
the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and
applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to Activision
with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers must
meet to be granted the right to return products or price protection are, among
other things, compliance with applicable payment terms, delivery to us of
weekly inventory and sell-through reports, and consistent participation in the
launches of our premium title releases. We may also consider other factors,
including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market factors. Management
must make estimates of potential future product returns and price protection
related to current period product revenue. We estimate the amount of future
returns and price protection for current period product revenue utilizing
historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand
and acceptance of our products by the end consumer. The following factors are
used to estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for a
particular title: historical performance of titles in similar genres, historical
performance of the hardware platform, historical performance of the brand,
console hardware life cycle, Activision sales force and retail customer
feedback, industry pricing, weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory, absolute
quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory, our warehouse on-hand inventory
levels, the title’s recent sell-through history (if available), marketing trade
programs, and competing titles. The relative importance of these factors varies
among titles depending upon, among other items, genre, platform, seasonality,
and sales strategy. Significant management judgments and estimates must be made
and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price
protection in any accounting period. Based upon historical experience we
believe our estimates are reasonable. However, actual returns and price
protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a number
of reasons including, among others, a lack of consumer acceptance of a title,
the release in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor, or
technological obsolescence due to the emergence of new hardware platforms. Material
differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period
if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in
determining the allowances for returns and price protection. For example, a 1%
change in our March 31, 2006 allowance for returns and price protection would
impact net revenues by $1.0 million.

Similarly, management must
make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable. In
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze the age of current
outstanding account balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations,
customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes in our
customers’ payment terms and their economic condition, as well as whether we
can obtain sufficient credit insurance. Any significant changes in any of these
criteria would impact management’s estimates in establishing our allowance for
doubtful accounts.

We value inventory at the
lower of cost or market. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and
in the retail channel and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory
based on the future expected demand for our products. Significant changes in
demand for our products would impact management’s estimates in establishing our
inventory provision.

F-11

Shipping and
Handling

Shipping and
handling costs, which consist primarily of packaging and transportation charges
incurred to move finished goods to customers, are included in cost of sales –
product costs.

Advertising
Expenses

We expense
advertising as incurred, except for production costs associated with media
advertising which are deferred and charged to expense the first time the
related ad is run. Advertising expenses for the years ended March 31, 2006,
2005, and 2004 were approximately $192.6 million, $150.7 million, and $76.6
million, respectively, and are included in sales and marketing expense in the
consolidated statements of operations.

Investment Income,
Net

Investment
income, net is comprised of the following, (amounts in thousands):

Income Taxes

We account for
income taxes using SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”  Under SFAS No. 109, income taxes are
accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Foreign Currency
Translation

The functional
currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are their local currencies. All assets
and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at
the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period, and revenue and expenses
are translated at weighted average exchange rates during the period. The
resulting translation adjustments are reflected as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.

Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive
income includes net income, unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on
short-term investments, foreign currency translation adjustments, and, if
applicable, the effective portion of gains or losses on cash flow hedges that
are presented as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
in shareholders’ equity.

Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities or the disclosure of gain or loss contingencies at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

F-12

Earnings Per
Common Share

Basic earnings
per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for all periods. Diluted
earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding,
increased by common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents are calculated
using the treasury stock method and represent incremental shares issuable upon
exercise of our outstanding options and warrants and, if applicable in the
period, conversion of our convertible debt. However, potential common shares
are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share
calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a
period in which a net loss is recorded.

Stock-Based
Compensation and Pro Forma Information

Under SFAS No.
123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” compensation expense is recorded
for the issuance of stock options and other stock-based compensation in
accordance with either the fair value method specified in SFAS No. 123 or in
accordance with the intrinsic value method specified in Accounting Principles
Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” Under
the intrinsic value method, compensation expense is recorded on the date of
grant or measurement date only if the current market price of the underlying
stock exceeds the stock option or other stock-based compensation exercise price.
If the grant date stock price exceeds the strike price, then the intrinsic
value is equal to the positive difference between these two values. At March
31, 2006, we awarded several stock-based employee compensation plans, which are
described more fully in Note 14. We account for those plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25 and related
Interpretations. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and
earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation (in thousands, except per
share data):

For disclosure
purposes, prior to April 1, 2005, the fair value of options granted was
estimated at the date of grant using the Modified Black-Scholes option pricing
model as specified in SFAS 123. As of April 1, 2005, we switched to a
binomial-lattice model to estimate the fair value of options granted from that
date forward. The fair value of options granted in the years ended March 31,
2006, 2005, and 2004 has been estimated at the date of grant using the
following weighted average assumptions:

F-13

Both the
binomial-lattice model and the Black-Scholes option pricing model require the
input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility. T

o
estimate volatility for the binomial-lattice model, we use methods or
capabilities that are discussed in FAS 123R (“Statement no. 123(R), Share-Based
Payment”). These methods included the
implied volatility method based upon the volatilities for exchange-traded
options on our stock to estimate short-term volatility, the historical method
(annualized standard deviation of the instantaneous returns on Activision’s
stock) to estimate long-term volatility and a statistical model to estimate the
transition or “mean reversion” from short-term volatility to long-term
volatility. Based on these methods, for options granted during the
quarters in the year ended March 31, 2006, the expected stock price volatility
ranged from 40% to 55%, with a weighted average volatility of 48% for options
granted during the quarters in the year ended March 31, 2006. For the
Black-Scholes option pricing model used for options granted in each of the
quarters in the year ended March 31, 2005, the historical stock price
volatility used was based on weekly stock price observation, using an average
of the high and low stock prices of our common stock, which resulted in an
expected stock price volatility ranging from 45% to 48%. For purposes of the
above pro forma disclosure, the fair value of options granted is amortized to
stock-based employee compensation cost over the period(s) in which the related
employee services are rendered. Accordingly, the pro forma stock-based
compensation cost for any period will typically depend on options granted in
both the current period and prior periods.

For options
granted during fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, the per share weighted average fair
value of options with exercise prices equal to market value on the date of
grant was $4.90, $3.08, and $1.56, respectively. The per share weighted average
estimated fair value of Employee Stock Purchase Plan shares granted during the
years ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $3.11, $1.59, and $0.85,
respectively.

The effects on
pro forma disclosures of applying SFAS No. 123 may not be representative of the
effects on actual compensation expense of applying SFAS No. 123R in future
years.

Common stock
warrants are granted from time to time to non-employees in connection with the
development of software and acquisition of licensing rights for intellectual
property. In accordance with EITF No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments
that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring or in Connection With
Selling Goods or Services,” the fair value of common stock warrants granted is
determined as of the measurement date and is capitalized, expensed and
amortized consistent with our policies relating to software development and
intellectual property license costs.

Restricted
Stock

In June 2005,
we issued the rights to 155,763 shares of restricted stock to an employee. Additionally,
in October 2005 we issued the rights to 96,712 shares of restricted stock to an
employee. These shares vest over a five-year period and remain subject to
forfeiture if vesting conditions are not met. In accordance with APB No. 25, we
recognize unearned compensation in connection with the grant of restricted
shares equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. The
fair value of these shares when issued was approximately $12.84 and $15.51 per
share, respectively, and resulted in a total increase in “Additional paid-in
capital” and “Unearned compensation” on the accompanying balance sheet of $3.5
million. Over the vesting period, we reduce unearned compensation and recognize
compensation expense. For the year ended March 31, 2006, we recorded expense
related to these shares of approximately $467,000 in “General and
administrative” on the accompanying statements of operations.

Stock Splits

In April 2003,
the Board of Directors approved a three-for-two split of our outstanding common
shares effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. The split was paid on June
6, 2003 to shareholders of record as of May 16, 2003. In February 2004, the
Board of Directors approved a second three-for-two split of our outstanding
common shares effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. The split was paid
on March 15, 2004 to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2004. In
February 2005, the Board of Directors approved a four-for-three split of our
outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 33-1/3% stock dividend. The
split was paid March 22, 2005 to shareholders of record as of March 7, 2005. In
September 2005, the Board of Directors approved a four-for-three split of our
outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 33-1/3% stock dividend. The
split was paid October 24, 2005 to shareholders of record as of October 10,
2005. The par value of our common stock was maintained at the pre-split amount
of $.000001. The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, including
all share and per share data, have been restated as if the stock splits had
occurred as of the earliest period presented.

On March 7,
2005, in connection with our March 22, 2005 stock split, all shares of common
stock held as treasury stock were formally cancelled and restored to the status
of authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

3.

Acquisitions

During the
three years ended March 31, 2006, we separately completed the acquisition of
four privately held interactive software development companies. We accounted
for these acquisitions in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.”  SFAS No. 141 addresses financial accounting
and reporting for business combinations, requiring that the purchase method be
used to account and report for all business combinations. These acquisitions
have further enabled us to implement our multi-platform development strategy by
bolstering our internal product development capabilities for console systems
and personal computers and strengthening our position in the first-person
action, action/adventure, and action sports game categories. A significant
portion of the purchase price for all of these acquisitions was assigned to
goodwill as the primary asset we acquired in each of the transactions was an
assembled workforce with proven technical and design talent with a history of
high quality product creation. Pro forma consolidated statements of operations
for these acquisitions are not shown, as they would not differ materially from
reported results.

Auction rate
securities are securities that are structured with short-term reset dates of
generally less than 90 days but with maturities in excess of 90 days. At the
end of the reset period, investors can sell or continue to hold the securities
at par. These securities are classified in the table below based on their legal
stated maturity dates.

The following
table summarizes the final maturities of our investments in debt securities as
of March 31, 2006 (amounts in thousands):

For the year
ended March 31, 2006, net realized gains on investments consisted of $4.3
million of gross realized gains and no gross realized losses. For the year
ended March 31, 2005, net realized gains on investments consisted of $471,000
of gross realized gains and no gross realized losses. For the year ended March
31, 2004, net realized gains on investments consisted of $25,000 of gross
realized gains and $4,000 of gross realized losses.

F-17

In accordance with
EITF 03-1, “

The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,”

the
fair value of investments in an unrealized loss position for which an
other-than-temporary impairment has not been recognized was $672.4 million and
$508.2 million at March 31, 2006 and 2005, 
respectively, with related gross unrealized losses of $5.5 million and
$4.1 million, respectively. At March 31, 2006, the gross unrealized losses were
comprised mostly of unrealized losses on U.S. agency issues, corporate bonds,
and mortgage-backed securities with $3.9 million of unrealized loss being in a
continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or greater. At March 31,
2005, the gross unrealized losses were comprised mostly of unrealized losses on
corporate bonds, U.S. agency issues, and asset-back securities with $464,000 of
unrealized loss being in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve
months or greater.

The Company’s
investment portfolio usually consists of government and corporate securities
with effective maturities less than 30 months. The longer the term of the
securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market rates of
interest and yields on bonds. Investments are reviewed periodically to identify
possible impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews
factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been
below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company’s
ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be
sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. The Company has the intent
and ability to hold these securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient
for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to (or beyond) the initial cost of
the investment. The Company expects to realize the full value of all of these
investments upon maturity or sale.

development costs included $61.3 million of internally developed software costs
and $30.3 million of payments made to third-party software developers. Capitalized
intellectual property licenses were $87.0 million and $35.7 million as of March
31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Amortization and write-offs of capitalized
software development costs and intellectual property licenses, combined, was
$173.6 million, $134.8 million, and $87.9 million for the years ended March 31,
2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Amortization and write-offs of capitalized
software development costs and intellectual property licenses for the year
ended March 31, 2006 included p

roduct cancellation charges, exclusive of termination fees, of $10.3
million, impairment charges of $8.8 million, and recoverability write-offs of

Operations
by Reportable Segments and Geographic Area

We operate two
business segments: (i) publishing of interactive entertainment software and
(ii) distribution of interactive entertainment software and hardware products.

Publishing
refers to the development, marketing, and sale of products directly, by license
or through our affiliate label program with certain third-party publishers. In
the United States, we primarily sell our products on a direct basis to
mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and
game specialty stores. We conduct our international publishing activities
through offices in the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands,
Australia, Sweden, Canada, and Japan. Our products are sold internationally on
a direct-to-retail basis and through third-party distribution and licensing
arrangements and through our wholly-owned distribution subsidiaries located in
the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany.

Distribution
refers to our operations in the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany that provide
logistical and sales services to third-party publishers of interactive
entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of
interactive entertainment hardware.

Resources are
allocated to each of these segments using information on their respective net
revenues and operating profits before interest and taxes.

The accounting
policies of these segments are the same as those described in the Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies. Transactions between segments are eliminated
in consolidation.

A significant portion of our revenues is derived from products based on
a relatively small number of popular brands each year. In fiscal 2006, 30% of
our consolidated net revenues (38% of worldwide publishing net revenues) was
derived from three brands, which accounted for 14%, 8%, and 8% of consolidated
net revenues (18%, 10%, and 10% of worldwide publishing net revenues). In
fiscal 2005, 37% of our consolidated net revenues (48% of worldwide publishing
net revenues) was derived from three brands, which accounted for 16%, 11%, and
10% of consolidated net revenues (21%, 14%, and 13% of worldwide publishing net
revenues). In fiscal 2004, 35% of our consolidated net revenues (49% of
worldwide publishing net revenues) was derived from three brands, which
accounted for 17%, 14%, and 4% of consolidated net revenues (24%, 20%, and 5%

are as follows:

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. The components of the net deferred tax asset and
liability are as follows (amounts in thousands):

The tax
benefits associated with certain net operating loss carryovers relate to
employee stock options. Pursuant to SFAS No. 109, net operating losses do not
include $30.9 million relating to these items which will be credited to
additional paid-in capital when realized.

As of March
31, 2006, our available federal net operating loss carryforward of
approximately $87.7 million is subject to certain limitations as defined under
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforwards expire
between 2020 and 2024. We have various state net operating loss carryforwards

F-25

totaling $51.0
million which are not subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code. We have tax credit carryforwards of $43.7 million and $31.4
million for federal and state purposes, respectively, which begin to expire in
2008.

At March 31,
2006, our deferred income tax asset for tax credit carryforwards and net
operating loss carryforwards was reduced by a valuation allowance of $35.6
million as compared to $25.7 million in the prior fiscal year. Realization of
the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the continued generation of
sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of tax credits and loss
carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is
more likely than not that the net carrying value of the deferred tax asset will
be realized.

Cumulative
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have
been provided approximated $68.4 million at March 31, 2006. Deferred income
taxes on these earnings have not been provided as these amounts are considered
to be permanent in duration.

On October 22, 2004, the President of the United States signed the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) which contains a number of tax
law modifications with accounting implications. For companies that pay U.S.
income taxes on manufacturing activities in the U.S., the Act provides a
deduction from taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified
income from domestic production activities. The manufacturing deduction
provided by the Act replaces the extraterritorial income (“ETI”) deduction
currently in place. We currently derive benefits from the ETI exclusion which
was repealed by the Act. Our exclusion for fiscal 2006 and 2007 will be limited
to 75% and 45% of the otherwise allowable exclusion and no exclusion will be
available in fiscal 2008 and thereafter. The Act also creates a temporary
incentive for U.S. multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned
abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends
from controlled foreign corporations (“Homeland Investment Act”). The deduction
is subject to a number of limitations. The Act also provides for other changes
in tax law that will affect a variety of taxpayers. On December 21, 2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued two FASB Staff Positions (“FSP”)
regarding the accounting implications of the Act related to (1) the deduction
for qualified domestic production activities and (2) the one-time tax benefit
for the repatriation of foreign earnings. The FASB determined that the
deduction for qualified domestic production activities should be accounted for
as a special deduction under FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. The FASB also confirmed, that
upon deciding that some amount of earnings will be repatriated, a company must
record in that period the associated tax liability. The guidance in the FSPs
apply to financial statements for periods ending after the date the Act was
enacted.

We have
evaluated the Act and have concluded that we will not repatriate foreign
earnings under the Homeland Investment Act Provisions.

Commitments and Contingencies

Credit
Facilities

We have
revolving credit facilities with our Centresoft subsidiary located in the UK
(the “UK Facility”) and our NBG subsidiary located in Germany (the “German
Facility”). The UK Facility provided Centresoft with the ability to borrow up
to Great British Pounds (“GBP”) 12.0 million ($21.0 million) and GBP 8.0
million ($15.0 million), including issuing letters of credit, on a revolving
basis as of March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Furthermore, under the UK
Facility, Centresoft provided a GBP 0.6 million ($1.0 million) and a GBP 0.6
million ($1.1 million) guarantee for the benefit of our CD Contact subsidiary
as of March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The UK Facility bore interest at
LIBOR plus 2.0% as of March 31, 2006 and 2005, is collateralized by
substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and expires in January 2007. The
UK Facility also contains various covenants that require the subsidiary to
maintain specified financial ratios related to, among others, fixed charges. As
of March 31, 2006 and 2005, we were in compliance with these covenants. No
borrowings were outstanding against the UK Facility as of March 31, 2006 or
2005. The German Facility provided for revolving loans up to EUR 0.5 million
($0.6 million) as of both March 31, 2006 and 2005, bore interest at a
Eurocurrency rate plus 2.5%, is collateralized by certain of the subsidiary’s
property and equipment and has no expiration date. No borrowings were
outstanding against the German Facility as of March 31, 2006 or 2005.

F-26

As of March
31, 2006, we maintained a $7.5 million irrevocable standby letter of credit. As
of March 31, 2005, we did not maintain this standby letter of credit. The
standby letter of credit is required by one of our inventory manufacturers to
qualify for payment terms on our inventory purchases. Under the terms of this
arrangement, we are required to maintain on deposit with the bank a
compensating balance, restricted as to use, of not less than the sum of the
available amount of the letter of credit plus the aggregate amount of any
drawings under the letter of credit that have been honored thereunder but not
reimbursed. At March 31, 2006, the $7.5 million deposit is included in
short-term investments as restricted cash.

As of March
31, 2006, our publishing subsidiary located in the UK maintained a EUR 2.5
million ($3.0 million) irrevocable standby letter of credit. As of March 31,
2005, we did not maintain this standby letter of credit. The standby letter of
credit is required by one of our inventory manufacturers to qualify for payment
terms on our inventory purchases. The standby letter of credit does not require
a compensating balance and is collateralized by substantially all of the assets
of the subsidiary and expires in July 2006. As of March 31, 2006, we had EUR
1.0 million ($1.2 million) of outstanding amount against this letter of credit.

Commitments

In the normal course of business, we
enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for non-cancelable
operating lease agreements for our offices, for the development of products, as
well as for the rights to intellectual property. Under these agreements, we
commit to provide specified payments to a lessor, developer, or intellectual
property holder, based upon contractual arrangements. Typically, the payments
to third-party developers are conditioned upon the achievement by the
developers of contractually specified development milestones. These payments to
third-party developers and intellectual property holders typically are deemed
to be advances and are recoupable against future royalties earned by the
developer or intellectual property holder based on the sale of the related
game. Additionally, in

connection with certain intellectual property
right acquisitions and development agreements, we will commit to spend
specified amounts for marketing support for the related game(s) which is to be
developed or in which the intellectual property will be utilized. Additionally,
we lease certain of our facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating
lease agreements. Assuming all contractual provisions are met, the total future
minimum commitments for these and other contractual arrangements in place as of
March 31, 2006, are scheduled to be paid as follows (amounts in thousands):

Facilities
rent expense for the years ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was approximately
$14.2 million, $10.6 million, and $8.7 million, respectively.

Compensation
Guarantee

In June 2005,
we entered into an employment agreement with the President and Chief Executive
Officer of Activision Publishing, Inc. containing a guarantee related to total
compensation. The agreement guarantees that in the event that on May 15, 2010
total compensation has not exceeded $20.0 million, we will make a payment for
the amount of the shortfall. The $20.0 million guarantee will be recognized as
compensation expense evenly

F-27

over the term
of the employment agreement comprising of salary payments, bonus payments,
restricted stock expense, stock option expense, and an accrual for any
anticipated remaining portion of the guarantee. The remaining portion of the
guarantee is accrued over the term of the agreement in “Other liabilities” and
will remain accrued until the end of the employment agreement at which point it
will be used to make a payment for any shortfall or reclassified into
shareholders’ equity.

Legal Proceedings

On March 5,
2004, a class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our current
and former officers and directors. The complaint, which asserts claims under
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on
allegations that our revenues and assets were overstated during the period
between February 1, 2001 and December 17, 2002, was filed in the United States
District Court, Central District of California by the Construction Industry,
and Carpenters Joint Pension Trust for Southern Nevada purporting to represent
a class of purchasers of Activision stock. Five additional purported class
actions were subsequently filed by Gianni Angeloni, Christopher Hinton, Stephen
Anish, the Alaska Electrical Pension Fund, and Joseph A. Romans asserting the
same claims. Consistent with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”),
the court appointed lead plaintiffs consolidating the six putative securities
class actions into a single case. In an Order dated May 16, 2005, the court
dismissed the consolidated complaint because the plaintiffs failed to satisfy
the heightened pleading standards of the PSLRA. The court did, however, give
the lead plaintiffs leave to file an amended consolidated complaint within 30
days of the order. Rather than file a new complaint, the Plaintiff agreed to
dismiss the entire case with prejudice. The Order dismissing the action with
prejudice was entered on June 17, 2005.

In addition,
on March 12, 2004, a shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned

Frank Capovilla, Derivatively on Behalf of
Activision, Inc. v. Robert Kotick, et al.

was filed, purportedly on
behalf of Activision, which in large measure asserts the identical claims set
forth in the federal class action lawsuit. That complaint was filed in
California Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles. On August 11,
2005, in light of the ruling dismissing with prejudice the complaint in the
earlier filed federal securities class action, plaintiffs in the shareholder
derivative action filed an amended complaint, dropping most of the causes of
action, and focusing only on the allegations of insider trading and breaches of
fiduciary duty that were based on the same claimed misrepresentations set forth
in the dismissed federal securities class action. On September 15, 2005,
Activision and the individual defendants filed separate demurrers to the
Derivative Action and a motion to strike plaintiff’s jury demand. Prior to the
hearing on the demurrers, the parties came to a resolution of the action and
agreed to a stipulation of settlement to be submitted to the court for
preliminary approval. No cash recovery is to be paid to the plaintiff pursuant
to the stipulation of settlement, which also stated that the Company vigorously
denied any assertion of wrongdoing or liability. In furtherance of the
settlement, the Company agreed to pay $200,000 in plaintiffs’ fees, to be
funded by the Company’s D&O insurance carrier. The settlement acknowledged
that, after the time the derivative action was filed, the Company implemented
certain enhancements to its corporate governance policies. Notice of Settlement
was mailed and emailed to shareholders as well as posted on the Company’s
website. No objections to settlement were received. At a hearing held on May
22, 2006, the Court approved the settlement and released and dismissed the
alleged claims.

In addition,
we are party to other routine claims and suits brought by us and against us in
the ordinary course of business, including disputes arising over the ownership
of intellectual property rights, contractual claims, employment relationships,
and collection matters. In the opinion of management, after consultation with
legal counsel, the outcome of such routine claims will not have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or
liquidity.

stock options have been granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than
the fair market value at the date of grant.

Other
Employee Stock Options

In connection
with prior employment agreements between Activision and Robert A. Kotick,
Activision’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian G. Kelly,
Activision’s Co-Chairman, Mr. Kotick and Mr. Kelly were granted options to
purchase common stock. The Board of Directors approved the granting of these
options. Relating to such grants, as of March 31, 2006, approximately 8,304,800
shares were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $1.74.

We
additionally have approximately 35,400 options outstanding to employees as of
March 31, 2006, with a weighted average exercise price of $3.48. The Board of
Directors approved the granting of these options. Such options have terms
similar to those options granted under the Plans.

Employee Stock
Purchase Plans

On April 1,
2005, the Board of Directors approved the Second Amended and Restated 2002
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Amended 2002 Purchase Plan”) for eligible
Employees. Under the Amended 2002 Purchase Plan, up to 500,000 shares of our
common stock may be purchased by eligible employees during two six-month
offering periods that commence each April 1 and October 1 (the “Offering Period”).
The first day of each Offering Period is referred to as the “Offering Date.”  Common stock is purchased by the Amended 2002
Purchase Plans participants at 85% of the lesser of fair market value on the
Offering Date for the Offering Period that includes the common stock purchase
date or the fair market value on the common stock purchase date. Employees may
purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation
during an Offering Period, limited to a maximum of $10,000 in value for any two
purchases within the same calendar year. During the year ended March 31, 2006,
employees purchased approximately 101,800 and 282,900 shares at a price of
$9.83 and $11.72 per share, respectively, within the Amended 2002 Purchase
Plans’ Offering Periods.

Prior to the
Amended 2002 Purchase Plan, On January 22, 2002, the Board of Directors
approved the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for eligible domestic employees.
The shareholders of Activision subsequently approved the 2002 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan on September 19, 2002. Then, on February 11, 2003, the Board of
Directors approved the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan For International
Employees. The

F-30

primary terms
of the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan For International Employees (collectively the “2002 Purchase Plans”) are
the same. Under the 2002 Purchase Plans, up to 1,125,000 shares of our common
stock may be purchased by eligible employees during two overlapping,
twelve-month offering periods that commence each April 1 and October 1 (the “Offering
Period”). At any point in time, employees may participate in only one Offering
Period. The first day of each Offering Period is referred to as the “Offering
Date.”  Common stock is purchased by 2002
Purchase Plans participants at 85% of the lesser of fair market value on the
Offering Date for the Offering Period that includes the common stock purchase
date or the fair market value on the common stock purchase date. Employees may
purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation
during an Offering Period, limited to a maximum of 15,000 common shares per
common stock purchase date. During the year ended March 31, 2006, employees
purchased approximately 289,200 shares at a price of $6.45 within the 2002
Purchase Plans’ Offering Period. During the year ended March 31, 2005,
employees purchased approximately 197,100, 67,300 and 349,700 shares at a price
of $8.84, $5.29 and $8.61 per share, respectively, within the 2002 Purchase
Plans’ Offering Periods.

Activity of Employee and Director Options and Warrants

Activity of all employee and director options and warrants during the
last three fiscal years was as follows (amounts in thousands, except weighted
average exercise price amounts):

For the years
ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, all options were granted at an exercise
price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant.

F-31

The following
tables summarize information about all employee and director stock options and
warrants outstanding as of March 31, 2006 (share amounts in thousands):

Non-Employee
Warrants

In prior
years, we have granted stock warrants to third parties in connection with the
development of software and the acquisition of licensing rights for
intellectual property. The warrants generally vest upon grant and are exercisable
over the term of the warrant. The exercise price of third-party warrants is
generally greater than or equal to their fair market value of our common stock
at the date of grant. No third-party warrants were granted during the year
ended March 31, 2006. As of March 31, 2006, 936,000 third-party warrants to
purchase common stock were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price
of $4.54 per share. No third-party warrants were granted during the year ended
March 31, 2005. As of March 31, 2005, 936,000 third-party warrants to purchase
common stock were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $4.54
per share. No third-party warrants were granted during the year ended March 31,
2004. As of March 31, 2004, 2,736,000 third-party warrants to purchase common
stock were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $5.35 per
share.

In accordance
with EITF 96-18, we measure the fair value of the securities on the measurement
date. The fair value of each warrant is capitalized and amortized to expense
when the related product is released and the related revenue is recognized. Additionally,
as more fully described in Note 1, the recoverability of capitalized software
development costs and intellectual property licenses is evaluated on a quarterly
basis with amounts determined as not recoverable being charged to expense. In
connection with the evaluation of capitalized software development costs and
intellectual property licenses, any capitalized amounts for related third-party
warrants are additionally reviewed for recoverability with amounts determined
as not recoverable being amortized to expense. For the years ended March 31,
2006, 2005, and 2004, $0.5 million, $1.6 million, and $0.2 million,
respectively, was amortized and included in cost of sales - software royalties
and amortization and/or cost of sales - intellectual property licenses.

Employee
Retirement Plan

We have a
retirement plan covering substantially all of our eligible employees. The
retirement plan is qualified in accordance with Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. Under the plan, employees may defer up to 92% of their pre-tax
salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute 20% of each dollar
contributed

F-32

by a
participant. Our matching contributions to the plan were approximately $1.3
million, $905,000, and $700,000 during the years ended March 31, 2006, 2005,
and 2004, respectively.

15.

Capital Transactions

Buyback Program

During fiscal 2003, our Board of Directors authorized
a buyback program under which we can repurchase up to $350.0 million of our
common stock. Under the program, shares may be purchased as determined by
management, from time to time and within certain guidelines, in the open market
or in privately negotiated transactions, including privately negotiated
structured stock repurchase transactions and through transactions in the
options markets. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these
purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time
without prior notice.

Under the buyback program, we did not repurchase
any shares of our common stock in the years ended March 31, 2006 and March 31,
2005. We repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares of our common stock for
$12.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2004. In addition, approximately 3.1
million shares of common stock were acquired in the year ended March 31, 2004
as a result of the settlement of $10.0 million of structured stock repurchase
transactions entered into in fiscal 2003. As of March 31, 2006, we had no
outstanding structured stock repurchase transactions. Structured stock
repurchase transactions are settled in cash or stock based on the market price
of our common stock on the date of the settlement. Upon settlement, we either
have our capital investment returned with a premium or receive shares of our
common stock, depending, respectively, on whether the market price of our
common stock is above or below a pre-determined price agreed in connection with
each such transaction. These transactions are recorded in shareholders’ equity
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of March 31, 2006, we had
approximately $226.2 million available for utilization under the buyback
program and no outstanding stock repurchase transactions.

Shelf
Registrations

In August
2003, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission two amended shelf
registration statements, including the base prospectuses therein. The first
shelf registration statement, on Form S-3, allows us, at any time, to offer any
combination of securities described in the base prospectus in one or more
offerings with an aggregate initial offering price of up to $500,000,000. Unless
we state otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, we expect to use
the net proceeds from the sale of the securities for general corporate
purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital, repayment or
reduction of long-term and short-term debt, and the financing of acquisitions
and other business combinations. We may invest funds that we do not immediately
require in marketable securities.

The second
shelf registration statement, on Form S-4, allows us, at any time, to offer any
combination of securities described in the base prospectus in one or more
offerings with an aggregate initial offering price of up to $250,000,000 in
connection with our acquisition of the assets, business or securities of other
companies whether by purchase, merger, or any other form of business
combination.

Shareholders’
Rights Plan

On April 18,
2000, our Board of Directors approved a shareholders rights plan (the “Rights
Plan”). Under the Rights Plan, each common shareholder at the close of business
on April 19, 2000, received a dividend of one right for each share of common
stock held. Each right represents the right to purchase one-six hundredths
(1/600) of a share, as adjusted on account of stock dividends made since the
plan’s adoption, of our Series A Junior Preferred Stock at an exercise price of
$6.67 per share, as adjusted on account of stock dividends made since the plan’s
adoption. Initially, the rights are represented by our common stock
certificates and are neither exercisable nor traded separately from our common
stock. The rights will only become exercisable if a person or group acquires
15% or more of the common stock of Activision, or announces or commences a
tender or exchange offer which would result in the bidder’s beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of our common stock.

In the event
that any person or group acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock
each holder of a right (other than such person or members of such group) will
thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such right, in lieu of
shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock, the number of shares of common stock
of

F-33

Activision
having a value equal to two times the then current exercise price of the right.
If we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after
a person has acquired 15% or more of our common stock, each holder of a right
will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such right a number
of the acquiring company’s common shares having a market value equal to two times
the then current exercise price of the right. For persons who, as of the close
of business on April 18, 2000, beneficially own 15% or more of the common stock
of Activision, the Rights Plan “grandfathers” their current level of ownership,
so long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of certain
limitations.

We may redeem
the rights for $.01 per right at any time until the first public announcement
of the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 15% of our common stock. At any
time after a person has acquired 15% or more (but before any person has
acquired more than 50%) of our common stock, we may exchange all or part of the
rights for shares of common stock at an exchange ratio of one share of common
stock per right. The rights expire on April 18, 2010.

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards and Laws

On December 16, 2004, the

Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)

issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123R”),
which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation (“

SFAS No. 123”). SFAS No. 123R
supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees

, and amends FASB Statement No. 95,

Statement of Cash Flows

.  Generally,
the approach in SFAS No. 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS No.
123.  However, SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the
income statement based on their fair values.  Pro forma disclosure is no
longer an alternative.

SFAS No. 123R permits public
companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods:

•

A “modified prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized
beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS No.
123R for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and (b)
based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to employees
prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R that remain unvested on the
effective date.

•

A “modified retrospective” method which includes the requirements of the
modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to
restate based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS 123 for purposes
of pro forma disclosures either (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior
interim periods of the year of adoption.

F-36

As permitted
by SFAS No. 123, prior to April 1, 2006 we accounted for share-based payments
to employees using APB No. 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally
recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options.  Accordingly,
the adoption of the SFAS No. 123R fair value method will have a significant
impact on our results of operations, although it will have no impact on our
overall financial position. We adopted SFAS No. 123R on April 1, 2006
using the “modified prospective” approach.

We currently believe that the
expensing of stock-based compensation will have an impact on our Consolidated
Statement of Operations similar to our pro-forma disclosure under SFAS No. 123
and expect an impact in fiscal 2007 of approximately $0.05 per share.

On November 24, 2004, the
FASB issued Statement No. 151,

Inventory
Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4

(“SFAS No. 151”). The
standard requires that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs
within inventory should be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed
when incurred. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are applicable to inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 151 will not have a material impact on our financial
position or results of operations.

On December 15, 2004 the FASB
issued Statement No. 153 (“SFAS No. 153”),

Exchanges
of Nonmonetary Assets

—

an
Amendment of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29

. This
standard requires exchanges of productive assets to be accounted for at fair
value, rather than at carryover basis, unless (1) neither the asset received
nor the asset surrendered has a fair value that is determinable within
reasonable limits or (2) the transactions lack commercial substance. The new
standard is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 did not
have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In
May 2005, the FASB issued Statement No. 154 (“SFAS No. 154”),

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections – A
Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3

.
SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of
a change in accounting principle and correction of errors. Under previous
guidance, changes in accounting principle were recognized as a cumulative
effect in the net income of the period of the change. The new statement
requires retrospective application of changes in accounting principle and
correction of errors, limited to the direct effects of the change, to prior
periods’ financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either
the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS
No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made
in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. In the event that we
have an accounting change or an error correction, SFAS No. 154 could have
a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

On February 16, 2006, the
FASB issued Statement No. 155 (“SFAS No. 155”),

Accounting
for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments – An amendment of FASB Statements No.
133 and 140.

SFAS No. 155 amends FASB Statements No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,

and No. 140,

Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities

to resolve
issues addressed in Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, “Application of
Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets.” SFAS
No. 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument
that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation;
clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject
to the requirements of Statement 133; establishes a requirement to evaluate
interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are
freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain
an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation; clarifies that concentrations of
credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives; and amends
Statement 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose
entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a
beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. SFAS
No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the
beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006.
We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 155 to have a material effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

On
March 17, 2006,

the FASB
issued Statement No. 156 (“SFAS No. 156”),

Accounting for Servicing
of Financial Assets – an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140.

SFAS
No. 156 amends Statement No. 140,

Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities,

with respect to the accounting for separately
recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. SFAS No. 156 requires an
entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it
undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a
servicing contract in certain situations; requires all separately recognized
servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair
value, if practicable; permits either the

F-37

amortization method

or the

fair value measurement
method,

as subsequent
measurement methods for each class of separately recognized servicing assets
and servicing liabilities; permits a one-time reclassification of
available-for-sale securities to trading securities by entities with recognized
servicing rights; and requires separate presentation of servicing assets and
servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value in the statement of
financial position and additional disclosures for all separately recognized
servicing assets and servicing liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is effective in the
first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We do not expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 156 to have a material effect on our financial position or
results of operations.

On October 22, 2004, the President of the United States signed the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) which contains a number of tax
law modifications with accounting implications. For companies that pay U.S.
income taxes on manufacturing activities in the U.S., the Act provides a
deduction from taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified
income from domestic production activities. The manufacturing deduction provided
by the Act replaces the extraterritorial income (“ETI”) deduction currently in
place. We currently derive benefits from the ETI exclusion which was repealed
by the Act. Our exclusion for fiscal 2006 and 2007 will be limited to 75% and
45% of the otherwise allowable exclusion and no exclusion will be available in
fiscal 2008 and thereafter. The Act also creates a temporary incentive for U.S.
multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an
85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign
corporations (“Homeland Investment Act”). The deduction is subject to a number
of limitations. The Act also provides for other changes in tax law that will
affect a variety of taxpayers. On December 21, 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued two FASB Staff Positions (“FSP”) regarding the
accounting implications of the Act related to (1) the deduction for qualified
domestic production activities and (2) the one-time tax benefit for the repatriation
of foreign earnings. The FASB determined that the deduction for qualified
domestic production activities should be accounted for as a special deduction
under FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for
Income Taxes

. The FASB also confirmed, that upon deciding that some
amount of earnings will be repatriated, a company must record in that period
the associated tax liability. The guidance in the FSPs apply to financial
statements for periods ending after the date the Act was enacted.

We have evaluated the Act and have concluded
that we will not repatriate foreign earnings under the Homeland Investment Act
Provisions.

Subsequent
Events

On May 3, 2006, we announced that MGM Interactive
and EON Productions, Ltd. have awarded us the rights to develop and publish
interactive entertainment games based on the James Bond license through 2014. The
agreement, signed on April 11, 2006, did not have an impact on our March 31,
2006 statement of financial condition or results of operations.

On May 9, 2006, we announced that we have entered
into an agreement, signed on May 6, 2006, to acquire video game publisher
RedOctane, Inc. (“RedOctane”), the publisher of the Guitar Hero franchise. Under
the terms of the agreement, RedOctane became a wholly owned subsidiary of
Activision and RedOctane’s management team and key employees signed long-term
employment contracts with Activision. RedOctane will continue to be based in
Sunnyvale, CA.

The agreement,
did not have an impact on our March 31, 2006 statement of financial condition
or results of operations.
