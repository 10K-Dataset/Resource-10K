Item 1. BUSINESS

(a)

General

Activision, Inc.
("Activision" or "we") is a leading international publisher of interactive entertainment software products. We have built a company with a diverse portfolio of
products that spans a wide range of categories and target markets and that is used on a variety of game hardware platforms and operating systems. We have created, licensed and acquired a group of
highly recognizable brands which we market to a growing variety of consumer demographics.

Our
products cover the action, adventure, action-sports, racing, role-playing, simulation and strategy game categories. Over the next few years, we plan to produce products
in versions that operate on the Sony PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube and Microsoft Xbox console systems, the Nintendo Game Boy hand held devices, as well as on personal computers. Driven partly by
the enhanced capabilities of these next generation of platforms, we believe that in the next few years there will be significant growth in the market for interactive entertainment software and we plan
to leverage our skills, experience and resources to extend our leading position in the industry.

Our
publishing business involves the development, marketing and sale of products, either directly, by license or through our affiliate label program with third party publishers. In
addition to publishing, we maintain distribution operations in Europe that provide logistical and sales services to third party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing
operations and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

We
were originally incorporated in California in 1979. In December 1992, we reincorporated in Delaware. In June 2000, we reorganized into a holding company organizational
structure. As a result of this reorganization, Activision, Inc. as it previously existed became our primary operating subsidiary and changed its name to Activision Publishing, Inc.

(b)

Business
Combinations

Over
the years, we have consummated a number of acquisitions of both software development companies and software distribution companies. The interactive entertainment industry is
consolidating, and we intend to continue to expand our resources through acquisitions, strategic relationships and key license transactions. We expect to focus our acquisition strategy on increasing
our development capacity through the acquisition of or investment in selected experienced development firms.

During
fiscal 2002, we completed the acquisition of three privately held interactive software development companies. These acquisitions further enable us to implement our multi-platform
development strategy by bolstering our internal product development capabilities for the next generation console systems and personal computers and strengthen our position in the first person action,
action and action-sports genres. Effective October 1, 2001, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests of Treyarch Invention, LLC ("Treyarch"), a privately held interactive software
development company. Treyarch is a console software developer with a focus on action and action-sports video games. On December 30, 1999, we acquired a 40% interest in the outstanding capital
stock of Gray Matter Interactive Studios, Inc., formerly known as Video Games West ("Gray Matter"), a privately held software development company, as well as an option to purchase the remaining
60% of outstanding capital stock. Effective January 9, 2002, we exercised our option to acquire the remaining 60% equity interest in Gray Matter. Gray Matter was the developer for our first
person action PC product,

Return to Castle Wolfenstein

and is working on a sequel to such product and a new original action
product

.

On March 27, 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests of Shaba Games, LLC ("Shaba"), a privately held interactive
software development company. Shaba is a console software developer with a focus on action and action-sports video games.


Subsequent
to March 31, 2002, we acquired a fourth privately held interactive software development company and made a 30% equity investment in a fifth company. On May 20,
2002, we acquired all of the outstanding capital of Z-Axis Ltd. ("Z-Axis"), a privately held interactive software development company. Z-Axis is a console
software developer with a focus on action and action-sports video games. On May 10, 2002, we acquired 30% of the outstanding capital stock of Infinity Ward, Inc. ("Infinity Ward"), as
well as an option to purchase the remaining 70% of the outstanding capital stock of Infinity Ward. Infinity Ward is a privately held interactive software development company with a focus on first
person action games for personal computers.

See
the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these and prior
acquisitions.

(c)

Financial
Information About Industry Segments

We
have two reportable segments: publishing and distribution. Publishing relates to the development (both internally and externally), marketing and sale of CD-based and
cartridge-based interactive entertainment software products owned or controlled by us, either directly, by license or through our affiliate label program with third party publishers. Distribution
primarily refers to logistical and sales services provided by our European distribution subsidiaries to third party publishers of interactive entertainment software and manufacturers of interactive
entertainment hardware. See the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain financial information required
by Item 1.

Narrative
Description of Business

Factors Affecting Future Performance

In connection with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Litigation Reform Act"), we are hereby disclosing certain cautionary information to
be used in connection with written materials (including this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and oral statements made by or on behalf of our employees and representatives that may
contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Litigation Reform Act. Such statements consist of any statement other than a recitation of historical fact and can be identified by the
use of forward-looking terminology such as "may," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate" or "continue" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. The listener or reader
is cautioned that all forward-looking statements are necessarily speculative and there are numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those
referred to in such forward-looking statements. The discussion below highlights some of the more important risks identified by management, but should not be assumed to be the only factors that could
affect future performance. The reader or listener is cautioned that we do not have a policy of updating or revising forward-looking statements and thus he or she should not assume that silence by
management over time means that actual events are bearing out as estimated in such forward-looking statements.

We depend on a relatively small number of brands for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.

A significant portion of our revenues is derived from products based on a relatively small number of popular brands each year. In addition, many of these products
have substantial production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets. In fiscal 2002, 50% of our worldwide net publishing revenues
(35% of consolidated net revenues) was derived from two brands, one of which accounted for 44% and the other of which accounted for 6% of worldwide net publishing revenues (31% and 4%, respectively,
of consolidated net revenues). In fiscal 2001, two brands accounted for 49% of our worldwide net publishing revenues (37% of consolidated net revenues), one of which accounted for 39% and the other of
which accounted for 10% of worldwide net publishing revenues (29% and 8%, respectively, of


consolidated net revenues). We expect that a limited number of popular brands will continue to produce a disproportionately large amount of our revenues. Due to this dependence on a limited number of
brands, the failure of one or more products based on these brands to achieve anticipated results may significantly harm our business and financial results.

Our future success depends on our ability to release popular products.

The life of any one game product is relatively short, in many cases less than one year. It is therefore important for us to be able to continue to develop many
high quality new products that are popularly received. If we are unable to do this, our business and financial results may be negatively affected.

We
focus our development and publishing activities principally on products that are, or have the potential to become, franchise brand properties. Many of these products are based on
intellectual property and other character or story rights acquired or licensed from third parties. These license and distribution agreements are limited in scope and time, and we may not be able to
renew key licenses when they expire or to include new products in existing licenses. The loss of a significant number of our intellectual property licenses or of our relationships with licensors could
have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop new products and therefore on our business and financial results.

Transitions in console platforms have a material impact on the market for interactive entertainment software.

When new console platforms are announced or introduced into the market, consumers typically reduce their purchases of game console entertainment software products
for current console platforms in anticipation of new platforms becoming available. During these periods, sales of our game console entertainment software products can be expected to slow down or even
decline until new platforms have been introduced and have achieved wide consumer acceptance. Each of the three current principal hardware producers launched a new platform in recent years. Sony made
the first shipments of its PlayStation 2 console system in North America and Europe in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2000. Microsoft made the first shipments of its Xbox console system in North
America in November 2001 and in Europe and Japan in the first quarter of calendar 2002. Nintendo made the first shipments of its Nintendo GameCube console system in North America in
November 2001 and in Europe in May 2002. Additionally, in June 2001, Nintendo launched its Game Boy Advance hand held device. We believe the next hardware transition cycle will
occur in 2005. Delays in the launch, shortages, technical problems or lack of consumer acceptance of these platforms could adversely affect our sales of products for these platforms.

We must make significant expenditures to develop products for new platforms which may not be successful or released when anticipated.

The interactive entertainment software industry is subject to rapid technological change. New technologies could render our current products or products in
development obsolete or unmarketable. We must continually anticipate and assess the emergence and market acceptance of new interactive entertainment software platforms well in advance of the time the
platform is introduced to consumers. New platforms have historically required the development of new software and also have the effect of undermining demand for products based on older technologies.
Because product development cycles are difficult to predict, we must make substantial product development and other investments in a particular platform well in advance of introduction of the
platform. If the platforms for which we develop new software products or modify existing products are not released on a timely basis or do not attain significant market penetration, or if we develop
products for a delayed or unsuccessful platform, we may not be able to recover in revenues our development costs which could be significant and our business and financial results could be
significantly harmed. An announcement by Sega Corporation in


calendar 2001 that it was discontinuing its Dreamcast platform shows that even experienced hardware manufacturers are not immune to failure.

We are exposed to seasonality in the purchases of our products.

The interactive entertainment software industry is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the year-end holiday
buying season. As a result, our net revenues, gross profits and operating income have historically been highest during the second half of the year. Additionally, in a platform transition period, sales
of game console software products can be significantly affected by the timeliness of introduction of game console platforms by the manufacturers of those platforms, such as Sony, Microsoft and
Nintendo. The timing of hardware platform introduction is also often tied to holidays and is not within our control. Further, delays in development, licensor approvals or manufacturing can also affect
the timing of the release of our products, causing us to miss key selling periods such as the year-end holiday buying season.

We depend on skilled personnel.

Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify, hire and retain skilled personnel. The software industry is characterized by a high level
of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors for personnel with technical, marketing, sales, product development and management skills. We may not be able to attract and retain
skilled personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do so. If we are unable to attract additional qualified employees or retain the services of key personnel, our business and financial
results could be negatively impacted.

We depend on Sony and Nintendo for the manufacture of products that we develop for their hardware platforms.

Generally, when we develop interactive entertainment software products for hardware platforms offered by Sony or Nintendo, the products are manufactured
exclusively by that hardware manufacturer. Our hardware platform licenses with Sony and Nintendo provide that the manufacturer may change prices for the manufacturing of products.

In
addition, these agreements include other provisions such as approval rights of all products and related promotional materials that give the manufacturer substantial control over our
costs and the release of new titles. Since each of the manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware platforms and manufactures products for all of its other licensees, a
manufacturer may give priority to its own products or those of our competitors in the event of insufficient manufacturing capacity. Our business and financial results could be materially harmed by
unanticipated delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our products by Sony and Nintendo. In addition, our business and financial results could be materially harmed if Sony or Nintendo used their
rights under these agreements to delay the manufacture or delivery of our products, limit the costs recoverable by us to manufacture software for their consoles, or elect to manufacture software
themselves or use developers other than us.

If our products contain defects, our business could be harmed significantly.

Software products as complex as the ones we publish may contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions are released. We cannot assure you
that, despite extensive testing prior to release, errors will not be found in new products or releases after shipment, resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance. This loss or delay could
significantly harm our business and financial results.


Inadequate intellectual property protections could prevent us from enforcing or defending our proprietary technology.

We regard our software as proprietary and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements
and other methods to protect our proprietary rights. We own or license various copyrights and trademarks. While we provide "shrinkwrap" license agreements or limitations on use with our software, it
is uncertain to what extent these agreements and limitations are enforceable. We are aware that some unauthorized copying occurs within the computer software industry, and if a significantly greater
amount of unauthorized copying of
our interactive entertainment software products were to occur, it could cause material harm to our business and financial results.

Policing
unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and software piracy can be a persistent problem, especially in some international markets. Further, the laws of some countries
where our products are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or are poorly enforced. Legal
protection of our rights may be ineffective in such countries, and as we leverage our software products using emerging technologies such as the Internet and online services, our ability to protect our
intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others may diminish. We cannot assure you that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection
for our products in connection with these emerging technologies.

We may be subject to intellectual property claims.

As the number of interactive entertainment software products increases and the features and content of these products continue to overlap, software developers
increasingly may become subject to infringement claims. Many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on real world examples, which may inadvertently infringe upon the
intellectual property rights of others. Although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others, it is possible that
third parties still may claim infringement. From time to time, we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid or
not, may be time consuming and expensive to defend.

Intellectual
property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:

•

Cease
selling, incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;

•

Obtain
a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which if available at all, may not be available on commercially favorable terms; or

•

Redesign
our interactive entertainment software products, which could cause us to incur additional costs, delay introduction and possibly reduce commercial
appeal of our products.

Any
of these actions may cause material harm to our business and financial results.

We rely on independent third parties to develop many of our software products.

We often rely on independent third party interactive entertainment software developers to develop many of our software products. Since we depend on these
developers in the aggregate, we remain subject to the following risks:

•

Continuing
strong demand for developers' resources, combined with recognition they receive in connection with their work, may cause developers who worked for
us in the past to either work for our competitors in the future or to renegotiate our agreements with them on terms less favorable for us.


•

Limited
financial resources and business expertise and inability to retain skilled personnel may force developers out of business prior to completing our
products or require us to fund additional costs.

•

Our
competitors may acquire the businesses of key developers or sign them to exclusive development arrangements. In either case, we would not be able to
engage such developers' services for our products.

Increased
competition for skilled third party software developers also has compelled us to agree to make significant advance payments on royalties to game developers. If the products
subject to these arrangements do not generate sufficient revenues to recover these royalty advances, we would have to write-off unrecovered portions of these payments, which could cause
material harm to our business and financial results. In a few cases, we also agree to pay developers fixed per unit product royalties after royalty advances are fully recouped. To the extent that
sales prices of products on which we have agreed to pay a fixed per unit royalty are marked down, our profitability could be adversely affected.

We operate in a highly competitive industry.

The interactive entertainment software industry is intensely competitive and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly
introduced. Our competitors vary in size from small companies to very large corporations with significantly greater financial, marketing and product development resources than we have. Due to these
greater resources, certain of our competitors can undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, pay higher fees to licensors for desirable motion picture,
television, sports and character properties and pay more to third party software developers than we can. We believe that the main competitive factors in the interactive entertainment software industry
include: product features; brand name recognition;
compatibility of products with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; quality of products; ease of use; price; marketing support; and quality of customer service.

We
compete primarily with other publishers of personal computer and video game console interactive entertainment software. Significant third party software competitors currently include,
among others: Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.; Capcom Co. Ltd.; Eidos PLC; Electronic Arts Inc.; Infogrames SA; Konami Company Ltd.; Namco Ltd.; Midway
Games, Inc.; Sega Enterprises, Ltd.; Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.; THQ Inc. and Vivendi Universal Publishing. In addition, integrated video game console
hardware and software companies such as Sony Computer Entertainment, Nintendo Co. Ltd. and Microsoft Corporation compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their
respective platforms.

We
also compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities. For example, we believe that the overall growth in the use of the Internet and online services by consumers may
pose a competitive threat if customers and potential customers spend less of their available time using interactive entertainment software and more using the Internet and online services.

We may face difficulty obtaining access to retail shelf space necessary to market and sell our products effectively.

Retailers of our products typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources, and there is intense competition among consumer interactive
entertainment software products for high quality retail shelf space and promotional support from retailers. To the extent that the number of products and platforms increases, competition for shelf
space may intensify and may require us to increase our marketing expenditures. Retailers with limited shelf space typically devote the most and highest quality shelf space to the best selling
products. We cannot assure you that our new products will consistently achieve such "best seller" status. Due to increased competition for limited shelf space, retailers and distributors are in an
increasingly better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale,


including price discounts, price protection, marketing and display fees and product return policies. Our products constitute a relatively small percentage of any retailer's sales volume, and we
cannot assure you that retailers will continue to purchase our products or to provide our products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support on acceptable terms. A prolonged failure
in this regard may significantly harm our business and financial results.

Our sales may decline substantially without warning and in a brief period of time because we generally do not have long-term contracts for the sale of our products.

We currently sell our products directly through our own sales force to mass merchants, warehouse club stores, large computer and software specialty chains and
through catalogs, as well as to a limited
number of distributors, in the United States and Canada. Outside North America, we sell our products directly to retailers as well as third party distributors in certain territories. Our sales are
made primarily on a purchase order basis without long-term agreements or other forms of commitments. The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any of our principal retail
customers or distributors could significantly harm our business and financial results. Our two largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Toys "R" Us, Inc., accounted for
approximately 14% and 7%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2002. Our five largest retailers including Wal-Mart and Toys "R" Us, accounted for approximately 35% of
our consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2002. Wal-Mart and Toys "R" Us, accounted for approximately 10% and 9%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2001. Our five
largest retailers, including Wal-Mart and Toys "R" Us, accounted for approximately 34% of our consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2001.

We may permit our customers to return our products and to receive pricing concessions which could reduce our net revenues and results of operations.

We are exposed to the risk of product returns and price protection with respect to our distributors and retailers. Return policies allow distributors and
retailers to return defective, shelf-worn and damaged products in accordance with terms granted. Price protection policies, when granted and applicable, allow customers a credit against
amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them. We may permit product returns from or grant price protection to our customers under certain conditions. The conditions our customers
must meet to be granted the right to return products or price protection are, among other things, compliance with applicable payment terms, delivery to us of weekly inventory and
sell-through reports, and consistent participation in the launches of our premium title releases. We may also consider other factors, including the facilitation of slow moving inventory
and other market factors. When we offer price protection, we offer it with respect to a particular product to all of our retail customers, however, only those customers who meet the conditions
detailed above can avail themselves of such price protection. We also offer a 90-day limited warranty to our end users that our products will be free from manufacturing defects. Although
we maintain a reserve for returns and price protection, and although we may place limits on product returns and price protection, we could be forced to accept substantial product returns and provide
price protection to maintain our relationships with retailers and our access to distribution channels. Product returns and price protection that exceed our reserves could significantly harm our
business and financial results.

We may be burdened with payment defaults and uncollectible accounts if our distributors or retailers cannot honor their credit arrangement with us.

Distributors and retailers in the interactive entertainment software industry have from time to time experienced significant fluctuations in their businesses, and
a number of them have failed. The insolvency or business failure of any significant retailer or distributor of our products could materially harm our business and financial results. We typically make
sales to most of our retailers and some distributors on unsecured credit, with terms that vary depending upon the customer's credit history,


solvency, credit limits and sales history, as well as whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance. Although we have insolvency risk insurance to protect against our customers' bankruptcy,
insolvency or
liquidation, this insurance contains a significant deductible and a co-payment obligation, and the policy does not cover all instances of non-payment. In addition, while we
maintain a reserve for uncollectible receivables, the reserve may not be sufficient in every circumstance. As a result, a payment default by a significant customer could significantly harm our
business and financial results.

We may not be able to maintain our distribution relationships with key vendors.

Our CD Contact, NBG and CentreSoft subsidiaries distribute interactive entertainment software and hardware products and provide related services in the Benelux
territories, Germany and the United Kingdom, respectively, and via export, in other European territories for a variety of entertainment software publishers, many of which are our competitors, and
hardware manufacturers. These services are generally performed under limited term contracts. While we expect to use reasonable efforts to retain these vendors, we may not be successful in this regard.
The cancellation or non-renewal of one or more of these contracts could significantly harm our business and financial results. Sony and Nintendo products accounted for approximately 34%
and 8%, respectively, of our worldwide net distribution revenues for fiscal 2002.

Our international revenues may be subject to regulatory requirements as well as currency fluctuations.

Our international revenues have accounted for a significant portion of our total revenues. International sales and licensing accounted for 49%, 43% and 51% of our
total net revenues in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues in the future.
International sales may be subject to unexpected regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers. Additionally, foreign sales which are made in local currencies may fluctuate. Presently, we engage
in limited currency hedging activities. Although exposure to currency fluctuations to date has been insignificant, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may in the future have a material negative
impact on revenues from international sales and licensing and thus our business and financial results.

Our software may be subject to governmental restrictions or rating systems.

Legislation is periodically introduced at the local, state and federal levels in the United States and in foreign countries to establish a system for providing
consumers with information about graphic violence and sexually explicit material contained in interactive entertainment software products. In addition, many foreign countries have laws that permit
governmental entities to censor the content and advertising of interactive entertainment software. We believe that mandatory government-run rating systems eventually may be adopted in many
countries that are significant markets or potential markets for our products. We may be required to modify our products or alter our marketing strategies to comply with new regulations, which could
delay the release of our products in those countries.

Due
to the uncertainties regarding such rating systems, confusion in the marketplace may occur, and we are unable to predict what effect, if any, such rating systems would have on our
business. In addition to such regulations, certain retailers have in the past declined to stock some of our products because they believed that the content of the packaging artwork or the products
would be offensive to the retailer's customer base. While to date these actions have not caused material harm to our business, we cannot assure you that similar actions by our distributors or
retailers in the future would not cause material harm to our business.


Our software may be subject to legal claims.

Within the past three years, two lawsuits,

Linda Sanders, et al. v. Meow Media, Inc., et al

, United States
District Court for the District of Colorado, and

Joe James, et al. v. Meow Media, Inc., et al

, United States District Court for the Western
District of Kentucky, Paducah Division, have been filed against numerous video game companies, including us, by the families of victims who were shot and killed by teenage gunmen in attacks
perpetrated at schools. These lawsuits allege that the video game companies manufactured and/or supplied these teenagers with violent video games, teaching them how to use a gun and causing them to
act out in a violent manner. Both lawsuits referenced in this paragraph have been dismissed and are currently undergoing various stages of the appeals process. While our general liability insurance
carrier has agreed to defend us in these lawsuits, it is uncertain whether or not the insurance carrier would cover all or any amounts which we might be liable for if the lawsuits are not decided in
our favor. If either of the lawsuits are ultimately decided against us and our insurance carrier does not cover the amounts we are liable for, it could have a material adverse effect on our business
and financial results. It is possible that similar additional lawsuits may be filed in the future. Payment of significant claims by insurance carriers may make such insurance coverage materially more
expensive or unavailable in the future, thereby exposing our business to additional risk.

We may face limitations on our ability to integrate additional acquired businesses or to find suitable acquisition opportunities.

We intend to pursue additional acquisitions of companies, properties and other assets that can be purchased or licensed on acceptable terms and which we believe
can be operated or exploited profitably. Some of these transactions could be material in size and scope. While we will continually be searching for additional acquisition opportunities, we may not be
successful in identifying suitable acquisitions. As the interactive entertainment software industry continues to consolidate, we face significant competition in seeking and consummating acquisition
opportunities. We may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or an acquisition may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings. In the future, we may issue
additional shares of our common stock in connection with one or more acquisitions, which may dilute our existing shareholders. Future acquisitions could also divert substantial management time and
result in short term reductions in earnings or special transaction or other charges. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate the businesses that we may acquire
into our existing business. Our shareholders may not have the opportunity to review, vote on or evaluate future acquisitions.

Our shareholder rights plan, charter documents and other agreements may make it more difficult to acquire us without the approval of our Board of Directors.

We have adopted a shareholder rights plan under which one right entitling the holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of our Series A
Junior Preferred Stock price at an exercise price of $40 per share (subject to adjustment) is attached to each outstanding share of common stock. Such shareholder rights plan makes an acquisition of
control in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors more difficult. Our Amended and Restated By-laws have advance notice provisions for nominations for election of nominees to
the Board of Directors which may make it more difficult to acquire control of us. Our long-term incentive plans provide for acceleration of stock options following a change in control,
which has the effect of making an acquisition of control more expensive. A change in control constitutes a default under our revolving credit facility. In addition, some of our officers have severance
compensation agreements that provide for substantial cash payments and accelerations of other benefits in the event of a change in control. These agreements and arrangements may also inhibit a change
in control and may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.


Our stock price is highly volatile.

The trading price of our common stock has been and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to certain factors, including:

•

Quarter
to quarter variations in results of operations

•

Our
announcements of new products

•

Our
competitors' announcements of new products

•

Our
product development or release schedule

•

In
addition, the public stock markets experience extreme price and trading volume volatility, particularly in high technology sectors of the market. This volatility has significantly
affected the market
prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market
price of our common stock.

We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the near future. In addition, our revolving credit facility
currently prohibits us from paying cash dividends on our common stock.

Strategy

Our objective is to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing and distribution of quality interactive entertainment software products that deliver a
highly satisfying consumer entertainment experience. Our strategy includes the following elements:

Create and Maintain Diversity in Product Mix, Platforms and Markets.

We believe that maintaining a diversified mix of
products can reduce our operating risks and enhance profitability. Therefore, we develop and publish products spanning a wide range of product categories, including action, adventure, action-sports,
racing, role playing, simulation and strategy, and products designed for target audiences ranging from game enthusiasts and children to mass market consumers and "value priced" buyers. Presently, we
concentrate on developing, publishing and distributing products that operate on Sony PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube and Microsoft Xbox console systems, Nintendo Game Boy hand held devices and the
personal computer. We typically offer our products for use on multiple platforms in order to reduce the risks associated with any single platform, leverage our costs over a larger installed base and
increase unit sales.

Create, Acquire and Maintain Strong Brands.

We focus development and publishing activities principally on products that are,
or have the potential to become, franchise properties with sustainable consumer appeal and brand recognition. These products can thereby serve as the basis for sequels, prequels and related new
products that can be released over an extended period of time. We believe that the publishing and distribution of products based in large part on franchise properties enhances predictability of
revenues and the probability of high unit volume sales and operating profits. We have entered into a series of strategic relationships with the owners of intellectual property pursuant to


which we have acquired the rights to publish products based on franchises such as Star Trek, various Disney films such as Toy Story 2 and Marvel Comics' properties such as Spider-Man,
X-Men, Blade, Iron Man and Fantastic Four. We have also capitalized on the success of our Tony Hawk's Pro Skater products to sign long-term agreements, many of which are
exclusive, with numerous other action-sports athletes including superstars Mat Hoffman in BMX biking, Kelly Slater in surfing, Shaun Palmer in
snowboarding, Shaun Murray in wakeboarding and Travis Pastrana in motorcross biking and establish the "Activision O


" brand as the dominant brand in the action-sports category.

Enforce Disciplined Product Selection and Development Processes.

The success of our publishing business depends, in
significant part, on our ability to develop games that will generate high unit volume sales and that can be completed up to our high quality standards. Our publishing units have implemented a formal
control process for the selection, development, production and quality assurance of our products. We apply this process, which we refer to as the "Greenlight Process," to products under development
with external, as well as internal resources. The Greenlight Process includes in-depth reviews of each project at five intervals during the development process by a team that includes
several of our highest ranking operating managers and coordination between our sales and marketing personnel and development staff at each step in the process.

We
develop our products using a strategic combination of our internal development resources and external development resources acting under contract with us, some of who are independent
and in some of which we have a capital investment. We typically select our external developers based on their track record and expertise in producing products in the same category. One developer will
often produce the same game for multiple platforms and will produce sequels to the original game. We believe that this selection process allows us to strengthen and leverage the particular expertise
of our internal and external development resources.

Continue to Improve Profitability.

We are continually striving to reduce our risk and increase our operating leverage and
efficiency with the goal of increased profitability. We believe the key factor affecting our profitability will be the success rate of our product releases. Therefore, our product selection and
development process includes, as a significant component, periodic evaluations of the expected commercial success of products under development. Through this process, titles that we determine to be
less promising are either discontinued before we incur additional development costs, or if necessary, corrections can be made in the development process. In addition, our focus on cross platform
releases and branded products will, we believe, contribute to this strategic goal.

In
order to further our emphasis on improved profitability, we have implemented a number of operational initiatives. We have increased our product development capabilities by allocating
a portion of our product development investments to experienced independent development companies working under contract with us, thereby taking advantage of specialized third party developers without
incurring the fixed overhead obligations associated with increased internally employed staff. Additionally, we have acquired certain experienced and specialized developers when, in our opinion, we can
enhance profitability through the elimination of royalty obligations. Our sales and marketing operations work with our studio resources to increase the visibility of new product launches and to
coordinate timing and promotion of product releases. Our finance and administration and sales and marketing personnel work together to improve inventory management and receivables collections. We have
broadly instituted objective-based reward programs that provide incentives to management and staff throughout the organization to produce results that meet our financial objectives.

Grow Through Continued Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances.

The interactive entertainment industry is consolidating, and we
believe that success in this industry will be driven in part by the ability to take advantage of scale. Specifically, smaller companies are more capital constrained, enjoy less predictability of
revenues and cash flow, lack product diversity and must spread fixed costs over a smaller revenue base. Several industry leaders are emerging that combine the entrepreneurial and


creative spirit of the industry with professional management, the ability to access the capital markets and the ability to maintain favorable relationships with strategic developers, property owners
and retailers. Through 13 completed acquisitions since 1997, we believe that we have successfully diversified our operations, our channels of distribution, our development talent pool and our library
of titles, and have emerged as one of the industry's leaders. We intend to continue to expand our resources through acquisitions, strategic relationships and key license transactions. We expect to
focus our acquisition strategy on increasing our development capacity through the acquisition of or investment in selected experienced development firms, and expanding our intellectual property
library through licenses and strategic relationships with intellectual property owners.

Products

We historically have been best known for our action, adventure, strategy and simulation products. With the successful introduction of our series of Activision
O


branded products, such as our Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX and Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarding series, we have also become the leader in the action-sports category. We
have also established ourselves as a leader in the "value priced" software publishing business with such products as Cabela's Big Game Hunter series and Ski Resort Tycoon. Products published by us in
this category are generally developed by third parties, often under contract with us, and are marketed under the Activision Value Publishing name. Value priced software is typically less sophisticated
and complex, both in terms of the development process and consumer ease of use. We also publish products in other categories such as leisure and role playing, and we may in the future expand our
product offerings into new categories.

Hardware Licenses.

Our products currently are being developed or published primarily for Sony PlayStation 2, Nintendo
GameCube and Microsoft Xbox console systems, Nintendo Game Boy hand held devices and personal computers. In order to maintain general access to the console systems and hand held device marketplace, we
have maintained licenses for Sony PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube and Microsoft Xbox console systems and Game Boy hand held devices with owners of such platforms. Each license allows us to create
multiple products for the applicable system, subject to certain approval rights as to quality which are reserved by each licensor. Each license also requires that we pay the licensor a per unit
license fee for each unit manufactured. In contrast, we currently are not required to obtain any license for the development and production of products for personal computers.

Intellectual Property Rights.

Our current and planned releases are based on intellectual property and other character or
story rights licensed from third parties, as well as a combination of characters, worlds and concepts derived from our extensive library of titles, and original characters and concepts owned and
created by us. In publishing products based on licensed intellectual property rights, we
generally seek to capitalize on the name recognition, marketing efforts and goodwill associated with the underlying property.

In
acquiring intellectual property rights from third parties, we seek to obtain rights to publish titles across a variety of platforms, to include the ability to produce multiple titles
and to retain rights over an extended period of time. In past years, we have been able to enter into a series of long-term or multi-product agreements with owners of various intellectual
properties that are well known throughout the world, and to create products based on these recognizable characters, story lines or concepts. These agreements typically provide us with exclusive
publishing rights for a specific period of time, and in some cases for specified platforms. The scope of our licensing activities includes theatrical motion pictures, television shows, animated films
and series, comic books, literary works, sports personalities and events and celebrities. We intend to continue expanding relationships with our existing intellectual property partners and to enter
into agreements with other intellectual property owners for other recognizable properties, characters, story lines and concepts. We may not, however, be able to maintain or expand our existing
relationships or to seek out and sustain new long-term relationships of similar caliber in the future.


Product Development and Support

We use a strategic mix of internal and external resources to develop our products. In addition to product developers we own entirely or control, we consider
production developers in which we have a significant minority equity investment and those with which we have long-term agreements to develop multiple titles or sequels to be part of our
internal product development effort. All of our product development efforts are managed under our "Greenlight Process," a formal management control process for the selection, development and quality
assurance of our products.

We
develop and produce titles using a model in which a core group of creative, production and technical professionals, in cooperation with our marketing and finance departments, have
overall responsibility for the entire development and production process and for the supervision and coordination of internal and external resources. This team assembles the necessary creative
elements to complete a title using, where appropriate, outside programmers, artists, animators, scriptwriters, musicians and songwriters, sound effects and special effects experts, and sound and video
studios. We believe that this model allows us to supplement internal expertise with top quality external resources on an as needed basis.

In
addition, we often seek out and engage independent third party developers to create products on our behalf. Such products are usually owned by us, and we have unlimited rights to
commercially exploit these products. We typically select these independent third party developers based on their expertise in developing products in a specific category and use the same developer to
produce the same game for multiple platforms. Each of our third party developers is under contract with us for specific
or multiple titles. From time to time, we also license or acquire software products independently created by third party developers and brought to us for publishing and/or distribution. In such cases,
the agreements with such developers provide us with exclusive publishing and/or distribution rights for a specific period of time, often for specified platforms and territories. In either case, we
often have the ability to publish and/or distribute sequels, conversions, enhancements and add-ons to the product initially being produced by the independent developer and frequently have
the right to engage the services of the original developer in regards to the development of such products.

In
consideration for the services provided by independent third party developers, the developer receives a royalty generally based on net sales of the product that it has developed.
Typically, the developer also receives an advance, which is recoupable by us from the royalties otherwise required to be paid to the developer. The advance generally is paid in stages with the payment
of each stage tied to the completion of a detailed performance milestone. Working with independent developers allows us to reduce our fixed development costs, share development risks with another
company, take advantage of third party developers' expertise in connection with certain categories of products or certain platforms and gain access to proprietary development technologies.

From
time to time, we may make a capital investment and hold a minority interest in a third party developer in connection with entertainment software products to be developed by such
developer for us, which we believe helps to create a closer relationship between us and the developer. We have a minority interest in, among others, Infinity Ward, Pandemic Studios and Raster
Productions. We account for those capital investments in which we have a 20% or greater ownership interest, such as Infinity Ward, or over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence,
using the equity method. For those investments in which we hold less than a 20% ownership interest, such as Pandemic Studios and Raster Productions, or over which we do not have the ability to
exercise significant influence, we account for our investment using the cost method. There can be no assurance that we will realize long-term benefits from such type of investments or that
we will continue to carry such investments at their current value.


"Greenlight Process"

We have adopted and implemented a rigorous procedure for the selection, development, production and quality assurance of our internally and externally produced
entertainment software titles. The process, entitled the "Greenlight Process," involves five phases throughout the pre-development, development and production phases of the title, each of
which includes a number of specific performance milestones. The five phases of our "Greenlight Process" are the concept phase, assessment phase, prototype phase, first playable phase and alpha phase.
This procedure is designed to enable us to manage and control production and development budgets and timetables, to identify and address production and technical issues at the earliest opportunity,
and to coordinate marketing and quality control strategies throughout the production and development phases, all in an environment that fosters creativity. Checks and balances are intended to be
provided through the structured interaction
of the project team with our creative, technical, marketing and quality assurance/customer support personnel, as well as the legal, accounting and finance departments.

Product Support

We provide various forms of product support to both our internally and externally developed titles. Our quality assurance personnel are involved throughout the
development and production processes for each title published by us. All such products are subjected to extensive testing before release in order to ensure compatibility with the widest possible array
of hardware configurations and to minimize the number of bugs and other defects found in the products. To support our products after release, we provide online access to our customers on a
24-hour basis as well as operator help lines during regular business hours. The customer support group tracks customer inquiries, and this data is used to help improve the development and
production processes.

Publishing Activities

Marketing

Our marketing efforts include online activities (such as the creation of World Wide Web pages to promote specific titles), public relations, print and broadcast
advertising, coordinated in-store and industry promotions including merchandising and point of purchase displays, participation in cooperative advertising programs, direct response
vehicles, and product sampling through demonstration software distributed through the Internet or on compact discs. From time to time, we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers and
retailers in connection with their own promotional efforts. In addition, our products contain software that enables customers to "electronically register" their purchases with us online.

We
believe that certain of our franchise properties have loyal and devoted audiences who purchase our sequels as a result of dedication to the property and satisfaction from previous
product purchases. Marketing of these sequels is therefore directed both toward the established market as well as broader audiences. In addition, in marketing titles based on licensed properties, we
believe that we derive benefits from the marketing and promotional activities of the property owners.

Sales and Distribution

Domestic.

Our products are available for sale or rental in thousands of retail outlets domestically. Our domestic customers
include Best Buy, Blockbuster, Circuit City, Electronic Boutique, GameStop, Kaybee Toys, Target, Toys "R" Us and Wal-Mart. Our two largest customers, Wal-Mart and Toys "R" Us,
accounted for approximately 14% and 7%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2002. Our five largest retailers, including Wal-Mart and Toys "R" Us, accounted for
approximately 35% of our consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2002. Wal-Mart and Toys "R" Us accounted for approximately 10% and 9%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues for
fiscal 2001. Our five


largest retailers, including Wal-Mart and Toys "R" Us, accounted for approximately 34% of our consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2001.

In
the United States, our products are sold primarily on a direct basis to major computer and software retailing organizations, mass market retailers, consumer electronic stores and
discount warehouses and mail order companies. We believe that a direct relationship with retail accounts results in more effective inventory management, merchandising and communications than would be
possible through indirect relationships. We have implemented electronic data interchange linkages with many of our retailers to facilitate the placing and shipping of orders. We seek to continue to
increase the number of retail outlets reached directly through our internal sales force. We sell our products to distributors, such as Ingram Entertainment, for distribution to independent channels.

International.

We conduct our international publishing activities through offices in the United Kingdom, Germany, France,
Canada, Sweden, Australia, and Japan. We seek to maximize our worldwide revenues and profits by releasing high quality foreign language releases concurrently with English language releases, whenever
practicable, and by continuing to expand the number of direct selling relationships we maintain with key retailers in major territories. We sell directly to large retailers and retail chains in the
United Kingdom and Europe. We also sell through third party distributors in these territories and throughout the world.

Affiliate Labels.

In addition to our own products, we distribute interactive entertainment products that are developed and
marketed by other third party publishers through our "affiliate label" programs in North America and Europe. The distribution of other publishers' products allows us to increase the efficiencies of
our sales force and provides us with the ability to better ensure adequate shelf presence at retail stores for all of the products that we distribute. We also mitigate the risk associated with a
particular title or titles published by us failing to achieve expectations. Services provided by us under our affiliate label program include order solicitation, in-store marketing,
logistics and order fulfillment, sales channel management, as well as other accounting and general administrative functions. Our current affiliate label partner is Lucas Arts. Each affiliate label
relationship is unique and may pertain only to distribution in certain geographic territories such as the United States or Europe and may be further limited only to specific titles or titles for
specific platforms.

Distribution

We distribute interactive entertainment hardware and software products in Europe through our European distribution subsidiaries, CentreSoft in the United Kingdom,
NBG in Germany and CD Contact in the Benelux territories. These subsidiaries act as wholesalers in the distribution of products and also provide packaging, logistical and sales services and, in some
cases, product localization for certain vendors. They provide services to our publishing operations and to various third party publishers, including Sony and Nintendo. CentreSoft is Sony's exclusive
distributor of PlayStation products to the independent channel in the United Kingdom. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002, sales for Sony and Nintendo accounted for approximately 34% and
8%, respectively, of our worldwide net distribution revenues.

We
acquired CentreSoft and NBG in 1997 and CD Contact in 1998. We entered into the distribution business to obtain distribution capacity in Europe for our own products, while at the same
time supporting the distribution infrastructure with third party sales, and in order to diversify our operations into the European market. CentreSoft and our other distribution subsidiaries operate in
accordance with strict confidentiality procedures in order to provide independent services to various third party publishers.


Online, Broadband and Wireless Technologies

We believe that there will be opportunities for further exploitation of titles through the Internet, online services, hand held and other wireless devices and
dedicated Internet online gaming services as platform standards evolve and become more accepted. We are actively exploring the establishment of online game playing opportunities and Internet and
wireless services as a method for realizing additional revenue from our products and as an additional platform for our products. We also plan to develop online components for products developed for
next generation consoles that support online play. Many of our products released for the personal computer contain multi-player gaming capabilities. We released an online version of

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3

on the PS2 platform. We have licensed rights to various text-based computer games in our library for hand held
wireless devices. We believe that many of our other properties may have the potential to be exploited as wireless and online technologies evolve.

Manufacturing

We prepare a set of master program copies, documentation and packaging materials for our products for each respective hardware platform on which the product will
be released. Except with respect to products for use on the Sony and Nintendo systems, our disk duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly and shipping are performed by
third party subcontractors.

In
order to maintain protection over their hardware technologies, Sony and Nintendo generally specify or control the manufacturing and assembly of finished products. We deliver the
master materials to the licensor or its approved replicator, which then manufactures finished goods and delivers them to us for distribution under our label. At the time our product unit orders are
filled by the manufacturer, we become responsible for the costs of manufacturing and the applicable per unit royalty on such units, even if the units do not ultimately sell.

To
date, we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the manufacture and assembly of our products or material returns due to product defects.

Competition

The interactive entertainment industry is intensely competitive. The availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in this
industry primarily as a result of the escalating development, acquisition, production and marketing budgets required to publish quality titles. In addition, competitors with large product lines and
popular titles typically have greater leverage with retailers, distributors and other customers who may be willing to promote titles with less consumer appeal in return for access to such competitor's
most popular titles.

Employees

As of March 31, 2002, we had 1,034 employees, including 467 in product development, 97 in North American publishing, 87 in international publishing, 107 in
operations, corporate finance and administration, and 276 in European distribution activities.

As
of March 31, 2002, approximately 160 of our full-time employees were subject to term employment agreements with us. These agreements generally commit such employees
to employment terms of between one and three years from the commencement of their respective agreements. Most of the employees subject to such agreements are executives or members of the product
development, sales or marketing divisions. These individuals perform services for us as executives, directors, producers,
associate producers, computer programmers, game designers, sales directors and marketing product managers. The execution by us of employment agreements with such employees, in our experience,


reduces our turnover during the development and production of our entertainment software products and allows us to plan more effectively for future development activities.

None
of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have not experienced any labor-related work stoppages.

Dividends

We
paid no cash dividends in 2002 or 2001 and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends at any time in the foreseeable future. We expect that earnings will be retained for the continued
growth and development of the business. In addition, our bank credit facility currently prohibits us from paying cash dividends on our common stock. Future dividends, if any, will depend upon our
earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.

Stock
Split

In
October 2001, the Board of Directors approved a three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. The stock split was paid at the
close of business on November 20, 2001 to shareholders of record as of November 6, 2001. All share and per share data included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has
been restated as if the stock split had occurred as of the earliest period presented.

Sales
of Unregistered Equity Securities

On
December 30, 1999, we issued 115,547 shares of our common stock to acquire a 40% interest in the outstanding capital stock of Gray Matter Interactive Studios, Inc.,
formerly known as Video Games West, ("Gray Matter"), a privately held software development company, as well as an option to purchase the remaining 60% of outstanding capital stock. Effective
January 9, 2002, we exercised our
option to acquire the remaining 60% of outstanding capital stock of Gray Matter in exchange for 133,690 shares of our common stock.

Effective
October 1, 2001, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests of Treyarch Invention, LLC ("Treyarch"), a privately held interactive software development
company, in exchange for 818,961 shares of our common stock. Additional shares of our common stock also may be issued to Treyarch's equity holders and employees over the course of several years,
depending on the satisfaction of certain product performance requirements and other criteria.


On
March 27, 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests of Shaba Games, LLC ("Shaba"), a privately held interactive software development company, in exchange for
258,621 shares of our common stock. Additional shares of our common stock also may be issued to Shaba's equity holders and employees over the course of several years, depending on the satisfaction of
certain product performance requirements and other criteria.

None
of the shares were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), by reason of the exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. We
subsequently registered the shares issued in connection with the Gray Matter, Treyarch and Shaba transactions for resale by the holders thereof.

Repurchase
Plan

As
of May 9, 2000, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $15.0 million of our common stock as well as our convertible subordinated notes. The shares and
notes could be purchased from time to time through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During the year ended March 31, 2001, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of our
common stock for approximately $15.0 million. We financed the purchase of such shares with available cash.

Shareholders'
Rights Plan

On
April 18, 2000, our Board of Directors approved a shareholders rights plan (the "Rights Plan"). Under the Rights Plan, each common shareholder at the close of business on
April 19, 2000 received a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held. Each right represents the right to purchase one one-hundredth (1/100) of a share of our
Series A Junior Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $40.00. Initially, the rights are represented by our common stock certificates and are neither exercisable nor traded separately from our
common stock. The rights will only become exercisable if a person or
group acquires 15% or more of the common stock of Activision, or announces or commences a tender or exchange offer which would result in the bidder's beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common
stock.

In
the event that any person or group acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, each holder of a right (other than such person or members of such group) will thereafter have
the right to receive upon exercise of such right, in lieu of shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock, the number of shares of common stock of Activision having a value equal to two times the
then current exercise price of the right. If we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person has acquired 15% or more of our common stock, each holder of a right
will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such right a number of the acquiring company's common shares having a market value equal to two times the then current exercise price of the
right. For persons who, as of the close of business on April 18, 2000, beneficially own 15% or more of the common stock of Activision, the Rights Plan "grandfathers" their current level of
ownership, so long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of certain limitations.

We
may redeem the rights for $.01 per right at any time until the first public announcement of the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 15% of our common stock. At any time after a
person has acquired 15% or more (but before any person has acquired more than 50%) of our common stock, we may exchange all or part of the rights for shares of common stock at an exchange ratio of one
share of common stock per right. The rights expire on April 18, 2010.

Consolidated
financial information for fiscal years 2001 - 1998 has been restated for the effect of our three-for-two stock split
effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend to shareholders of record as of November 6, 2001, paid November 20, 2001.

Effective
April 1, 2001, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangibles." SFAS No. 142
addresses financial accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and should
not be amortized but rather tested at least annually for impairment. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we have not amortized goodwill during the year ended March 31, 2002. See
Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

(3)

EBITDA
represents income (loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and goodwill. We believe that EBITDA provides useful
information regarding our ability to service our debt; however, EBITDA does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered
as a substitute for net income (loss), as an indicator of our operating performance or cash flow as a measure of liquidity.


Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We are a leading international publisher of interactive entertainment software products. We have built a company with a diverse portfolio of products that spans a
wide range of categories and target markets and that is used on a variety of game hardware platforms and operating systems. We have created, licensed and acquired a group of highly recognizable brands
which we market to a growing variety of consumer demographics.

Our
products cover the action, adventure, action-sports, racing, role-playing, simulation and strategy game categories. Historically, we have offered our products in versions
that operate on the Sony PlayStation ("PS1"), Sony PlayStation 2 ("PS2"), Nintendo 64 ("N64"), Nintendo GameCube ("GameCube") and Microsoft Xbox ("Xbox") console systems, Nintendo Game Boy Advance
("GBA") and Game Boy Color ("GBC") hand held devices, as well as on personal computers ("PC"). Driven partly by the enhanced capabilities of the next generation of platforms, we believe that in the
next few years there will be significant growth in the market for interactive entertainment software and we plan to leverage our skills, experience and resources to extend our leading position in the
industry.

Our
publishing business involves the development, marketing and sale of products, either directly, by license or through our affiliate label program with third party publishers. In the
United States, our products are sold primarily on a direct basis to major computer and software retailing organizations, mass market retailers, consumer electronic stores, discount warehouses and mail
order companies. We conduct our international publishing activities through offices in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Australia, Sweden, Canada and Japan. Our products are sold internationally
on a direct to retail basis and through third party distribution and licensing arrangements and through our wholly-owned distribution subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and
Germany. In addition to publishing, we maintain distribution operations in Europe that provide logistical and sales services to third party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own
publishing operations and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Our
profitability is directly affected by the mix of revenues from our publishing and distribution segments. Publishing operating margins are substantially higher than margins realized
from our distribution segment. Operating margins in our distribution segment are also affected by the mix of hardware and software sales, with software producing higher margins than hardware.

Critical Accounting Policies

We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial results. The impact and any associated risks
related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our
reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our
customers. We may permit product returns from or grant price protection to our customers on unsold merchandise under certain conditions. Price protection policies, when granted and applicable, allow
customers a credit against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise


unsold by them. With respect to license agreements that provide customers the right to make multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenue is recognized upon delivery of such copies. Per
copy royalties on sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned. In addition, in order to recognize revenue for both product sales and licensing transactions, persuasive evidence of an
arrangement must exist and collection of the related receivable must be probable. Revenue recognition also determines the timing of certain expenses, including cost of sales—intellectual
property licenses and cost of sales—software royalties and amortization.

Allowances for Returns, Price Protection, Doubtful Accounts and Inventory Obsolescence.

We may permit product returns from or grant price
protection to our customers under certain conditions. The conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or price protection are, among other things, compliance with
applicable payment terms, delivery to us of weekly inventory and sell-through reports, and consistent participation in the launches of our premium title releases. We may also consider
other factors, including the facilitation of slow moving inventory and other market factors. Management must make estimates of potential future product returns and price protection related to current
period product revenue. Revenue from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection. We estimate the amount of future returns and price protection
based upon historical experience, customer inventory levels, current economic trends and changes in the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer. Significant management judgments and
estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the
allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or
utilized different estimates.

Similarly,
management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable. In estimating allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customers' payment terms and their economic condition. Any significant changes in any of these criteria would
impact management's estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts.

We
value inventory at the lower of cost or market. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and in the retail channel and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory
based on the future expected demand for our products. Significant changes in demand for our products would impact management's estimates in establishing our inventory provision.

Software Development Costs.

Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under
development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for the internal development of products.

We
account for software development costs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be
Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed." Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable. For
products where proven game engine technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Technological feasibility is evaluated on a product-by-product basis. Prior
to a product's release, we expense, as part of product development costs, capitalized costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable. Amounts related to software development which are not
capitalized are charged immediately to product development expense.

We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis. The following criteria is used to evaluate recoverability of software development costs: historical
performance of comparable products; the commercial acceptance of prior products released on a given game engine; orders for the product prior to its release; estimated performance of a sequel product
based on the


performance of the product on which the sequel is based; and actual development costs of a product as compared to our budgeted amount.

Commencing
upon product release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of sales—software royalties and amortization based on the ratio of current
revenues to total projected revenues, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months or less. For products that have
been released in prior periods, we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis. The primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance.

Significant
management judgment and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established, as well as in the ongoing assessment of the recoverability
of capitalized costs.

Intellectual Property Licenses.

Intellectual property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property
rights holders for use of their trademarks or copyrights in the development of our products.

We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis. The recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs is evaluated based on the
expected performance of the specific products in which the licensed trademark or copyright is used. The following criteria is used to evaluate expected product performance: historical performance of
comparable products; the commercial acceptance of prior products released on a given game engine; orders for the product prior to its release; estimated performance of a sequel product based on the
performance of the product on which the sequel is based; and actual development costs of a product as compared to our budgeted amount.

Commencing
upon the related product's release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost of sales—intellectual property licenses based on the
ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues. For products that have been released, we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis. The primary evaluation
criterion is actual title performance.

Significant
management judgment and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs.

Results of Operations—Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2002 and 2001

Net income for fiscal year 2002 was $52.2 million or $0.88 per diluted share, as compared to $20.5 million or $0.50 per diluted share in fiscal year
2001.

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002 increased 27% from the prior fiscal year, from $620.2 million to $786.4 million. This increase
was driven by the performance of both our publishing segment and our distribution segment.

Publishing
net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002 increased 18% from $466.1 million to $549.5 million. This increase primarily was due to publishing console
net revenues increasing 24% from $349.5 million to $432.2 million. The increase in publishing console net revenues was attributable to the release in fiscal 2002 of several titles for
next generation platforms that sold very well in both the domestic and international marketplaces, as well as continuing strong worldwide sales for titles released on existing platforms. Such titles
included

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3

for PS2, GameCube and PS1,

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2

for GBA, N64 and
PS1,

Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions

for Xbox, as well as

Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX

for PS1, GBA and GBC. A
significant portion of our revenues is derived from products based on a relatively small number of popular brands each year. In fiscal 2002, 50% of our worldwide net publishing revenues (35% of
consolidated net revenues) was derived from two brands, one of which accounted for 44% and the other of which accounted for 6% of worldwide net publishing revenues (31% and 4%, respectively, of
consolidated net revenues). In fiscal 2001, two brands accounted for 49% of our worldwide net publishing revenues (37% of consolidated net revenues), one of which accounted for 39% and the other of
which accounted for 10% of worldwide net publishing revenues (29% and 8%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues). We expect that a limited number of popular brands will continue to produce a
disproportionately large amount of our revenues. In fiscal 2002, 56% of publishing console net revenues were derived from sales of titles for next generation platforms while 44% were derived from
sales of titles for existing platforms. When new console platforms are announced or introduced into the market, consumers typically reduce their purchases of game console entertainment software
products for current console platforms in anticipation of new platforms becoming available. We expect sales from existing generation platform titles to decline and sales from next generation platform
titles to increase as the installed base of next generation platforms grows. Publishing PC net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002 remained relatively consistent with the prior year,
increasing from $116.5 million to $117.3 million. Our PC business was flat primarily due to the fact that, despite the successful launch of

Return to Castle
Wolfenstein

for the PC in the third quarter of fiscal 2002, there was a lower number of premium PC titles released in the year ended March 31, 2002, as compared to the
year ended March 31, 2001.

Distribution
net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002 increased 54% from the prior fiscal year, from $154.1 million to $236.9 million, primarily driven by an
increase in our distribution console net revenues. Distribution console net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002 increased 77% over the prior fiscal year, from $117.4 million to
$207.6 million. We are the sole distributor of Sony products in the independent channel in the United Kingdom ("UK"). Accordingly, we benefited from the price
reduction on PS2 hardware that was effective September 2001, as this resulted in both an increase in sales of PS2 hardware, as well as an increase in sales of PS2 software due to the
corresponding larger installed hardware base. Additionally, in fiscal 2002, we began distributing Nintendo products within the UK. These items, along with the improved market conditions in Europe,
have resulted in the continued improvements in our distribution business.

Domestic
net revenues grew 15% from $352.9 million to $404.9 million. International net revenues increased by 43% from $267.3 million to $381.5 million. The
increase in domestic net revenues is reflective of the improvements in our publishing segment as described above, and the increase in


international net revenues is reflective of the improvements in our publishing and distribution segments as described above.

Costs and Expenses

Cost of sales—product costs represented 56% and 52% of consolidated net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
increase in cost of sales—product costs as a percentage of consolidated net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002 was due to the increase in distribution net revenues as a
percentage of total consolidated net revenues, as well as a change in the product mix of our publishing business. Distribution net revenues have a higher per unit cost as compared to publishing net
revenues. The product mix of our publishing business for the year ended March 31, 2002 reflects a heavier concentration of console products and hand held devices. Console products generally
have a higher manufacturing per unit cost than PCs. Hand held devices generally have the highest manufacturing per unit cost of all platforms.

Cost
of sales—intellectual property licenses decreased as a percentage of publishing net revenues to 7% for the year ended March 31, 2002, from 9% for the year ended
March 31, 2001. The decrease is reflective of the fact that in the year ended March 31, 2001, several of our top performing titles were products with high intellectual property royalty
rates.

Cost
of sales—software royalties and amortization remained flat at 11% of publishing net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001.

Product
development expenses of $41.0 million and $41.4 million represented 7% and 9% of publishing net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The decrease in product development expenses as a percentage of publishing net revenue is reflective of the fact that during the year ended March 31, 2002, a higher proportion of
product development expenditures were incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility as compared to the prior fiscal year in which more product development expenditures were
incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility and were, accordingly, charged directly to product development expense. In
addition, our "Greenlight Process" for the selection, development, production and quality assurance of our products has exercised rigorous control over product development expenditures.

Sales
and marketing expenses of $86.2 million and $85.4 million represented 11% and 14% of consolidated net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. This decrease as a percentage of consolidated net revenues reflects our ability to generate savings by building on the existing awareness of our branded products and sequel titles sold
during fiscal 2002. It also reflects the savings we receive from the increased success of releasing a higher proportion of our branded products simultaneously on multiple platforms.

General
and administrative expense for the year ended March 31, 2002, increased 17%, from $37.5 million to $44.0 million. As a percentage of consolidated net
revenues, general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at approximately 6%. The increase in the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses was due to an increase in
worldwide administrative support needs and headcount related expenses.

Amortization
of intangibles decreased from $1.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2001 to zero for the year ended March 31, 2002. Effective April 1, 2001,
we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangibles." SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and other
intangible assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and should not be amortized but rather tested at least annually for impairment. As such, we did not
record goodwill amortization for the year ended March 31, 2002.


Operating Income

Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2002, was $80.6 million, compared to $39.8 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase in
operating income for the year ended March 31, 2002 over the prior fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the success of our publishing business due to branding, cross platform releases
and operating efficiencies obtained via the leveraging of our infrastructure and, to a lesser degree, an increase in our distribution business resulting from the growth of the next generation hardware
and software markets.

Interest Income (Expense), Net

Interest income (expense), net changed to $2.5 million of interest income for the year ended March 31, 2002, from $(7.3) million of interest expense
for the year ended March 31, 2001. This change was due to
our improved cash position resulting in higher investment income, the elimination of bank borrowings and the conversion and/or redemption of our $60.0 million convertible subordinated notes in
the first quarter of fiscal 2002.

Provision for Income Taxes

The income tax provision of $30.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2002, reflects our effective income tax rate of approximately 37%. The
significant items generating the variance between our effective rate and our statutory rate of 35% are state taxes and an increase in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance which is partially
offset by research and development tax credits and the impact of foreign tax rate differentials. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income.
Management believes that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of net deferred tax assets recognized.

Results of Operations—Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2001 and 2000

Net income (loss) for fiscal year 2001 was $20.5 million or $0.50 per diluted share, as compared to net loss of $(34.1) million or $(0.92) per diluted
share in fiscal year 2000. The 2000 results were negatively impacted by a strategic restructuring charge totaling $70.2 million, approximately $61.8 million net of tax, or $(1.67) per
diluted share.

Strategic Restructuring Plan

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we finalized a strategic restructuring plan to accelerate the development and sale of interactive entertainment products for
the next generation consoles and the Internet. Costs associated with this plan amounted to $70.2 million, approximately $61.8 million net of taxes, and were recorded in the consolidated
statement of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000 and classified as follows (amounts in millions):

The component of the charge included in amortization of intangible assets represented a write down of intangibles including goodwill, relating to
Expert Software, Inc. ("Expert"), one of our value publishing subsidiaries, totaling $26.3 million. We consolidated Expert into our Head Games subsidiary, forming one integrated business
unit, Activision Value Publishing, Inc. As part of this consolidation, we discontinued substantially all of Expert's product lines, terminated substantially all of Expert's employees and phased
out the use of the Expert name. In addition, a $10.9 million write down of goodwill relating to TDC, an OEM business unit, was recorded. During fiscal 2000, the OEM market went through radical
changes due to price declines of PCs and hardware accessories. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flow of these assets was not sufficient to cover the carrying value of these assets and as such
was written down to fair market value.


The component of the charge included in net revenues and general and administrative expense represents costs associated with the planned termination of a substantial number of our third
party distributor relationships in connection with our realignment of our worldwide publishing business to leverage our existing sales and marketing organizations and improve the control and
management of our products. These actions resulted in an increase in the allowance for sales returns of $11.7 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.4 million. The plan
also included a severance charge of $1.2 million for employee redundancies.

The
components of the $11.9 million charge included in cost of sales included the write-down of capitalized software costs and licensor warrants granted in connection
with the development of software and the acquisition of licensing rights for intellectual property. The product lines to which these write-downs related, for example Heavy Gear, Interstate 82 and
Battlezone, were strictly PC lines that appealed primarily to a smaller subset of gaming enthusiasts. Based upon the growth of the console market and the upcoming release of the next generation
console platforms, we determined not to exploit these titles going forward as we did not believe that they would have a viable future with the next generation platforms. Of the $11.9 million
charge, approximately $8.6 million was related to future releases of products and approximately $3.3 million was related to the cessation of certain existing product lines.

During
fiscal 2001, we completed the restructuring initiatives associated with the fiscal 2000 restructuring plan without any significant adjustments.

Net Revenues

Net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2001 increased 8% from the prior fiscal year, from $572.2 million to $620.2 million. This increase
was driven by the performance of our publishing segment, partially offset by declines experienced in our distribution segment.

Publishing
net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2001 increased 17% from $396.7 million to $466.1 million. This increase primarily was due to publishing console
net revenues increasing 24% from $281.2 million to $349.5 million. The increase in publishing console net revenues was attributable to the release in fiscal 2001 of several titles that
sold very well in the marketplace, including

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2

(PS1, Sega Dreamcast and GBC),

Spiderman

(PS1, N64 and GBC),

X-Men Mutant Academy


(PS1 and GBC), as well as continuing strong sales of the original

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater

(PS1 and N64). Publishing PC net revenues for the year ended
March 31, 2001 remained relatively constant with the prior year, increasing from $115.5 million to $116.5 million.

For
the year ended March 31, 2001, distribution net revenues decreased 12% from prior fiscal year from $175.5 million to $154.1 million. The decrease was mainly
attributable to the continued weakness in the European console market as a result of the transition to next generation console systems. Based on previous new hardware launches, we expect that our
distribution business will benefit in future periods from the introduction of PS2 and other next generation consoles. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, distribution had its best results in eight
quarters, reflecting the accelerating opportunities from the introduction of new console systems.

Domestic
net revenues grew 25% from $282.8 million to $352.9 million. International net revenues decreased by 8% from $289.4 million to $267.3 million. The
increase in domestic net revenues is reflective of the increases in our publishing segment as described above and the decrease in international net revenues is reflective of the declines in our
distribution segment as described above.

Costs and Expenses

Cost of sales—product costs represented 52% and 56% of consolidated net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
decrease in cost of sales—product costs as a percentage of consolidated net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2001 was due to the decrease in distribution net revenues,
partially offset by a higher publishing console net revenue mix. Distribution products have a higher per unit product cost than publishing products, and console products have a higher per unit product
cost than PC products.

Cost
of sales—intellectual property licenses and cost of sales—software royalties and amortization, combined, represented 19% and 23% of publishing net revenues
for the year ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in cost of sales—intellectual property licenses and cost of sales—software royalties and
amortization, combined, as a percentage of publishing net revenues is reflective of the $11.9 million of write-offs recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 relating to our
restructuring plan as previously described.

Product
development expenses of $41.4 million and $26.3 million represented 9% and 7% of publishing net revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. These increases in product development expenses in dollars and as a percentage of publishing net revenues reflect our investment in the development of products for next generation
console and hand held devices, including PS2, Xbox, GameCube and GBA. The increases are also reflective of the increase in the number of titles expected to be released in fiscal 2002, 52 titles,
compared to fiscal 2001, 35 titles. Of the 52 titles expected to be released in fiscal 2002, 19 titles are for next generation platforms, which have higher development costs than existing platform
titles.

Sales
and marketing expenses of $85.4 million and $87.3 million represented 14% and 15% of consolidated net revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively. This decrease reflects our ability to generate savings by building on the existing awareness of our branded products and sequel titles sold during fiscal 2001.

General
and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2001 remained constant with the prior fiscal year, increasing 2% from $36.7 million to
$37.5 million. As a percentage of consolidated net revenues, fiscal 2001 general and administrative expenses also remained relatively constant with the prior fiscal year at approximately 6%.

Amortization
of intangibles decreased substantially from $41.6 million in fiscal 2000 to $1.5 million in fiscal 2001. This was due to the write-off in fiscal
2000 of goodwill acquired in purchase acquisitions in conjunction with our restructuring plan as previously described.


Operating Income (Loss)

Operating income (loss) for the year ended March 31, 2001, was $39.8 million, compared to $(30.3) million in fiscal 2000. This increase in
consolidated operating income is primarily the result of increased operating income in our publishing business.

Publishing
operating income (loss) for the year ended March 31, 2001 increased to $35.7 million, compared to $(35.0) million in the prior fiscal year. The increase reflects
the charges incurred in fiscal 2000 in conjunction with our restructuring plan as previously described, which predominantly impacted our publishing segment. Distribution operating income for the year
ended March 31, 2001 remained flat at $4.1 million, compared to $4.7 million in the prior fiscal year.

Interest Income (Expense), Net

Interest income (expense), net decreased to $(7.3) million for the year ended March 31, 2001, from $(8.4) million for the year ended March 31, 2000.
This decrease in interest expense was due to lower average borrowings on the revolving portion of our $125.0 million term loan and revolving credit facility (the "U.S. Facility") during fiscal
2001 when compared to prior fiscal year, as well as increased interest earned as a result of higher investable cash balances throughout the year.

Provision for Income Taxes

The income tax provision of $12.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, reflects our effective income tax rate of approximately 37%. The
significant items generating the variance between our effective rate and our statutory rate of 35% are state taxes and nondeductible goodwill amortization, partially offset by a decrease in our
deferred tax asset valuation allowance and research and development tax credits. The realization of deferred tax assets primarily is dependent on the generation of future taxable income. Management
believes that it is more likely than not that we will generate taxable income sufficient to realize the benefit of net deferred tax assets recognized.

Quarterly Operating Results

Our quarterly operating results have in the past varied significantly and will likely vary significantly in the future, depending on numerous factors, several of
which are not under our control. See Item 1 "Business—Factors Affecting Future Performance." Our business also has experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant
seasonality, in part due to consumer buying patterns. Net revenues typically are significantly higher during the fourth calendar quarter, primarily due to the increased demand for consumer software
during the year-end holiday buying season. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and
should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our cash and cash equivalents were $279.0 million at March 31, 2002 compared to $125.6 million at March 31, 2001. This
$153.4 million increase in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended March 31, 2002, resulted from $111.8 million and $50.4 million provided by operating and financing
activities, respectively, offset by $8.7 million utilized in investing activities. The principle components comprising cash flows from operating activities included favorable operating results,
tax benefits from stock option and warrant exercises and reductions in inventory levels, partially offset by our continued investment in software development and intellectual property licenses.
Approximately $77.0 million was utilized in fiscal 2002 in connection with the acquisition of publishing or distribution rights to products being developed by third parties, the execution of
new license agreements granting us long-term rights to intellectual property of third parties, as well as the capitalization of product development costs relating to internally developed
products. The cash used in investing activities primarily was the result of equipment purchases. The cash provided by financing activities primarily was the result of proceeds from the issuance of
common stock pursuant to employee stock option and stock purchase plans and common stock warrants, offset by the accelerated repayment of our term loan.

In
connection with our purchases of Nintendo 64, Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy hardware and software cartridges for distribution in North America and Europe, Nintendo requires us to
provide either irrevocable or standby letters of credit prior to accepting purchase orders. Furthermore, Nintendo maintains a policy of not accepting returns of Nintendo 64, Nintendo GameCube or Game
Boy hardware and software cartridges. Because of these and other factors, the carrying of an inventory of Nintendo 64, Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy hardware and software cartridges entails
significant capital and risk. As of March 31, 2002, we had approximately $1.0 million of Nintendo 64 and Nintendo GameCube and $5.9 million of Game Boy hardware and software
cartridge inventory on hand, which represented approximately 5% and 29%, respectively, of all inventory.

In
December 1997, we completed the private placement of $60.0 million principal amount of 6


/


% convertible subordinated notes due 2005 (the "Notes"). During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002, we
called for the redemption of the Notes. In connection with that call, holders converted to common stock approximately $58.7 million aggregate principal amount of their Notes, net of conversion
costs. The remaining Notes were redeemed for cash.


In
June 1999, we obtained a $100.0 million revolving credit facility and a $25.0 million term loan with a syndicate of banks (the "U.S. Facility"). The revolving
portion of the U.S. Facility provided us with the ability to borrow up to $100.0 million, including issuing letters of credit up to $80 million, on a revolving basis against eligible
accounts receivable and inventory. The term loan had a three-year term with principal amortization on a straight-line quarterly basis beginning December 31, 1999, a
borrowing rate based on the banks' base rate (which is generally equivalent to the published prime rate) plus 2% or LIBOR plus 3% and was to expire June 2002. The revolving portion of the U.S
Facility had a borrowing rate based on the banks' base rate plus 1.75% or LIBOR plus 2.75%. In May 2001, we accelerated our repayment of the outstanding balance under the term loan portion of
the U.S. Facility. In connection with the accelerated repayment, we amended the U.S. Facility (the "Amended and Restated U.S. Facility"). The Amended and Restated U.S. Facility eliminated the term
loan, reduced the revolver to $78.0 million and reduced the interest rate to the banks' base rate plus 1.25% or LIBOR plus 2.25%. We pay a commitment fee of


/


% on the unused
portion of the revolver. The Amended and Restated U.S. Facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and was scheduled to expire in June 2002. However, in June 2002, we
obtained an extension of the maturity date for the Amended and Restated U.S. Facility to August 2002. The Amended and Restated U.S. Facility contains various covenants that limit our ability to
incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions, create certain liens, sell assets, or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions. We are also required to maintain specified
financial ratios related to net worth and fixed charges. We were in compliance with these covenants as of March 31, 2002. As of March 31, 2002, there were no borrowings and
$5.8 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Amended and Restated U.S. Facility.

We
are currently in negotiations with several lenders, including our existing lenders, regarding our future bank financing. Our current intentions are to reduce our revolving credit
facility to $50.0 million due to our improved cash position and reduced financing requirements.

We
have a revolving credit facility through our CD Contact subsidiary in the Netherlands (the "Netherlands Facility"). The Netherlands Facility permits revolving credit loans and letters
of credit up to Euro dollars ("EUR") 4.5 million ($3.9 million) as of March 31, 2002, based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances. The Netherlands Facility is
due on demand, bears interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus 1.50% and expires August 2003. There were no borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the Netherlands Facility as of
March 31, 2002.

We
also have revolving credit facilities with our CentreSoft subsidiary located in the United Kingdom (the "UK Facility") and our NBG subsidiary located in Germany (the "German
Facility"). The UK Facility provides for British Pounds ("GBP") 7.0 million ($10.0 million) of revolving loans and GBP 1.5 million ($2.1 million) of letters of credit as of
March 31, 2002. The UK Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 2%, is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and expires in
October 2002. The UK Facility also contains various covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios related to, among others, fixed charges. As of March 31,
2002, we were in compliance with these covenants. No borrowings were outstanding against the UK facility as of March 31, 2002. Letters of credit of GBP 1.5 million ($2.1 million)
were outstanding against the UK Facility as of March 31, 2002. As of March 31, 2002, the German Facility provides for revolving loans up to EUR 2.5 million ($2.2 million),
bears interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus 2.5%, is collateralized by a cash deposit of approximately GBP 650,000 ($926,000) made by our CentreSoft subsidiary and has no expiration date. There were no
borrowings outstanding against the German Facility as of March 31, 2002.

In
the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for the development of products, as well as for the rights to intellectual property ("IP").
Under these agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a developer or IP holder, based upon contractual arrangements. Assuming all contractual provisions are met, the total future minimum


contract commitment for contracts in place as of March 31, 2002 is approximately $63.7 million and is scheduled to be distributed as follows (amounts in thousands):

We
have historically financed our acquisitions through the issuance of shares of common stock. As described in Item 1 "Business—Business Combinations," during fiscal 2002, we
separately completed the acquisition of three privately held interactive software development companies for common stock. We additionally acquired a fourth privately held interactive software
development company in May 2002 for the issuance of a combination of cash and common stock. We will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates as to the benefit they bring to us and
as to our ability to make such acquisitions.

On
December 4, 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register 7,500,000 shares of our common
stock. On June 4, 2002, we issued the 7,500,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering for proceeds, before issuance costs, of approximately $248.3 million. The
proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, additions to working capital and financing of capital expenditures, joint ventures and/or
strategic acquisitions.

We
believe that we have sufficient working capital ($333.2 million at March 31, 2002), as well as proceeds available from the Amended and Restated U.S. Facility, the UK
Facility, the Netherlands Facility, the German Facility and our recent equity offering, to finance our operational requirements for at least the next twelve months, including acquisitions of inventory
and equipment, the funding of the development, production, marketing and sale of new products and the acquisition of intellectual property rights for future products from third parties.

Inflation

Our management currently believes that inflation has not had a material impact on continuing operations.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In August 2001, SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" was issued, which supersedes SFAS
No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of," and the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting
Principles Board ("APB") No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations—Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
Occurring Events and Transactions." SFAS No.144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We believe the adoption of SFAS No. 144 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.


Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates
and foreign currency exchange rates. Our market risk sensitive instruments are classified as "other than trading." Our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes "forward-looking statements"
and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. Our views
on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur, since actual gains and losses will differ from
those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and the timing of transactions.

Interest Rate Risk

We have had a number of variable rate and fixed rate debt obligations, denominated both in U.S. dollars and various foreign currencies as detailed in
Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. We manage interest rate risk by monitoring our ratio of fixed and variable rate debt
obligations in view of changing market conditions. Additionally, in the future, we may consider the use of interest rate swap agreements to further manage potential interest rate risk.

As
of March 31, 2001 the carrying value of our variable rate debt was approximately $10.3 million, which included the U.S. Facility ($8.5 million) and the
Netherlands Facility ($1.8 million). As of March 31, 2001, we additionally had 6


/


% convertible subordinated notes due 2005 (the "Notes") with a carrying value of
$60.0 million. During the year ended March 31, 2002, our holdings of market risk sensitive instruments changed. During that year, we called for the redemption of the Notes. In connection
with that call, holders converted to common stock approximately $58.7 million aggregate principal amount of their Notes, net of conversion costs. The remaining Notes were redeemed for cash.
Additionally, in May 2001, we repaid in full the remaining $8.5 million balance of the term loan portion of the U.S. Facility. As such, as of March 31, 2002, we had no variable
rate debt and no material fixed rate debt outstanding.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We transact business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates, particularly GBP and EUR. The volatility of GBP and EUR (and all other applicable currencies) will be monitored frequently throughout the coming year. When appropriate, we enter into hedging
transactions in order to mitigate our risk from foreign currency fluctuations. We will continue to use hedging programs in the future and may use currency forward contracts, currency options and/or
other derivative financial instruments commonly utilized to reduce financial market risks if it is determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk. We do not hold or purchase
any foreign currency contracts for trading purposes. As of March 31, 2002, assuming a change in currency rates of 10% of period end market rates, the potential gain or loss on outstanding
hedging contracts would be approximately $300,000. However any such gain or loss would in turn be offset by the potential gain or loss on the hedged receivable and/or payable.

Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING

AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

We replaced KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as our principal accountant, effective March 20, 2001. The action was recommended by the Audit Committee of our Board of
Directors and was approved by our Board of Directors.

KPMG's
reports on our financial statements for the two most recent years prior to their replacement did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified
or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the two fiscal years and any subsequent interim period preceding the decision not to renew KPMG, (i) there were no
disagreements with KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practice, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG, would
have caused it to make a reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report, and (ii) there were no reportable events as described in Item 304 of
Regulation S-K.

We
engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers") as our principal accountant to audit our financial statements, effective as of March 20, 2001. During the two
fiscal years and three subsequent interim periods prior to engaging PricewaterhouseCoopers, neither we nor anyone on our behalf consulted with PricewaterhouseCoopers regarding the application of
accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral
advice was provided to us by PricewaterhouseCoopers that was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments and accounts receivable. We
place our temporary cash investments with financial institutions. At various times during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001, we had deposits in excess of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") limit at these financial institutions.

Our
customer base includes retail outlets and distributors, including consumer electronics and computer specialty stores, discount chains, video rental stores and toy stores in the
United States and countries worldwide. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses. We generally do not require collateral or other
security from our customers. As of and for the year ended March 31, 2002, we had one customer that accounted for 14% of our consolidated net revenues and 22% of our consolidated accounts
receivable, net. This customer was a customer of both our publishing and distribution businesses. As of and for the year ended March 31, 2001, our publishing business had one customer that
accounted for 10% of our consolidated net revenues and 9% of our consolidated accounts receivable, net. For the year ended March 31, 2000, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of
consolidated net revenues.

Financial Instruments

The estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies described below. However,
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein may not be indicative of the amounts that we could
realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.

The
carrying amounts of our variable rate debt approximate fair value because the interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates. The fair value of
our fixed rate debt is
based on quoted market prices, where available, or discounted future cash flows based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of the balance sheet
date. The carrying amount of our long-term debt and convertible subordinated notes of $13.6 million and $60.0 million, respectively, approximated fair value as of
March 31, 2001. As of March 31, 2002, we had no variable rate debt and no material fixed rate debt outstanding.

Effective
July 1, 2000, we adopted SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an amendment of SFAS 133." SFAS No. 133 and 138 require that all derivatives, including foreign exchange contracts, be recognized in the
balance sheet at their fair value.

We
utilize forward contracts in order to reduce financial market risks. These instruments are used to hedge foreign currency exposures of underlying assets, liabilities, or certain
forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions. Our accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as hedging transactions. Changes in fair
value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, are highly effective, and qualify as hedging instruments, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged item is
recognized in earnings. Any ineffective portion of a derivative change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify as hedging
instruments are recorded in earnings. The fair value of foreign currency contracts is estimated based on the spot rate of the various hedged

F-8

currencies as of the end of the period. As of March 31, 2002, the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts was immaterial.

Equity Investments

From time to time, we may make a capital investment and hold a minority interest in a third party developer in connection with entertainment software products to
be developed by such developer for us. We account for those capital investments in which we have a 20% or greater ownership interest or over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence
using the equity method. For those investments in which we hold less than a 20% ownership interest or over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, we account for our
investment using the cost method.

Software Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses

Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements as well as direct costs incurred for the internal
development of products.

We
account for software development costs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be
Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed." Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable. For
products where proven game engine technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Technological feasibility is evaluated on a product-by-product basis. Prior
to a product's release, we expense, as part of product development costs, capitalized costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable. Amounts related to software development which are not
capitalized are charged immediately to product development expense.

We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis. The following criteria is used to evaluate recoverability of software development costs: historical
performance of comparable products; the commercial acceptance of prior products released on a given game engine; orders for the product prior to its release; estimated performance of a sequel product
based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based; and actual development costs of a product as compared to our budgeted amount.

Commencing
upon product release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of sales—software royalties and amortization based on the ratio of current
revenues to total projected revenues, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months or less. For products that have been released in prior periods, we evaluate the future recoverability
of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis. The primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance.

Intellectual
property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks or copyrights in the development of our products.

We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis. The recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs is
evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products in which the licensed trademark or copyright is used. The following criteria is used to evaluate expected product performance:
historical performance of comparable products; the commercial acceptance of prior products released on a given game engine; orders for the product prior to its release; estimated performance of a
sequel product based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based; and actual development costs of a product as compared to our budgeted amount.

Commencing
upon the related product's release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost of sales—intellectual property licenses based on the
ratio of current revenues to total

F-9

projected revenues. For products that have been released, we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis. The primary evaluation criterion is actual title
performance.

As
of March 31, 2002, capitalized software development costs included $16.0 million of internally generated software development costs and $23.5 million of payments
made to independent software developers. As of March 31, 2001, capitalized software development costs included $3.9 million of internally generated software development costs and
$19.5 million of payments made to independent software developers. Capitalized intellectual property licenses were $17.2 million and $18.8 million as of March 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively. Amortization of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses was $62.5 million, $68.9 million and $78.7 million for the year ended
March 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
estimated useful lives or the lease term: buildings, 25 to 33 years; computer equipment, office furniture and other equipment, 3 to 5 years; leasehold improvements, through the life of
the lease. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed and any resultant gains or losses are recognized in current operations.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers. We may permit product returns from or grant price
protection to our customers on unsold merchandise under certain conditions. Price protection policies, when granted and applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts they owe us with respect to
merchandise unsold by them. With respect to license agreements that provide customers the right to make multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenue is recognized upon delivery of such
copies. Per copy royalties on sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned. In addition, in order to recognize revenue for both product sales and licensing transactions, persuasive
evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection of the related receivable must be probable.

Revenue
from product sales is reflected after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection. Management must make estimates of potential future product returns and
price protection related to current period product revenue. We estimate the amount of future returns and price protection based upon historical experience, customer inventory levels, current economic
trends and changes in the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer.

Shipping and Handling

Shipping and handling costs, which consist primarily of packaging and transportation charges incurred to move finished goods to customers, are included in cost of
sales—product costs.

Advertising Expenses

We expense advertising as incurred. Advertising expenses for the year ended March 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were approximately $18.9 million,
$16.5 million and $18.6 million, respectively, and are included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

F-10

Goodwill

Effective April 1, 2001, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangibles." SFAS No. 142 addresses financial
accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and should not be amortized but
rather tested at least annually for impairment. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of goodwill is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In
accordance with SFAS No. 142, we have not amortized goodwill during the year ended March 31, 2002.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes using SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under SFAS No. 109, income taxes are accounted for under the asset
and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are their local currencies. All assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period, and revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are
reflected as a component of shareholders' equity.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income (loss), foreign currency translation adjustments, and the effective portion of gains or losses on cash flow hedges
that are currently presented as a component
of shareholders' equity. For the years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001, the accumulated other comprehensive loss balance primarily consisted of foreign currency translation adjustments.

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities or the disclosure of gain or loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

F-11

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
all periods. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, increased by common stock
equivalents. Common stock equivalents are calculated using the treasury stock method and represent incremental shares issuable upon exercise of our outstanding options and warrants and, if applicable
in the period, conversion of our convertible debt. However, potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation when inclusion of such shares
would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded.

Stock Based Compensation

Under SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," compensation expense is recorded for the issuance of stock options and other stock-based
compensation based on the fair value of the stock options and other stock-based compensation on the date of grant or measurement date. Alternatively, SFAS No. 123 allows companies to continue
to account for the issuance of stock options and other stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees." Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is recorded for the issuance of stock options and other stock-based compensation based on the intrinsic value of the stock options and other
stock-based compensation on the date of grant or measurement date. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant or measurement date only if the current
market price of the underlying stock exceeds the stock option or other stock-based compensation exercise price. We have elected to continue to account for stock options and other stock-based
compensation in accordance with APB No. 25. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, we provide pro forma net income and pro forma earnings (loss) per share disclosures for
employee stock option and other stock-based compensation grants as if the fair value method as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 had been applied.

Stock
warrants are granted to non-employees in connection with the development of software and acquisition of licensing rights for intellectual property. In accordance with
the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 96-18, "Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring or
in Connection With Selling Goods or Services," the fair value of stock warrants granted is determined as of the measurement date and is capitalized, expensed and amortized consistent with our policies
relating to software development and intellectual property license costs.

Related Parties

As of March 31, 2002 and 2001, we had $3.1 million and $4.3 million, respectively, of loans due from employees. The loans bear interest at
6.75% and are primarily due from Activision executives.

In
August 2001, we elected to our Board of Directors an individual who is a partner in a law firm that has provided legal services to Activision for more than ten years. We paid
approximately $600,000 in fiscal 2002 during the period in which the individual served upon our Board of Directors for legal services rendered by the law firm. Total payments made to this law firm
represent less than 1% of that firm's revenue.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In August 2001, SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" was issued, which supersedes SFAS
No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of," and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB
No. 30,

F-12

"Reporting the Results of Operations—Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions." SFAS
No.144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. We believe the adoption of SFAS No. 144 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation. These reclassifications had no
effect on net income (loss), shareholders' equity or net increase in cash and cash equivalents.

2.

Acquisitions

Fiscal 2002 Transactions

During the year ended March 31, 2002, we separately completed the acquisition of three privately held interactive software development companies. We
accounted for those acquisitions in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." SFAS No. 141 was issued on July 20, 2001 and addresses financial accounting and
reporting for business combinations, requiring that the purchase method be used to account and report for all business combinations. These acquisitions further enable us to implement our
multi-platform development strategy by bolstering our internal product development capabilities for the next generation console systems and personal computers and strengthen our position in the first
person action, action and action-sports genres.

Acquisition of Treyarch

Effective October 1, 2001, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests of Treyarch Invention, LLC ("Treyarch"), a privately held interactive
software development company, in exchange for 818,961 shares of our common stock. Treyarch is a console software developer with a focus on action and action-sports video games. The purchase price of
the transaction, including the forgiveness of a note receivable and acquisition costs, was valued at approximately $15.6 million with approximately $14.5 million of the purchase price
being assigned to goodwill. This goodwill has been included in the publishing segment of our business and is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results of operations of Treyarch are
included in our consolidated statement of operations beginning October 1, 2001.

Additional
shares of our common stock also may be issued to Treyarch's equity holders and employees over the course of several years, depending on the satisfaction of certain product
performance requirements and other criteria. This contingent consideration will be recorded as an additional element of the purchase price for Treyarch when those contingencies are resolved.

Acquisition of Gray Matter

On December 30, 1999, we acquired a 40% interest in the outstanding capital stock of Gray Matter Interactive Studios, Inc., formerly known as Video
Games West ("Gray Matter"), a privately held software development company, as well as an option to purchase the remaining 60% of outstanding capital stock. Gray Matter was the developer for our first
person action PC product,

Return to Castle Wolfenstein.

Effective January 9, 2002, we exercised our option to acquire the remaining 60% of
outstanding capital stock of Gray Matter in exchange for 133,690 shares of our common stock. The purchase price of the transaction, including acquisition costs, was valued at approximately
$3.6 million with a significant portion of the purchase price being assigned to goodwill. This goodwill has been included in the publishing segment of our business and is
non-deductible for tax purposes. The results

F-13

of operations of Gray Matter are included in our consolidated statement of operations beginning January 9, 2002.

Acquisition of Shaba

On March 27, 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests of Shaba Games, LLC ("Shaba"), a privately held interactive software development
company, in exchange for 258,621 shares of our common stock. Shaba is a console software developer with a focus on action and action-sports video games. The purchase price of the transaction,
including acquisition costs, was valued at approximately $7.4 million with approximately $6.2 million of the purchase price being assigned to goodwill. This goodwill has been included in
the publishing segment of our business and is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results of operations of Shaba are included in our consolidated statement of operations beginning
March 27, 2002.

Additional
shares of our common stock also may be issued to Shaba's equity holders and employees over the course of several years, depending on the satisfaction of certain product
performance requirements and other criteria. This contingent consideration will be recorded as an additional element of the purchase price for Shaba when those contingencies are resolved.

A
significant portion of the purchase price for each of these acquisitions was assigned to goodwill as the primary asset we acquired in each transaction was an assembled workforce with
proven technical and design talent with a history of high quality product creation. Pro forma consolidated statements of operations reflecting these acquisitions are not shown, as they would not
differ materially from reported results.

Fiscal 2000 Transactions

Acquisition of Neversoft

On September 30, 1999, we acquired Neversoft, a privately held console software developer, in exchange for 1,048,253 shares of our common stock. The
acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests. Accordingly, in fiscal 2000 we restated the consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to the closing of the transaction.

The
following table represents the results of operations of the previously separate companies for the period before the combination was consummated which are included in fiscal year 2000
combined net income (loss) (amounts in thousands).

Acquisition of Elsinore Multimedia

On June 29, 1999, we acquired Elsinore Multimedia, Inc. ("Elsinore"), a privately held interactive software development company, in exchange for
306,672 shares of our common stock.

The
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of Elsinore have been included in our consolidated financial statements
from the date of acquisition. The aggregate purchase price has been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired, consisting mostly of goodwill of $3.0 million. Pro forma statements of
operations reflecting the acquisition of Elsinore are not shown, as they would not differ materially from reported results.

F-14

Acquisition of Expert Software

On June 22, 1999, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Expert Software, Inc. ("Expert"), a publicly held developer and publisher of
value-line interactive leisure products, for approximately $24.7 million. The aggregate purchase price of approximately $24.7 million consisted of $20.3 million in
cash payable to the former shareholders of Expert, the valuation of employee stock options in the amount of $3.3 million, and other acquisition costs.

The
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of Expert have been included in our consolidated financial statements
from the date of acquisition.

The
aggregate purchase price was allocated to the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired as follows (amounts in thousands):

However,
as more fully described in Note 3, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we implemented a strategic restructuring plan to accelerate the development of games for the next
generation consoles
and the Internet. In conjunction with that plan, we consolidated Expert and our Head Games subsidiary, forming one integrated business unit, Activision Value Publishing, Inc., in the value
software category. As part of this consolidation, we discontinued substantially all of Expert's product lines and terminated substantially all of Expert's employees. In addition, we phased out the use
of the Expert name. As a result of these initiatives, in fiscal 2000 we incurred a nonrecurring charge of $26.3 million resulting from the write-down of intangibles acquired,
including goodwill.

3.

Strategic Restructuring Plan

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, we finalized a strategic restructuring plan to accelerate the development and sale of interactive entertainment products for
the next generation consoles and the Internet. Costs associated with this plan amounted to $70.2 million, approximately $61.8 million net of taxes, and were recorded in the consolidated
statement of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000 and classified as follows (amount in millions):

Net revenues

4.2

General and administrative

5.2

Amortization of intangible assets

37.2

$

70.2

The
component of the charge included in amortization of intangible assets represented a write down of intangibles including goodwill, relating to Expert Software, Inc. ("Expert"),
one of our value publishing subsidiaries, totaling $26.3 million. We consolidated Expert into our Head Games subsidiary, forming one integrated business unit, Activision Value
Publishing, Inc. As part of this consolidation, we discontinued substantially all of Expert's product lines, terminated substantially all of Expert's employees and phased out the use of the
Expert name. In addition, a $10.9 million write down of

F-15

goodwill relating to TDC, an OEM business unit, was recorded. In fiscal 2000, the OEM market went through radical changes due to price declines of PCs and hardware accessories. The sum of the
undiscounted future cash flow of these assets was not sufficient to cover the carrying value of these assets and as such was written down to fair market value.

The
component of the charge included in net revenues and general and administrative expense represents costs associated with the planned termination of a substantial number of our third
party distributor relationships in connection with our realignment of our worldwide publishing business to leverage our existing sales and marketing organizations and improve the control and
management of our products. These actions resulted in an increase in the allowance for sales returns of $11.7 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.4 million. The plan
also included a severance charge of $1.2 million for employee redundancies.

The
components of the $11.9 million charge included in cost of sales included the write-down of capitalized software costs and licensor warrants granted in connection
with the development of software and the acquisition of licensing rights for intellectual property. The product lines to which these write-downs related, for example Heavy Gear, Interstate 82 and
Battlezone, were strictly PC lines that appealed primarily to a smaller subset of gaming enthusiasts. Based upon the growth of the console market and the upcoming release of the next generation
console platforms, we determined not to exploit these titles going forward as we did not believe that they would have a viable future with the next generation platforms. Of the $11.9 million
charge, approximately $8.6 million was related to future releases of products and approximately $3.3 million was related to the cessation of certain existing product lines.

During
fiscal 2001, we completed the restructuring initiatives associated with the fiscal 2000 restructuring plan without any significant adjustments.

Operations by Reportable Segments and Geographic Area

Based upon our organizational structure, we operate two business segments: (i) publishing of interactive entertainment software and
(ii) distribution of interactive entertainment software and hardware products.

Publishing
refers to the development, marketing and sale of products, either directly, by license or through our affiliate label program with third party publishers. In the United
States, our products are sold primarily on a direct basis to major computer and software retailing organizations, mass market retailers, consumer electronic stores, discount warehouses and mail order
companies. We conduct our international publishing activities through offices in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Australia, Sweden, Canada and Japan. Our products are sold internationally on a
direct to retail basis and through third party distribution and licensing arrangements and through our wholly-owned distribution subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and
Germany.

Distribution
refers to our operations in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany that provide logistical and sales services to third party publishers of interactive entertainment
software, our own publishing operations and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Resources
are allocated to each of these segments using information on their respective net revenues and operating profits before interest and taxes. The segments are not evaluated based
on assets or depreciation.

The
accounting policies of these segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Transactions between segments are eliminated in
consolidation.

earnings (loss) per share because their effect would be antidilutive. Convertible subordinated notes were also not included in the calculations of diluted earnings per share, for the years applicable,
because their effect would be antidilutive.

On
December 4, 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register 7,500,000 shares of our common
stock. On June 4, 2002, we issued the 7,500,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering for proceeds, before issuance costs, of approximately $248.3 million.

In
accordance with Statement of Position ("SOP") 90-7, "Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code," issued by the AICPA, benefits from loss
carryforwards arising prior to our reorganization are recorded as additional paid-in capital. During the year ended March 31, 2001, $3.7 million was recorded as additional
paid-in capital.

As
of March 31, 2002, our available federal net operating loss carryforward of $130.3 million is subject to certain limitations as defined under Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforwards expire between 2006 and 2022. We have various state net operating loss carryforwards which are not subject to limitations under
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have tax credit carryforwards of $11.2 million and $6.1 million for federal and state purposes, respectively, which expire between
2006 and 2022.

At
March 31, 2002, our deferred income tax asset for tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards was reduced by a valuation allowance of $30.5 million as
compared to $9.9 million in the prior fiscal year. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the continued generation of sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of tax
credits and loss carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the net carrying value of the deferred tax asset will be realized.

Cumulative
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided approximated $34.0 million at March 31, 2002. Deferred income taxes
on these earnings have not been provided as these amounts are considered to be permanent in duration.

In
June 1999, we obtained a $100.0 million revolving credit facility and a $25.0 million term loan with a syndicate of banks (the "U.S. Facility"). The revolving
portion of the U.S. Facility provided us with the ability to borrow up to $100.0 million, including issuing letters of credit up to $80 million, on a revolving basis against eligible
accounts receivable and inventory. The term loan had a three year term with principal amortization on a straight-line quarterly basis beginning December 31, 1999, a borrowing rate
based on the banks' base rate (which is generally equivalent to the published prime rate) plus 2% or LIBOR plus 3% and was to expire June 2002. The revolving portion of the U.S Facility had a
borrowing rate based on the banks' base rate plus 1.75% or LIBOR plus 2.75%. In May 2001, we accelerated our repayment of the outstanding balance under the term loan portion of the U.S.
Facility. In connection with the accelerated repayment, we amended the U.S. Facility (the "Amended and Restated U.S. Facility"). The Amended and Restated U.S. Facility eliminated the term loan,
reduced the revolver to $78.0 million and reduced the interest rate to the banks' base rate plus 1.25% or LIBOR plus 2.25%. We pay a commitment fee of


/


% on the unused portion
of the revolver. The Amended and Restated U.S. Facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and was scheduled to expire in June 2002. However, in June 2002, we obtained
an extension of the expiration date to August 2002.

The
original U.S. Facility had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 9.70% for the year ended March 31, 2001. During the year ended March 31, 2002, we did not
borrow against the Amended and Restated U.S. Facility. The Amended and Restated U.S. Facility contains various covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make
other distributions, create certain liens, sell assets, or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions. We are also required to maintain specified financial ratios related to net worth and fixed
charges. As of March 31, 2002 and 2001, we were in compliance with these covenants. As of March 31, 2002, there were no borrowings outstanding and $5.8 million of letters of
credit outstanding against the revolving portion of the Amended and Restated U.S. Facility. As of March 31, 2001, approximately $8.5 million was outstanding under the term
loan portion of the original U.S. Facility. As of March 31, 2001, there were no borrowings outstanding and $18.2 million of letters of credit outstanding against the revolving portion of
the original U.S. Facility.

We
have a revolving credit facility through our CD Contact subsidiary in the Netherlands (the "Netherlands Facility"). The Netherlands Facility permitted revolving credit loans and
letters of credit up to Euro dollars ("EUR") 4.5 million ($3.9 million) and Netherlands Guilders ("NLG") 26 million ($10.4 million) as of March 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances. The Netherlands Facility is due on demand, bears interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus 1.50% and expires
August 2003. As of March 31, 2002, there were no borrowings and no letters of

F-24

credit outstanding under the Netherlands Facility. As of March 31, 2001, there were $1.8 million of borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the Netherlands Facility.

We
also have revolving credit facilities with our CentreSoft subsidiary located in the United Kingdom (the "UK Facility") and our NBG subsidiary located in Germany (the "German
Facility"). The UK Facility provided for British Pounds ("GBP") 7.0 million ($10.0 million) of revolving loans and GBP 1.5 million ($2.1 million) of letters of credit as of
March 31, 2002 and GBP 7.0 million ($10.0 million) of revolving loans and GBP 3.0 million ($4.3 million) of letters of credit as of March 31, 2001. The UK
Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 2%, is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and expires in October 2002. The UK Facility also contains various covenants
that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios related to, among others, fixed charges. As of March 31, 2002 and 2001, we were in compliance with these covenants. No
borrowings were outstanding against the UK Facility at March 31, 2002 or 2001. Letters of credit of GBP 1.5 million ($2.1 million) and GBP 3.0 million ($4.3 million)
were outstanding against the UK Facility at March 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The German Facility provided for revolving loans up to EUR 2.5 million ($2.2 million) and
Deutsche Marks ("DM") 4.0 million ($1.8 million) as of March 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, bears interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus 2.5%, is collateralized by a cash deposit
of approximately GBP 650,000 ($926,000) made by our CentreSoft subsidiary and has no expiration date. No borrowings were outstanding against the German Facility as of March 31, 2002 and 2001.

Mortgage
notes payable relate to the land, office and warehouse facilities of our German and Netherlands subsidiaries. The notes bear interest at 5.45% and 5.35%, respectively, and are
collateralized by the related assets. The Netherlands mortgage note payable is due in quarterly installments of EUR 11,300 ($9,900) and matures January 2019. The German mortgage note payable is
due in bi-annual installments of EUR 74,100 ($64,500) beginning June 2002 and matures December 2019.

Private Placement of Convertible Subordinated Notes

In December 1997, we completed the private placement of $60.0 million principal amount of 6

% convertible subordinated notes due
2005 (the "Notes"). The Notes were convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder at any time after December 22, 1997 (the date of original issuance) and prior to the close of
business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into our common stock at a conversion price of $12.583 per share, post split, subject
to adjustment in certain circumstances. During the year ended March 31, 2002, we called for the redemption of the Notes. In connection with that call, holders converted to common stock
approximately $58.7 million aggregate principal amount of their Notes, net of conversion costs. The remaining Notes were redeemed for cash.

Commitments and Contingencies

Developer and Intellectual Property Contracts

In the normal course of business we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for the development of products, as well as for the rights to
intellectual property ("IP"). Under these agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a developer, or IP holder, based upon contractual arrangements. Assuming all contractual provisions are
met, the total future minimum contract commitment for contracts in place as of March 31, 2002 is approximately $63.7 million, which is scheduled to be paid as follows (amounts in

Legal Proceedings

We are party to routine claims and suits brought against us in the ordinary course of business, including disputes arising over the ownership of intellectual
property rights and collection matters. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such routine claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

Stock Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans

Stock Options

We sponsor five stock option plans for the benefit of officers, employees, consultants and others.

On
February 28, 1992, the shareholders of Activision approved the Activision 1991 Stock Option and Stock Award Plan, as amended, (the "1991 Plan") which permits the granting of
"Awards" in the form of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options ("ISOs"), stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock awards, deferred stock awards and other common
stock-based awards. The

F-26

total number of shares of common stock available for distribution under the 1991 Plan is 11,350,000. The 1991 Plan requires available shares to consist in whole or in part of authorized and unissued
shares or treasury shares. There were no shares remaining available for grant under the 1991 Plan as of March 31, 2002.

On
September 23, 1998, the shareholders of Activision approved the Activision 1998 Incentive Plan, as amended (the "1998 Plan"). The 1998 Plan permits the granting of "Awards" in
the form of non-qualified stock options, ISOs, SARs, restricted stock awards, deferred stock awards and other common stock-based awards to directors, officers, employees, consultants and
others. The total number of shares of common stock available for distribution under the 1998 Plan is 4,500,000. The 1998 Plan requires available shares to consist in whole or in part of authorized and
unissued shares or treasury shares. There were approximately 21,000 shares remaining available for grant under the 1998 Plan as of March 31, 2002.

On
April 26, 1999, the Board of Directors approved the Activision 1999 Incentive Plan, as amended (the "1999 Plan"). The 1999 Plan permits the granting of "Awards" in the form of
non-qualified stock options, ISOs, SARs, restricted stock awards, deferred share awards and other common stock-based awards to directors, officers, employees, consultants and others. The
total number of shares of common stock available for distribution under the 1999 Plan is 7,500,000. The 1999 Plan requires available shares to consist in whole or in part of authorized and unissued
shares or treasury shares. As of March 31, 2002, there were no shares remaining available for grant under the 1999 Plan.

On
August 23, 2001, the shareholders of Activision approved the Activision 2001 Incentive Plan, as amended (the "2001 Plan"). The 2001 Plan permits the granting of "Awards" in the
form of non-qualified stock options, ISOs, SARs, restricted stock awards, deferred stock awards and other common stock-based awards to directors, officers, employees, consultants and
others. The total number of shares of common stock available for distribution under the 2001 Plan is 2,250,000. The 2001 Plan requires available shares to consist in whole or in part of authorized and
unissued shares or treasury shares. There were approximately 694,000 shares remaining available for grant under the 2001 Plan as of March 31, 2002. On April 4, 2002, the Board of
Directors approved a 1.5 million increase in the total number of shares of common stock available for distribution under the 2001 Plan. This increase in the 2001 Plan will be put before our
shareholders for approval in connection with our 2002 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

On,
April 4, 2002, the Board of Directors approved the Activision 2002 Incentive Plan (the "2002 Plan"). The 2002 Plan permits the granting of "Awards" in the form of
non-qualified stock options, ISOs, SARs, restricted stock awards, deferred share awards and other common stock-based awards to officers (other than executive officers), employees,
consultants, advisors and others. The total number
of shares of common stock available for distribution under the 2002 Plan is 2,350,000. The 2002 Plan requires available shares to consist in whole or in part of authorized and unissued shares or
treasury shares.

The
exercise price for Awards issued under the 1991 Plan, 1998 Plan, 1999 Plan, 2001 Plan and 2002 Plan (collectively, the "Plans") is determined at the discretion of the Board of
Directors (or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which administers the Plans), and for ISOs, is not to be less than the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant,
or in the case of non-qualified options, must exceed or be equal to 85% of the fair market value at the date of grant. Options typically become exercisable in installments over a period
not to exceed five years and must be exercised within 10 years of the date of grant. However, certain options granted to executives vest immediately. Historically, stock options have been
granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair market value at the date of grant.

In
connection with prior employment agreements between Activision and Robert A. Kotick, Activision's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian G. Kelly, Activision's
Co-Chairman,

F-27

Mr. Kotick and Mr. Kelly were granted options to purchase common stock. The Board of Directors approved the granting of these options. Relating to such grants, as of March 31,
2002, 4,142,300 and 3,267,300 shares with weighted average exercise prices of $6.31 and $6.90 were outstanding and exercisable, respectively.

We
additionally have approximately 390,000 options outstanding to employees as of March 31, 2002, with a weighted average exercise price of $13.92. The Board of Directors approved
the granting of these options. Such options have terms similar to those options granted under the Plans.

We
also issue stock options in conjunction with acquisition transactions. For the year ended March 31, 2002, 12,000 options with a weighted average exercise price of $6.67 were
outstanding relating to options issued in conjunction with acquisitions completed in fiscal 1999 and 1998. The Board of Directors approved the granting of these options. None of these shares were
exercisable as of March 31, 2002.

Director Warrants

The Director Warrant Plan, which expired on December 19, 1996, provided for the automatic granting of warrants ("Director Warrants") to purchase 25,000
shares of common stock to each director of Activision who was not an officer or employee of Activision or any of its subsidiaries. Director Warrants granted under the Director Warrant Plan vest 25% on
the first anniversary of the date of grant, and 12.5% each six months thereafter. The expiration of the Plan had no effect on the
outstanding Director Warrants. As of March 31, 2002, there were no shares of common stock available for distribution nor were there any warrants outstanding under the Director Warrant Plan.

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997, we issued warrants to purchase 60,000 shares of our common stock, at exercise prices ranging from $7.87 to $9.25 to two of our outside
directors in connection with their election to the Board. Such warrants have vesting terms identical to the Directors Warrants and expire within 10 years. Relating to such warrants, as of
March 31, 2002, 30,000 shares with a weighted average exercise price of $9.02 were outstanding and exercisable.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees (the "Purchase Plan"). Under the Purchase Plan, shares of our common stock may be purchased at
six-month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or last day of each six-month period (the "Offering Period"). Employees may purchase shares having
a value not exceeding 10% of their gross compensation during an Offering Period. Employees purchased approximately 44,900 and 51,900 shares at a price of $13.64 and $6.31 per share during the Purchase
Plan's offering period ended September 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and approximately 48,000 and 65,900 shares at a price of $14.23 and $7.86 per share during the Purchase Plan's offering
period ended March 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Pro Forma Information

Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share is required by SFAS No. 123. This information is required to be determined
as if we had accounted for our employee stock options (including shares issued under the Purchase Plan and Director Warrant Plan and other employee option grants, collectively called "options")
granted during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 under the fair value method. The fair value of options granted in the years ended March 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 reported below has been estimated at
the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because our options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in the opinion of
management, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our options. For options granted during fiscal 2002, the per share weighted average fair value
of options with exercise prices equal to market value on date of grant was $6.86. For options granted during fiscal 2001, the per share weighted average fair value of options with exercise prices
equal to market value on date of grant and exercise prices greater than market value were $2.08, and $0.89, respectively. For options granted during fiscal 2000, the per share weighted average fair
value of options with exercise prices equal to market value on date of grant, exercise prices greater than market value and exercise prices less than market value were $3.94, $1.76 and $5.33,
respectively. The per share weighted average estimated fair value of Employee Stock Purchase Plan shares granted during the year ended March 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $4.41, $2.32 and $2.23,
respectively.

For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. Had we determined compensation cost based on the
fair value of the stock options at their date of grant as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, our net income (loss) and earnings
(loss) per share would have been reported as the pro forma amounts as below (amounts in thousands except for per share information):

The
effects on pro forma disclosures of applying SFAS No. 123 are not likely to be representative of the effects on pro forma disclosures of future years.

Non-Employee Warrants

In prior years, we have granted stock warrants to third parties in connection with the development of software and the acquisition of licensing rights for
intellectual property. The warrants generally vest upon grant and are exercisable over the term of the warrant. The exercise price of third party warrants is generally greater than or equal to the
fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant. No non-employee warrants were granted during the years ended March 31, 2002 or 2001. As of March 31, 2002, 777,000
third party warrants to purchase common stock were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $17.58 per share. As of March 31, 2001, 1,974,000 third party warrants to purchase
common stock were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $7.26 per share.

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000, we granted warrants to a third party to purchase 150,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $7.75 per share in
connection with, and as partial consideration for, a license agreement that allows us to utilize the third party's name in conjunction with certain Activision products. The warrants vested upon grant,
have a seven year term and become exercisable ratably in annual installments over the warrant term. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model, assuming a
risk-free rate of 4.77%, a volatility factor of 66% and expected term as noted above. The weighted average estimated fair value of third party warrants granted during the year ended
March 31, 2000 was $5.26 per share. As of March 31, 2000, 2,370,000 third party warrants to purchase common stock were outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $7.35 per
share.

In
accordance with EITF 96-18, we measure the fair value of the securities on the measurement date. The fair value of each warrant is capitalized and amortized to expense
when the related product is released and the related revenue is recognized. During fiscal year 2002, 2001 and 2000, $1.1 million, $1.4 million and $5.8 million, respectively, was
amortized and included in royalty expense relating to warrants.

Employee Retirement Plan

We have a retirement plan covering substantially all of our eligible employees. The retirement plan is qualified in accordance with Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan, employees may defer up to 15% of their pre-tax salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute 5% of each dollar contributed by a
participant. Our matching contributions to the plan were $82,000, $62,000 and $46,000 during the year ended March 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

14.

Shareholders' Equity

Stock Split

In October 2001, the Board of Directors approved a three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. The
stock split was paid at the close of business on November 20, 2001, to shareholders of record as of November 6, 2001. The consolidated financial statements, including all share and per
share data, have been restated to give effect to the stock split.

Repurchase Plan

As of May 9, 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $15.0 million of our common stock as well as our convertible subordinated
notes. The shares and notes could be purchased from time to time through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During the year

F-31

ended March 31, 2001, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of our common stock for approximately $15.0 million. We financed the purchase of such shares with available cash.

Shareholders' Rights Plan

On April 18, 2000, our Board of Directors approved a shareholders rights plan (the "Rights Plan"). Under the Rights Plan, each common shareholder at the
close of business on April 19, 2000, received a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held. Each right represents the right to purchase one one-hundredth (1/100) of a
share of our Series A Junior Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $40.00. Initially, the rights are represented by our common stock certificates and are neither exercisable nor traded
separately from our common stock. The rights will only become exercisable if a person or group acquires 15% or more of the common stock of Activision, or announces or commences a tender or exchange
offer which would result in the bidder's beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock.

In
the event that any person or group acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock each holder of a right (other than such person or members of such group) will thereafter have
the right to receive upon exercise of such right, in lieu of shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock, the number of shares of common stock of Activision having a value equal to two times the
then current exercise price of the right. If we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person has acquired 15% or more of our common stock, each holder of a right
will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such right a number of the acquiring company's common shares having a market value equal to two times the then current exercise price of the
right. For persons who, as of the close of business on April 18, 2000, beneficially own 15% or more of the common stock of Activision, the Rights Plan "grandfathers" their current level of
ownership, so long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of certain limitations.

We
may redeem the rights for $.01 per right at any time until the first public announcement of the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 15% of our common stock. At any time after a
person has acquired 15% or more (but before any person has acquired more than 50%) of our common stock, we may exchange all or part of the rights for shares of common stock at an exchange ratio of one
share of common stock per right. The rights expire on April 18, 2010.

Subsequent Events—Unaudited

On December 4, 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register
7,500,000 shares of our common stock. On June 4, 2002, we issued the 7,500,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering for proceeds, before issuance costs, of approximately
$248.3 million. The proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, additions to working capital and financing of capital expenditures,
joint ventures and/or strategic acquisitions.

On
May 20, 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding capital of Z-Axis Ltd. ("Z-Axis"), a privately held interactive software development company, in
exchange for $12.5 million in cash and 249,190 shares of our common stock. Additional shares of our common stock also may be issued to Z-Axis' equity holders and employees over the
course of several years, depending on the satisfaction of certain product performance requirements and other criteria. Z-Axis is a console software developer with a focus on action and
action-sports video games.

On
May 10, 2002, we acquired 30% of the outstanding capital stock of Infinity Ward, Inc. ("Infinity Ward"), as well as an option to purchase the remaining 70% of the
outstanding capital stock of Infinity Ward. Infinity Ward is a privately held interactive software development company with a focus on first person action games for personal computers.
