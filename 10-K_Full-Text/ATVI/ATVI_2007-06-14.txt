Item 1.

BUSINESS

(a)

General

Activision,
Inc. (“Activision,” the “Company,” or “we”) is a leading international
publisher of interactive entertainment software and peripheral products. We
have built a company with a diverse portfolio of products that spans a wide
range of categories and target markets and that is used on a variety of game
hardware platforms and operating systems. We have created, licensed, and
acquired a group of highly recognizable brands, which we market to a variety of
consumer demographics. Our fiscal 2007 product portfolio included such
best-selling products as

Call of Duty 3, Guitar
Hero II, Tony Hawk’s Project 8, Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam,  Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Over the Hedge,

and

X-Men:
The Official Game

.

Our products
cover diverse game categories including action/adventure, action sports,
racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person action, music-based gaming, and
strategy. Our target customer base ranges from casual players to game
enthusiasts, children to adults, and mass-market consumers to “value” buyers. We
currently offer our products primarily in versions that operate on the Sony
PlayStation 2 (“PS2”), Sony PlayStation 3 (“PS3”), Nintendo Wii (“Wii), and
Microsoft Xbox 360 (“Xbox360”) console systems, Nintendo Game Boy Advance (“GBA”),
Sony PlayStation Portable (“PSP”), and Nintendo Dual Screen (“NDS”) hand-held
devices, and the personal computer (“PC”). The installed base for the current
generation of hardware platforms is significant and the fiscal 2006 release of
the Xbox360 and the fiscal 2007 releases of the PS3 and the Wii will further
expand the software market. We had a successful and significant presence at the
launches of the PS3 and the Wii with three launch titles for the PS3,

Call of Duty 3, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance,

and

Tony Hawk’s Project 8,

and five launch titles for the Wii,

Call of Duty 3, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, World Series of Poker:
Tournament of Champions, Rapala Tournament Fishing,

and

Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam.

Our plan is to continue to build
on our significant launch presence on the PS3, Wii, and Xbox360 (“the
next-generation platforms”) by continuing to expand the number of titles
released on the next generation platforms while continuing to market to
current-generation platforms as long as economically attractive given their
large installed base.

Our publishing
business involves the development, marketing, and sale of products directly, by
license, or through our affiliate label program with certain third-party
publishers. Our distribution business consists of operations in Europe that
provide logistical and sales services to third-party publishers of interactive
entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of
interactive entertainment hardware.

We were
originally incorporated in California in 1979. In December 1992, we
reincorporated in Delaware. In June 2000, we reorganized into the current
holding company organizational structure.

In April 2003, the Board of Directors approved a three-for-two split of
our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. The
split was paid on June 6, 2003 to shareholders of record as of May 16, 2003. In
February 2004, the Board of Directors approved a three-for-two split of our
outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. The
split was paid on March 15, 2004 to shareholders of record as of February 23,
2004. In February 2005, the Board of Directors approved a four-for-three split
of our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 33-1/3% stock
dividend. The split was paid March 22, 2005 to shareholders


of record as
of March 7, 2005. In September 2005, the Board of Directors approved a
four-for-three split of our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a
33-1/3% stock dividend. The split was paid October 24, 2005 to shareholders of
record as of October 10, 2005. The par value of our common stock was maintained
at the pre-split amount of $.000001. All share and per share data have been restated
as if the stock splits had occurred as of the earliest period presented.

(b)

Business
Combinations

We have
completed a number of acquisitions of both software development companies and
interactive entertainment product distribution companies. In fiscal 2007, we
acquired video game publisher RedOctane Inc., the publisher of the popular
Guitar Hero franchise. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional
information regarding the accounting treatment of these and prior acquisitions.

(c)

Financial
Information About Industry Segments

We have two
reportable segments: publishing and distribution. Publishing relates to the
development (both internally and externally), marketing and sale of DVD, CD,
UMD, online, and cartridge-based interactive entertainment software and
peripheral products owned or controlled by us directly, by license, or through
our affiliate label program with certain third-party publishers. Distribution
primarily refers to logistical and sales services provided by our European
distribution subsidiaries to third-party publishers of interactive
entertainment software, our own publishing operations and manufacturers of
interactive entertainment hardware. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain
financial information regarding reporting segment and geographic areas required
by Item 1.

(d)

Narrative
Description of Business

Our objective
is to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of
quality interactive entertainment software and peripheral products that deliver
a highly satisfying consumer entertainment experience. Our business strategy,
the key components of our business operations, and the risk factors that could
impact our business are detailed below.

Strategy

Create,
Acquire, and Maintain Strong Brands.

We focus
development and publishing activities principally on products that are, or have
the potential to become, franchise properties with sustainable consumer appeal
and brand recognition. It is our experience that these products can then serve
as the basis for sequels, prequels, and related new products that can be
released over an extended period of time. We believe that the publishing and
distribution of products based in large part on franchise properties enhances
predictability of revenues and the probability of high unit volume sales and
operating profits. We have entered into a series of strategic relationships
with the owners of intellectual property pursuant to which we have acquired the
rights to publish products based on franchises such as Marvel Characters, Inc. properties,
including Spider-Man and X-Men. We have
a multi-year, multi-property, publishing agreement with DreamWorks Animation LLC
that grants us the exclusive rights to publish video games based on DreamWorks
Animation SKG’s theatrical release “Shrek 2,” which was released in the first
quarter of fiscal 2005, “Shark Tale,” which was released in the second quarter
of fiscal 2005, “Madagascar,” which was released in the first quarter of fiscal
2006, “Over the Hedge,” which was released in the first quarter of fiscal 2007,
and all of their respective forthcoming sequels, including “Shrek the Third,”
which was released in May 2007, and “Madagascar 2.”  As part of our agreement with DreamWorks
Animation, we have the exclusive video game rights to potential future films in
the “Shrek” franchise beyond “Shrek the Third,” upcoming movies, including “Bee
Movie” and “Kung Fu Panda,” as well as other films currently in development,
including “Creature Feature” and “How to Train Your Dragon.”  We have a strategic alliance with
Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. that grants us the exclusive, worldwide interactive
rights to develop and publish “World Series of Poker” video games based on the
popular World Series of Poker Tournament. We also have a strategic relationship
with professional skateboarder Tony Hawk through an exclusive multi-year
agreement to develop video games using his name and likeness. Through fiscal
2007, we have released eight successful titles in the Tony Hawk franchise. We
also have created a number of successful internally developed intellectual
properties such as the True Crime and Call of Duty franchise properties, and

GUN

. We also have agreements with MGM
Interactive and EON Productions Ltd. to develop and publish video games based
on the James Bond license and with Hasbro Properties Group (“Hasbro”) to
develop and publish video games based on the “Transformers” brand. We plan on
releasing our first title under the Hasbro license,

Transformers
the Game,


concurrently with the DreamWorks Pictures and Paramount Pictures
Corporation motion picture release, “Transformers,” in July 2007.

Execute
Disciplined Product Selection and Development Processes.

The
success of our publishing business depends, in significant part, on our ability
to develop high quality games that will generate high unit volume sales. Our
publishing units have implemented a formal control process for the selection,
development, production, and quality assurance of our products. We apply this
process, which we refer to as the “Greenlight Process,” to all of our products,
whether externally or internally developed. The Greenlight Process includes
in-depth reviews of each project at four important stages of development by a
team that includes many of our highest-ranking operating managers and
coordination between our sales and marketing personnel and development staff at
each step in the process.

We develop our
products using a combination of our internal development resources and external
development resources acting under contract with us. We typically select our
external developers based on their track record and expertise in producing
products in the same category. One developer will often produce the same game
for multiple platforms and will produce sequels to the original game. We
believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us
to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development
resources, which we believe adds to the quality of our products.

Create and
Maintain Diversity in Product Mix, Platforms, and Markets.

We
believe that maintaining a diversified mix of products can reduce our operating
risks and enhance profitability. Therefore, we develop and publish products
spanning a wide range of product categories, including action/adventure, action
sports, racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person action, music-based
gaming, and strategy. We also develop products designed for target audiences
ranging from casual players to game enthusiasts, children to adults, and
mass-market consumers to “value” buyers. Presently, we concentrate on
developing, publishing, and distributing products that operate on PS2,  PS3, Xbox360, and Wii console systems, GBA,
PSP, and NDS hand-held devices, and the PC. We typically offer our products for
use on multiple platforms in order to reduce the risks associated with any
single platform, leverage our costs over a larger installed hardware base, and
increase unit sales.

Continue to
Improve Profitability.

We continually strive to manage
risk and increase our operating leverage and efficiency with the goal of
increased profitability. We believe the key factor affecting our future
profitability will be the success rate of our product releases. Therefore, our
product selection and development process includes, as a significant component,
periodic evaluations of the expected commercial success of products under
development. Through this process, for titles that we determine to be less
promising, corrections are made in the development process or, if necessary,
they are discontinued before we incur additional development costs. In
addition, we believe our focus on cross platform releases and branded products
will contribute to improved profitability.

We continue to
focus on increasing our margins. We have, for example, acquired certain
experienced and specialized developers in instances where we can enhance
profitability through the elimination of royalty obligations. Additionally, we
often rely on independent third-party interactive entertainment software
developers to develop some of our software products, thereby taking advantage
of specialized independent developers without incurring the fixed overhead
obligations associated with increased internally employed staff.

Our sales and
marketing staff work with our studio resources to increase the visibility of
new product launches and to coordinate the timing and promotion of product
releases. Our finance and sales and marketing personnel work together to
improve inventory management and receivables collections. We have instituted
broad, objective-based reward programs that provide incentives to management
and staff throughout the organization to produce results that meet our
financial objectives.

Grow
Through Continued Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances.

The
interactive entertainment industry has been consolidating, and we believe that
success in this industry will be driven in part by the ability to take
advantage of scale. Specifically, smaller companies are more capital
constrained, enjoy less predictability of revenues and cash flow, lack product
diversity and must spread fixed costs over a smaller revenue base. Several
industry leaders are emerging that combine the entrepreneurial and creative
spirit of the industry with professional management, the ability to access the
capital markets, and the ability to maintain favorable relationships with
developers, intellectual property owners, and retailers. Through numerous
completed acquisitions since 1997, we believe that we have successfully
diversified our operations, our channels of distribution, our development
talent pool, and our library of titles, and have emerged as one of the industry’s
leaders. We intend to continue to evaluate the expansion of our resources
through acquisitions, strategic relationships, and key license transactions. We
intend to continue expanding


our intellectual property library through key license transactions and
strategic relationships with intellectual property owners and to continue to
evaluate opportunities to increase our development capacity through the
acquisition of or investment in selected experienced software development
firms.

Products

Historically,
we have been best known for our action/adventure, strategy, and simulation
products. We have been successful in the superheroes and skateboarding
categories with our release of titles based on the Spider-Man and X-Men
properties, as well as the Tony Hawk franchise. We have also been successful in
the first person action categories through the Call of Duty original
intellectual property, which we plan on continuing as a successful long-term
franchise. In fiscal 2007 we successfully entered the music-based gaming genre
with the acquisition of the Guitar Hero franchise. This franchise combines
interactive software with a hardware peripheral in the form of a guitar and
provides us with an early leadership position and long-term growth opportunity.
We have established ourselves as a leader in the “value” software publishing
business with products under our Cabela’s, Rapala, World Series of Poker, and
Greg Hasting’s

Paintball
licenses, as well as with products distributed on behalf of our “value”
affiliate label partners. Products published by us in this category are
generally developed by third parties, often under contract with us, and are
marketed under the Activision Value Publishing name. Value software is
typically less sophisticated and less complex, both in terms of the development
process and consumer gameplay.

Hardware
Licenses.

Our products currently are being developed
or published primarily for PS2, PS3, Wii, and Xbox360 console systems; PSP and
NDS hand-held devices; and PCs. In order to maintain general access to the
console systems and hand-held devices marketplace, we have maintained licenses
for PS2, PS3, Wii, and Xbox360 console systems and GBA, PSP, and NDS hand-held
devices with the owners of each such platform. Each license allows us to create
multiple products for the applicable platform, subject to certain approval
rights which are reserved by each licensor. Each license also requires that we
pay the licensor a per unit royalty for each unit manufactured. In contrast, we
are not required to obtain any license for the development and production of
products for PCs.

Intellectual
Property Rights.

Many of our current and planned
releases are based on intellectual property, other character or story rights, and
music rights licensed from third parties, as well as a combination of
characters, worlds, and concepts derived from our extensive library of titles,
and original characters and concepts owned and created by us. When publishing
products based on licensed intellectual property rights, we generally seek to
capitalize on the name recognition, marketing efforts, and goodwill associated
with the underlying property. For intellectual property owned by Activision, we
generally attempt to establish such properties as sustainable, long-term game
franchises.

In acquiring
intellectual property rights from third parties, we seek to obtain rights to
publish titles across a variety of platforms, to include the ability to produce
multiple titles and to retain rights over an extended period of time. In past
years, we have been able to enter into a series of long-term or multi-product
agreements with owners of various intellectual properties that are well known
throughout the world and to create products based on these recognizable
characters, story lines, or concepts. These agreements typically provide us
with exclusive publishing rights for a specific period of time and, in some
cases, for specified platforms and, in other cases, with renewal rights upon
the satisfaction of certain conditions. The scope of our licensing activities
includes theatrical motion pictures, television shows, animated films and
series, comic books, literary works, music, sports personalities and events,
and celebrities. We intend to continue expanding relationships with our
existing intellectual property partners and to enter into agreements with other
intellectual property owners for additional recognizable properties,
characters, story lines and concepts. However, we may not be able to maintain
or expand our existing relationships or to seek out and sustain new long-term
relationships of similar caliber in the future.

Product
Development and Support

We develop and
produce titles using a model in which a core group of creative, production, and
technical professionals, in coordination with our marketing and finance
departments, have responsibility for the entire development and production process
including the supervision and coordination of internal and external resources. This
team assembles the necessary creative elements to complete a title using, where
appropriate, outside programmers, artists, animators, scriptwriters, musicians
and songwriters, sound effects and special effects experts, and sound and video
studios. We believe that this model allows us to supplement internal expertise
with top quality external resources on an as-needed basis.


In addition,
we often seek out and engage independent third-party developers to create
products on our behalf. Such products are sometimes owned by us, and usually we
have unlimited rights to commercially exploit these products. In other
circumstances, the third-party developer may retain ownership of the
intellectual property and/or technology included in the product and reserve
certain exploitation rights. We typically select these independent third-party
developers based on their expertise in developing products in a specific
category and use the same developer to produce the same game for multiple
platforms. Each of our third-party developers is under contract with us for
specific or multiple titles. From time to time, we also acquire the license rights
to publish and/or distribute software products that are or will be
independently created by third-party developers. In such cases, the agreements
with such developers provide us with exclusive publishing and/or distribution
rights for a specific period of time, often for specified platforms and
territories. In either case, we often have the ability to publish and/or
distribute sequels, conversions, enhancements, and add-ons to the product
initially being produced by the independent developer and frequently have the
right to engage the services of the original developer with regard to the
development of such products.

In
consideration for the services that the independent third-party developer
provides, it receives a royalty generally based on net sales of the product
that it has developed. Typically, the developer also receives an advance, which
we recoup from the royalties otherwise payable to the developer. The advance
generally is paid in “milestone” stages. The payment at each stage is tied to
the completion and delivery of a detailed performance milestone. Some contracts
include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are recorded as an asset when
actually paid and as a liability when incurred, rather than recording the asset
and liability upon execution of the contract. Working with an independent
developer allows us to reduce our fixed development costs, share development
risks with the third-party developer, take advantage of the third-party
developer’s expertise in connection with certain categories of products or
certain platforms, and gain access to proprietary development technologies.

From time to
time, we may make a capital investment and hold a minority interest in a
third-party developer in connection with interactive entertainment software
products to be developed by such developer for us, which we believe helps to
create a closer relationship between us and the developer. We account for those
capital investments over which we have the ability to exercise significant
influence using the equity method. For those investments over which we do not
have the ability to exercise significant influence, we account for our
investment using the cost method. There can be no assurance that we will
realize long-term benefits from such investments or that we will continue to
carry such investments at their current value.

“Greenlight
Process”

We have
adopted and implemented a rigorous procedure for the selection, development,
production, and quality assurance of our internally and externally produced interactive
entertainment software titles. The process, known internally as the “Greenlight
Process,” involves four phases throughout the development and production phases
of a title, each of which includes a number of specific performance milestones.
The four phases of the “Greenlight Process” are the concept, prototype, first
playable, and alpha. This procedure is designed to enable us to manage and
control production and development budgets and timetables, to identify and
address production and technical issues at the earliest opportunity, and to
coordinate marketing and quality control strategies throughout the production
and development phases, all in an environment that fosters creativity. Checks
and balances are intended to be provided through the structured interaction of
the project team with our creative, technical, marketing, and quality
assurance/customer support personnel, as well as our legal, accounting, and
finance departments. In order to maintain the competitiveness of our products
and to take advantage of increasingly sophisticated technology associated with
hardware platforms, our development process includes a significant amount of
time for play-testing new products, and extensive product quality evaluations.

Product
Support

We provide various
forms of product support to both our internally and externally developed titles.
Our quality assurance personnel are involved throughout the development and
production of each title published by us. We subject all such products to
extensive testing before release to ensure compatibility with all appropriate
hardware systems and configurations and to minimize the number of bugs and
other defects found in the products. To support our products after release, we
provide online access to our customers on a 24-hour basis as well as telephone
operator help lines during regular business hours. The customer support group
tracks customer inquiries and we use this data to help improve the development
and production processes.


Publishing
Activities

Marketing

Our marketing
efforts include online activities (such as the creation of World Wide Web pages
to promote specific titles), public relations, print and broadcast advertising,
coordinated in-store and industry promotions (including merchandising and point
of purchase displays), participation in cooperative advertising programs,
direct response vehicles, and product sampling through demonstration software
distributed through the Internet or on compact discs. From time to time, we
also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers and retailers in
connection with their own promotional efforts. In addition, certain of our
products contain software that enables customers to “electronically register”
their purchases with us online.

We believe
that certain of our franchise properties have loyal and devoted audiences who
purchase our sequels as a result of dedication to the property and satisfaction
from previous product purchases. We therefore market these sequels both toward
the established market as well as broader audiences. In addition, in marketing
titles based on licensed properties, we believe that we derive benefits from
the continued exploitation of these licensed properties and the marketing and
promotional activities of the property owners.

Sales
and Distribution

North
America.

Our products are available for sale or rental
in thousands of retail outlets domestically. Our North American customers
include Best Buy, Blockbuster, Circuit City, GameStop, Target, Toys “R” Us, and
Wal-Mart. Our largest customers, Wal-Mart and GameStop, accounted for
approximately 22% and 8%, respectively,
of consolidated net revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. For the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2006, our largest customers, Wal-Mart and GameStop,
accounted for 22% and 10%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues.

In the United
States and Canada, our products are sold primarily on a direct basis to
mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and
game specialty stores. We believe that a direct relationship with retail
accounts results in more effective inventory management, merchandising, and
communications than would be possible through indirect relationships. We have
implemented electronic data interchange linkages with many of our retailers to
facilitate the placing and shipping of orders. We sell our products to a
limited number of distributors.

International.

Our products are sold internationally on a
direct-to-retail basis, through third-party distribution and licensing
arrangements, and through our wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries. We
conduct our international publishing activities through offices in the United
Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden,
Australia, South Korea, and Japan. Whenever practicable, we seek to maximize
our worldwide revenues and profits by releasing high quality foreign language
releases concurrently with English language releases and by continuing to expand
the number of direct selling relationships we maintain with key retailers in
major territories.

Affiliate
Labels.

In addition to our own products, we distribute
a select number of interactive entertainment products that are developed and
marketed by other third-party publishers through our “affiliate label” programs
in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. The distribution of
other publishers’ products allows us to increase the efficiencies of our sales
force and provides us with the ability to better ensure adequate shelf presence
at retail stores for all of the products that we distribute. Distributing other
publishers’ titles mitigates the risk associated with a particular title or
titles published by us failing to achieve expectations. Services provided by us
under our affiliate label program include order solicitation, in-store
marketing, logistics and order fulfillment, sales channel management, as well
as other accounting and general administrative functions. Our current affiliate
label partners include LucasArts, as well as several affiliate label partners
in our “value” business. Each affiliate label relationship is unique and may
pertain only to distribution in certain geographic territories such as the North
America, Europe, or the Asia Pacific region and may be further limited only to
specific titles or titles for specific platforms.

See Note 10 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K for certain financial information regarding reporting segments and
geographic areas required by Item 1.

Distribution

We distribute
interactive entertainment hardware and software products in Europe through our
European distribution subsidiaries: Centresoft in the United Kingdom; NBG in
Germany; and CD Contact in the Benelux


countries. These subsidiaries act as wholesalers in the distribution of
products and also provide packaging and logistical and sales services. They
provide services to our publishing operations and to various third-party
publishers, including Sony Computer Entertainment (“Sony”), Nintendo Co. Ltd. (“Nintendo”),
and Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”). Centresoft is Sony’s exclusive
distributor of PlayStation products to the independent channel in the United
Kingdom. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, sales for Sony, Nintendo, and
Microsoft accounted for approximately 22%, 6%, and 2%, respectively, of our
worldwide distribution net revenues.

We entered
into the distribution business to obtain distribution capacity in Europe for
our own products, while supporting the distribution infrastructure with
third-party sales, and to diversify our operations into the European market. Centresoft
and our other distribution subsidiaries operate in accordance with strict
confidentiality procedures in order to provide independent services to various
third-party publishers.

Emerging
Technologies

We are
actively supporting emerging platforms (wireless devices, digital downloads, closed
and open online networks, and interactive television) by publishing and
licensing key brands for these emerging platforms. We have published and
licensed rights to various brands, such as

Tony Hawk’s Project 8, Tony
Hawk’s Downhill Jam, GUN, Activision Anthology,

and

Call of Duty 3

for various hand-held wireless devices. We
also develop and optimize many of our titles for consoles that support online
play, such as PS2, Xbox Live on the Xbox360, and the Sony PS3 and Nintendo Wii
consoles. We believe that more of our brands can be successfully published for
wireless and online platforms, as well as exploited through other emerging
technologies, as they continue to evolve.

In addition, we
derive revenue from in-game advertising consisting primarily of fixed product
placement. We are developing and expanding on dynamic ad serving technology and
will continue to focus on attracting third parties to advertise in our video
games.

Manufacturing

We prepare a
set of master program copies, documentation, and packaging materials for our
products for each hardware platform on which the product will be released. Except
with respect to products for use on the Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft systems,
our disk duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly,
and shipping are performed by third-party subcontractors.

To maintain
protection over their hardware technologies, Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft
generally specify or control the manufacturing and assembly of finished
products. We deliver the master materials to the licensor or its approved
replicator, which then manufactures finished goods and delivers them to us for
distribution under our label. At the time our product unit orders are filled by
the manufacturer, we become responsible for the costs of manufacturing and the
applicable per unit royalty on such units, even if the units do not ultimately
sell.

To date, we
have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the manufacture and
assembly of our products or material returns due to product defects.

Competition

The
interactive entertainment software industry is intensely competitive and new
interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly
introduced. Our competitors vary in size from small companies with limited resources
to very large corporations with significantly greater financial, marketing, and
product development resources than we have. Due to their greater resources,
certain of our competitors can spend more money and time on developing and
testing products, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more
aggressive pricing policies, pay higher fees to licensors for desirable motion
picture, television, sports and character properties, and pay more to
third-party software developers than we can. In addition, competitors with
larger product lines and popular titles typically have greater leverage with
retailers, distributors, and other customers who may be willing to promote
titles with less consumer appeal in return for access to such competitor’s most
popular titles. We believe that the main competitive factors in the interactive
entertainment software industry include: product features and playability;
brand name recognition; compatibility of products with popular platforms;
access to distribution channels; quality of products; ease of use; price;
marketing support; and quality of customer service.

We compete
primarily with other publishers of personal computer and video game console
interactive entertainment software. Significant third-party software
competitors currently include, among others: Atari, Inc.;


Capcom Co. Ltd.; Eidos PLC; Electronic Arts Inc.; Konami Company Ltd.; Midway
Games Inc.; Namco Bandai Games Ltd.; Sega Enterprises, Ltd.; Take-Two
Interactive Software, Inc.; THQ Inc.; Ubisoft Entertainment; Vivendi Games Publishing;
and the Walt Disney Company. In addition, integrated video game console
hardware and software companies such as Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft compete
directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective
platforms.

Employees

As of March
31, 2007, we had approximately 2,125 employees, including approximately 1,300 in
product development, 200 in North American publishing, 175 in international publishing,
150 in operations, corporate finance and administration, and 300 in European
distribution activities.

As of March
31, 2007, approximately 340 of our full-time employees were subject to term
employment agreements with us. These agreements generally commit such employees
to employment terms of between one and five years from the commencement of
their respective agreements. Most of the employees subject to such agreements
are executive officers or key members of the product development, sales, or marketing
divisions. These individuals perform services for us as executives, directors,
producers, associate producers, computer programmers, game designers, sales
directors, and marketing product managers. The execution by us of employment
agreements with such employees, in our experience, reduces our turnover during
the development, production, and distribution phases of our entertainment
software products and allows us to plan more effectively for future development
and marketing activities.

None of our employees
are subject to a collective bargaining agreement except for the employees of
our German distribution subsidiary who are allowed by German law to belong to
an organized labor council. To date, we have not experienced any labor-related
work stoppages.

Item
1A. RISK FACTORS

Our business
is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future
financial performance. If any of the events or circumstances described below
occurs, our business and financial performance could be harmed, our actual
results could differ materially from our expectations, and the market value of
our securities could decline. The risks discussed below are not the only ones
we face. Additional risks exist that we do not currently believe to be
material, and there may also be other risks that are not currently known to us,
that may also harm our business and adversely affect our future financial
performance and the market value of our stock.

Risks
Factors Relating to the Interactive Entertainment Software Industry and Our
Business

We depend on a relatively small number of
brands for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.

A significant
portion of our revenues is derived from products based on a relatively small
number of popular brands each year, and these products are responsible for a
disproportionate amount of our profits. In addition, many of these products
have substantial production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets. In
fiscal 2007, 39% of our consolidated net revenues (and 52% of our worldwide
publishing net revenues) was derived from three brands, which


accounted for
17%, 13%, and 9% of consolidated net revenues, respectively (and 23%, 18%, and
11% of worldwide publishing net revenues, respectively). In fiscal 2006, 30% of
our consolidated net revenues (and 38% of our worldwide publishing net
revenues) was derived from three brands, which accounted for 14%, 8%, and 8% of
consolidated net revenues, respectively (and 18%, 10%, and 10% of our worldwide
publishing net revenues, respectively ). In fiscal 2005, 37% of our
consolidated net revenues (and 48% of our worldwide publishing net revenues)
was derived from three brands, which accounted for 16%, 11%, and 10% of
consolidated net revenues, respectively (and 21%, 14%, and 13% of our worldwide
publishing net revenues, respectively). We expect that a limited number of
popular brands will continue to produce a disproportionately large amount of
our revenues and profits. Due to this dependence on a limited number of brands,
the failure to achieve anticipated results by one or more products based on
these brands may significantly harm our business and financial results.

Our future success depends on our ability to
release popular products.

The life of
any one game product is relatively short and generally involves a relatively
high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by
a rapid decline in sales. Because revenues associated with an initial product
launch generally constitute a high percentage of the total revenues associated
with the life of a product, delays in product releases or disruptions following
the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material
adverse effect on our operating results and cause our operating results to be
materially different from expectations. It is therefore important for us to be
able to continue to develop many high quality new products that are popularly
received. We focus our development and publishing activities principally on
products that are, or have the potential to become, franchise brand properties.
If we are unable to do this, our business and financial results may be
negatively affected.

Our business is “hit” driven. If we do not
deliver “hit” titles, or if consumers prefer competing products, our sales
could suffer.

While many new
products are regularly introduced, only a relatively small number of “hit”
titles account for a significant portion of net revenue. Competitors may
develop titles that imitate or compete with our “hit” titles, and take sales
away from us or reduce our ability to command premium prices for those titles. Hit
products published by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer
spending than we anticipate, which could cause our product sales to fall below
our expectations. If our competitors develop more successful products or offer
competitive products at lower price, or if we do not continue to develop
consistently high-quality and well received products, our revenue, margins, and
profitability will decline.

If we are unable to maintain or acquire
licenses to intellectual property, we may publish fewer “hit” titles and our
revenue may decline.

Many of our
products are based on intellectual property and other character or story rights
acquired or licensed from third parties. These license and distribution
agreements are limited in scope and time, and we may not be able to renew key
licenses when they expire or to include new products in existing licenses. The
loss of a significant number of our intellectual property licenses or of our
relationships with licensors, or inability to obtain additional licenses of
significant commercial value could have a material adverse effect on our
ability to develop new products and therefore on our business and financial results.
Additionally, the failure of intellectual property acquired by us to be
popularly received could impact the market acceptance of our products in which
the intellectual property is included. Such lack of market acceptance could
result in the write-off of the unrecovered portion of acquired intellectual
property assets, which could cause material harm to our business and financial
results. Furthermore, the competition for these licenses and distribution
agreements is often intense. Competition for these licenses may also drive up
the advances, guarantees, and royalties that we must pay to the licensor, which
could increase our costs.

Our business is highly dependent on the
success, timely release and availability of new video game platforms, on the
continued availability of existing video game platforms, as well as our ability
to develop commercially successful products for these platforms.

We derive most
of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game platforms
manufactured by third parties, such as Sony’s PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3,
Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and Nintendo’s Wii and DS. The success of our business is
driven in large part by the availability of an adequate supply of these video
game platforms, our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be
successful in the marketplace, and our ability to develop commercially
successful products for these platforms. We must make product development
decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated
introduction of a new platform. A new platform for which we


are developing
products may be delayed, may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than
anticipated. Alternatively, a platform for which we have not devoted
significant resources could be more successful than we had initially
anticipated, causing us to miss out on a meaningful revenue opportunity. If the
platforms for which we are developing products are not released when
anticipated, are not available in adequate quantities to meet consumer demand,
or do not attain wide market acceptance, our revenue will suffer, we may be
unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our
products, and our financial performance will be harmed.

Transitions in console platforms could have a
material impact on the market for interactive entertainment software.

In fiscal
2006, Microsoft released Xbox and in fiscal 2007, Sony and Nintendo introduced
their respective next-generation hardware platforms, the PlayStation 3 and Wii.
When new console platforms are announced or introduced into the market,
consumers typically reduce their purchases of game console entertainment
software products for current console platforms in anticipation of new platforms
becoming available. During these periods, sales of our game console
entertainment software products may be expected to slow or even decline until
new platforms are introduced and achieve wide consumer acceptance. This decline
may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new console platforms.
As console hardware moves through its life cycle, hardware manufacturers
typically enact price reductions and decreasing prices may put downward
pressure on our software prices. During platform transitions, we may
simultaneously incur costs both in continuing to develop and market new titles
for prior-generation video game platforms, which may not sell at premium
prices, and also in developing products for next-generation platforms, which
will not generate immediate or near-term revenue. As a result, our operating
results during platform transitions may be more volatile and more difficult to
predict than during other times, which may cause greater fluctuations in our
stock price.

We must make significant expenditures to
develop products for new platforms which may not be successful or released when
anticipated.

We must make
substantial product development and other investments in a particular platform
well in advance of introduction of the platform and we may be required to
realign our product portfolio and development efforts in response to market
changes. Furthermore, development costs for new console platforms are greater
than such costs for current console platforms. If increased costs are not
offset by higher revenues and other cost efficiencies, our operating results
will suffer and our financial position will be harmed. If the platforms for
which we develop new software products or modify existing products are not
released on a timely basis or do not attain significant market penetration, or
if we develop products for a delayed or unsuccessful platform or cancel
development of products in response to market changes, we may not be able to
recover in revenues our development costs, which could be significant, and our
business and financial results could be significantly harmed.

In addition,
we seek to release many of our products in conjunction with specific events,
such as the release of a related movie. If we miss these key selling periods
due to product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we
have developed products, our sales will suffer disproportionately.

If the average price of prior-generation
titles continues to decline or if we are unable to sustain launch pricing on next-generation
titles, our operating results will suffer.

We have
experienced a decrease in the average price of our titles for prior-generation
platforms. As the interactive entertainment industry transitions to
next-generation video game platforms, we expect there to be fewer
prior-generation titles able to command premium prices, and we expect that even
these titles will be subject to price reductions at an earlier point in their
sales cycle than we have seen in prior years. We expect the average price of
prior-generation titles to continue to decline, which may have a negative
effect on our margins and operating results.

Our
next-generation titles for the Xbox360, Sony’s PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo
Wii have been offered at premium retail prices since the launch of such
consoles. We expect to continue to price next-generation titles at a premium level,
but if we are unable to sustain launch pricing on these next-generation titles
we may experience a negative effect on our margins and operating results.


Our industry is highly competitive and our
competition may succeed in narrowing our market share and reducing our sales.

We compete
primarily with other publishers of personal computer and video game console
interactive entertainment software and peripherals. Our competitors vary in
size from small companies with limited resources to very large corporations
with significantly greater financial, marketing, and product development
resources than we have. In addition, integrated video game console hardware and
software companies such as Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft compete directly with
us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms. Certain
of these competitors can spend more money and time on developing and testing
products, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive
pricing policies, pay higher fees to licensors for desirable motion picture,
television, sports, music and character properties, and pay more to third-party
software developers than we can.

We also
compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities. For example,
we believe that the overall growth in the use of the Internet and online
services by consumers may pose a competitive threat if customers and potential
customers spend less of their available time using interactive entertainment
software and more using the Internet and online services. A number of software
publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are
currently developing online games for use by consumers over the Internet.
Future increased consumer acceptance and increases in the availability of
online games or technological advances in online game software or the Internet
could result in a decline in platform-based software and negatively impact
sales of our products. Direct sales of software over the Internet by
competitors could materially adversely affect our distribution business.

Competition in
our industry is intense and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge.

Our platform licensors are our chief
competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of and have broad approval
rights over our video game products.

Generally,
when we develop interactive entertainment software products for hardware
platforms offered by Sony, Nintendo, or Microsoft, the products are
manufactured exclusively by that hardware manufacturer or their approved
replicator.

Our agreements
with these manufacturers include certain provisions, such as approval rights
over all software products and related hardware peripherals and promotional
materials and the ability to change the fee they charge for the manufacturing
of products, which allow them substantial influence over our costs and the
release schedule of our products. In addition, since each of the manufacturers
is also a publisher of games for its own hardware platforms and manufactures
products for all of its other licensees, a manufacturer may give priority to
its own products or those of our competitors in the event of insufficient
manufacturing capacity. Accordingly, Sony, Nintendo, or Microsoft could cause
unanticipated delays in the release of our products as well as increases to our
development, manufacturing, marketing, or distribution costs, which could
materially harm our business and financial results.

In addition,
our platform licensors control our ability to provide online game capabilities
for our console platform products and in large part establish the financial
terms on which these services are offered to consumers. Currently, Microsoft
provides online capabilities for the Xbox360 and Sony provides online
capabilities for PS2 and PS3 products. In each case, compatibility code and/or
the consent of the licensor are required for us to include online capabilities
in our products. As these capabilities become more significant, the failure or
refusal of our licensors to approve our products may harm our business.

Our platform licensors set the royalty rates
and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their platforms, and
therefore have significant influence on our costs.

We pay a
licensing fee to the hardware manufacturer for each copy of a product
manufactured for that manufacturer’s game platform. In order to publish
products for new hardware platforms, we must take a license from the platform
licensor which gives the platform licensor the opportunity to set the fee
structure that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform. Similarly,
the platform licensors have retained the flexibility to change their fee
structures for online gameplay and features for their consoles and the
manufacturing of products. The control that platform licensors have over the
fee structures for their platforms and online access makes it difficult for us
to predict our costs and profitability in the medium to long term. It is also
possible that platform licensors will not renew our licenses. Because
publishing products for console systems is the largest portion of our business,
any increase in fee structures or nonrenewal of licenses would have a
significant negative impact on our business model and profitability.


We rely on independent third parties to
develop some of our software products.

We rely on
independent third-party interactive entertainment software developers to
develop some of our software products. Since we depend on these developers, in
the aggregate, we remain subject to the following risks:

•

Continuing
strong demand for developers’ resources, combined with the recognition they
receive in connection with their work, may cause developers who worked for us
in the past either to work for our competitors in the future or to renegotiate
our agreements with them on terms less favorable for us;

•

Limited
financial resources and business expertise and inability to retain skilled
personnel may force developers out of business prior to completing our products
or require us to fund additional costs; and

•

Our competitors
may acquire the businesses of key developers or sign them to exclusive
development arrangements. In either case, we would not be able to continue to
engage such developers’ services for our products, except for those that they
are contractually obligated to complete for us.

Increased
competition for skilled third-party software developers also has compelled us
to agree to make significant advance payments on royalties to game developers. If
the products subject to these arrangements do not generate sufficient revenues
to recover these royalty advances, we would have to write-off unrecovered
portions of these payments, which could cause material harm to our business and
financial results. Typically, we pay developers a royalty based on a percentage
of net revenues, less agreed upon deductions, but from time to time, we have
agreed to pay developers fixed per unit product royalties after royalty
advances are fully recouped. To the extent that sales prices of products on
which we have agreed to pay a fixed per unit royalty are marked down, our
profitability could be adversely affected.

If our products contain defects, our business
could be harmed significantly.

Software
products and peripherals as complex as the ones we publish may contain
undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions are released. Despite
extensive testing prior to release, we cannot be certain that errors will not
be found in new products or releases after shipment, that could result in loss
of or delay in market acceptance. This loss or delay could significantly harm
our business, financial results, and reputation.

We may permit our customers to return our
products and to receive pricing concessions which could reduce our net revenues
and results of operations.

We are exposed
to the risk of product returns and price protection with respect to our
distributors and retailers. Return policies allow distributors and retailers to
return defective, shelf-worn, and damaged products in accordance with terms
granted. Price protection, when granted and applicable, allows customers a
credit against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them. We
may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers
under certain conditions. The conditions our customers must meet to be granted
the right to return products or price protection are, among other things,
compliance with applicable payment terms, delivery to us of weekly inventory
and sell-through reports, and consistent participation in the launches of our
premium title releases. We may also consider other factors, including the
facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market factors. When we offer
price protection, we offer it with respect to a particular product to all of
our retail customers; however, only those customers who meet the conditions
detailed above can avail themselves of such price protection. We also offer a
90-day limited warranty to our end users that our products will be free from
manufacturing defects. Although we maintain a reserve for returns and price
protection, and although we may place limits on product returns and price
protection, we could be forced to accept substantial product returns and
provide substantial price protection to maintain our relationships with
retailers and our access to distribution channels. Product returns and price
protection that exceed our reserves could significantly harm our business and
financial results.

Sales of certain titles such as Guitar Hero

TM

are affected by hardware peripheral availability.

Some of our
titles involve a separate hardware peripheral, such as the guitar in Guitar
Hero

TM

. Typically, we sell such
software both in bundles with the hardware peripheral and on a stand-alone
basis. Consumer may not want to buy such game software if they cannot also buy
the hardware peripheral. If we underestimate demand or otherwise are unable to
produce sufficient quantities of the hardware peripheral or allocate too few
peripherals to geographic markets and hardware platforms where demand exceeds
supply, we will forego revenue. This may also create greater opportunities for
competitors to develop or gain market share with competitive product offerings.
If we overestimate demand and make too many peripherals, or allocate too many
peripherals to geographic markets and


hardware
platforms where there is insufficient demand, we will incur unrecoverable
manufacturing costs for unsold units as well as for unsold game software. In
either case, hardware peripheral manufacturing and allocation decisions may
negatively affect our financial performance.

There are a
limited number of manufacturers who are authorized by Sony, Nintendo or
Microsoft to make the hardware peripherals for Guitar Hero

TM

,

and the majority of those manufacturers are
located in China. Anything that adversely impacts the ability of those
manufacturers to produce the hardware peripheral for us, including without
limitation the revocation of the first party license to produce the hardware,
the utilization of such manufacturer’s capacity by one or our competitors, or
issues generally negatively impacting international companies operating in
China, will adversely impact our ability to supply those peripherals to the
market.

We may face difficulty obtaining access to
retail shelf space necessary to market and sell our products effectively.

Retailers of
our products typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional
resources, and there is intense competition among consumer interactive
entertainment software products for high quality retail shelf space and
promotional support from retailers. To the extent that the number of products
and platforms increases, competition for shelf space may intensify and may
require us to increase our marketing expenditures. Retailers with limited shelf
space typically devote the most and highest quality shelf space to those
products expected to be best sellers. We cannot be certain that our new
products will consistently achieve such “best seller” status. Due to increased
competition for limited shelf space, retailers and distributors are in an
increasingly better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale, including
price discounts, price protection, marketing and display fees, and product
return policies. Our products constitute a relatively small percentage of any
retailer’s sales volume. We cannot be certain that retailers will continue to
purchase our products or to provide our products with adequate levels of shelf
space and promotional support on acceptable terms. A prolonged failure in this
regard may significantly harm our business and financial results.

Our sales may decline substantially without
warning and in a brief period of time because a majority of our sales are made
to a relatively small number of key customers and because we do not have
long-term contracts for the sale of our products.

In the United
States and Canada, we primarily sell our products on a direct basis to
mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and
game specialty stores. Our products are sold internationally on a
direct-to-retail basis, through third-party distribution and licensing
arrangements and through our wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries. Our
sales are made primarily on a purchase order basis without long-term agreements
or other forms of commitments. Our largest customers, Wal-Mart and GameStop,
accounted for approximately 22% and 8%, respectively, of our consolidated net
revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 and approximately 22% and 10%
of our consolidated net revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. The
loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any of our principal retail
customers or distributors could significantly harm our business and financial
results. The concentration of sales in a small number of large customers also
could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large
customers became unable to pay for our products. In addition, having such a
large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers reduces
our negotiating leverage with these customers.

We may be burdened with payment defaults and
uncollectible accounts if our distributors or retailers cannot honor their
credit arrangement with us.

Distributors
and retailers in the interactive entertainment software industry have from time
to time experienced significant fluctuations in their businesses and a number
of them have failed. The insolvency or business failure of any significant
retailer or distributor of our products could materially harm our business and
financial results. We typically make sales to most of our retailers and some
distributors on unsecured credit, with terms that vary depending upon the
customer’s credit history, solvency, credit limits, and sales history, as well
as whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance. Although, as in the case
with most of our customers, we have insolvency risk insurance to protect
against our customers’ bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation, this insurance
contains a significant deductible and a co-payment obligation, and the policy
does not cover all instances of non-payment. In addition, although we maintain
a reserve for uncollectible receivables, the reserve may not be sufficient in
every circumstance. As a result, a payment default by a significant customer
could significantly harm our business and financial results.


We may not be able to maintain our
distribution relationships with key vendors and customers.

Our CD
Contact, NBG, and Centresoft subsidiaries distribute interactive entertainment
software and hardware products and provide related services in the Benelux
countries, Germany, and the United Kingdom, respectively, and via export in
other European countries for a variety of entertainment software publishers,
many of which are our competitors, and hardware manufacturers. From time to
time, they also maintain exclusive relationships to serve certain retail
customers. These services are generally performed subject to limited-term arrangements.
Although we expect to use reasonable efforts to retain these vendors and retail
customer relationships, we may not be successful in this regard. The
cancellation or non-renewal of one or more of these arrangements could
significantly harm our business and financial results.

Our business is subject to risks generally
associated with the entertainment industry, any of which could significantly
harm our operating results.

Our business
is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment
industry, including: the popularity, price and timing of our games and the
platforms on which they are played; economic conditions that adversely affect
discretionary consumer spending; changes in consumer demographics; the
availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment; and critical
reviews and public tastes and preferences, which may change rapidly and cannot
necessarily be predicted. Many of these risks are beyond our control. These
risks could negatively impact our business and financial results.

We are exposed to seasonality in the sale of
our products.

The
interactive entertainment software industry is highly seasonal, with the
highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the calendar year end
holiday buying season. As a result, our net revenues, gross profits, and
operating income have historically been highest during the second half of the
calendar year. Our receivables and credit risk are likewise higher during the
second half of the calendar year as our customers stock up on our products for
the holiday season. Additionally, in a platform transition period, sales of
game console software products can be significantly affected by the timeliness
of introduction of game console platforms by the manufacturers of those
platforms, such as Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft. The timing of hardware
platform introduction is also often tied to holidays and is not within our
control. If a hardware platform is released unexpectedly close to the holidays,
this would result in a shortened holiday buying season and could negatively
impact the sales of our products. Further, delays in development, licensor
approvals, or manufacturing can also affect the timing of the release of our
products, causing us to miss key selling periods such as the calendar year end
holiday buying season.

We may not be able to adequately adjust our
cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand.

A significant
portion of our selling and general and administrative expense is comprised of
personnel and facilities. In the event of a significant decline in revenues, we
may not be able to exit facilities, reduce personnel, or make other changes to
our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant
termination and exit costs. Management may not be able to implement such
actions in a timely manner, if at all, to offset an immediate shortfall in
revenues and profit.

If we do not continue to attract and retain
key personnel, we will be unable to effectively conduct our business.

Our success
depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify, hire, and retain
skilled personnel. The software industry is characterized by a high level of
employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors for personnel
with technical, marketing, sales, product development, and management skills. We
may not be able to attract and retain skilled personnel or may incur
significant costs in order to do so. If we are unable to attract additional
qualified employees or retain the services of key personnel, our business and
financial results could be negatively impacted.

Our products are subject to the threat of
piracy and unauthorized copying, and inadequate intellectual property laws and
other protections could prevent us from enforcing or defending our proprietary
technology.

We regard our
software as proprietary and rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark
and trade secret laws, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and
other methods to protect our proprietary rights. We own or license various
copyrights, patents, and trademarks. We are aware that some unauthorized
copying occurs within the interactive entertainment software industry, and if a
significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our software products
were to occur, it could cause material harm to our business and financial
results.


Policing
unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and software piracy is a
persistent problem, especially in some countries. Further, the laws of some
countries where our products are or may be distributed either do not protect
our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of
the United States, or are poorly enforced. Legal protection of our rights may
be ineffective in such countries. In addition, though we take steps to make the
unauthorized copying and distribution of our products more difficult, as do the
manufacturers of consoles on which our games are played, neither our efforts
nor those of the console manufacturers may be successful in controlling the
piracy of our products. Organized pirate operations have been expanding
globally. In addition, the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent
the protection measures we use in our products, the availability of broadband
access to the Internet, the ability to download pirated copies of our games
from various Internet sites and peer-to-peer networks, and the widespread
proliferation of Internet cafes using pirated copies of our products, all have
contributed to an expansion in piracy. This could have a negative effect on our
growth and profitability in the future.

Moreover, as
we leverage our software products using emerging technologies such as the
Internet and online services, our ability to protect our intellectual property
rights and to avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others may
diminish. We cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will
provide adequate protection for our products in connection with these emerging
technologies.

Data breaches involving the source code for
our products or customer or employee data stored by us could adversely affect
our reputation and revenue.

We store the source code for
our interactive entertainment software products as it is created on multiple
electronic devices. In addition, we store customer account information for, and
other confidential information related to, our employees. A breach of the systems
on which such source code, account information and other sensitive data is
stored could lead to piracy of our software or fraudulent activity and claims
and lawsuits against us in connection with data security breaches. If we are
subject to data security breaches, we may have a loss in sales or be forced to
pay damages or other amounts, which could materially and adversely affect our
profitability. In addition, any damage to our reputation resulting from a data
breach could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and future growth
prospects, or increase our costs by leading to additional security measures
being required.

We may be subject to intellectual property
claims.

As the number
of interactive entertainment software products increases and the features and
content of these products continue to overlap, software developers increasingly
may become subject to infringement claims. Many of our products are highly
realistic and feature materials that are based on real world examples, which
may be the subject of intellectual property infringement claims of others. In
addition, our products often utilize complex, cutting edge technology that may
become subject to emerging intellectual property rights of others. Although we
believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not
violate the intellectual property rights of others, it is possible that third
parties still may claim infringement. From time to time, we receive
communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or future
infringement claims against us, whether valid or not, may be time consuming and
expensive to defend.

•

Intellectual
property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the
following:

•

Cease
selling, incorporating, or using products or services that incorporate the
challenged intellectual property;

•

Obtain
a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which if
available at all, may not be available on commercially favorable terms; or

•

Redesign
the affected interactive entertainment software products or hardware peripherals,
which could cause us to incur additional costs, delay introduction and possibly
reduce commercial appeal of our products.

Any of these
actions may cause material harm to our business and financial results.

We are subject to the rating of our content
by the Entertainment Software Rating Board and similar agencies. Failure to
obtain our target ratings for our products could negatively impact our sales.

The
Entertainment Software Rating Board (the “ESRB”) requires game publishers to
provide consumers with ratings information, including information relating to
violence, nudity, or sexual content contained in software titles,


and imposes
significant penalties for noncompliance. Certain countries have also
established similar rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in those
countries. In some instances, we may be required to modify our products to
comply with the requirements of rating systems, which could delay or disrupt
the release of our products, or we may be prevented from selling them
altogether in certain territories. Our software titles receive a rating from
the ESRB of “Everyone” (age 6 and older), “Everyone 10+” (age 10 and older), “Teen”
(age 13 and over), or “Mature” (age 17 and over). Many of our titles have
received an “Mature” rating. None of our titles have received the “Adults Only”
rating (18 and over). We believe that we comply with rating systems and properly
display the ratings and content descriptions received for our titles. If we are
unable to obtain the ratings we have targeted for our products as a result of
changes in the ESRB’s ratings standards or for other reasons, including the
adoption of legislation in this area, our business and prospects could be
negatively affected.

Our business, products, and distribution are
subject to increasing regulation of content in key territories. If we do not
successfully respond to these regulations, our business may suffer.

Legislation is
continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products
and their distribution. For example, privacy laws in the United States and
Europe impose various restrictions on our collection and storage of personal information.
Those rules vary by territory although the Internet recognizes no geographical
boundaries. In addition, many foreign countries have laws that permit
governmental entities to censor the content and/or advertising of interactive
entertainment software. Other countries, such as Germany, prohibit certain
types of content.

In the United
States, numerous laws have been introduced at the federal and state level which
attempt to restrict the content of products such as ours or the distribution of
such products. For example, recent legislation has been adopted in several
states, and proposed at the federal level, that prohibits the sale of certain
games (

e.g.,

violent games or those with “M
(Mature)” or “AO (Adults Only)” ratings) to minors. In addition, a number of
state legislative bodies in states such as Illinois, California, Michigan, and
Washington have introduced various forms of legislation designed to regulate
and control sales of video games deemed inappropriate for sales to minors. New
and recent incidents may lead to increased pressure for legislative activity. To
date, all the courts have ruled on such legislation in a manner favorable to
the interactive entertainment software industry. But in the event such
legislation is adopted and enforced, the sales of our products may be harmed
because the products we are able to offer to our customers and the size of the
potential market for our products may be limited. We may also be required to
modify our products or alter our marketing strategies to comply with new and
possibly inconsistent regulations, which could be costly or delay the release
of our products.

If one or more of our titles were found to
contain objectionable undisclosed, pertinent content, our business could
suffer.

Throughout the
history of our industry, many video games have been designed to include certain
hidden content and gameplay features that are accessible through the use of
in-game cheat codes or other technological means that are intended to enhance
the gameplay experience. However, in some cases, undisclosed, pertinent content
or features have been found in other publishers’ interactive entertainment
software products. In a few cases, the ESRB has reacted to discoveries of
undisclosed, pertinent content and features by changing the rating that was
originally assigned to the product, requiring the publisher to change the game
and/or game packaging and/or fining the publisher. Retailers have on occasion
reacted to the discovery of such undisclosed content by removing these games
from their shelves, refusing to sell them, and demanding that their publishers
accept them as product returns. Likewise, interactive entertainment software
consumers have reacted to the revelation of undisclosed content by refusing to
purchase such games, demanding refunds for games they have already purchased,
refraining from buying other games published by the company whose game
contained the objectionable material, and, in at least one occasion, filing a
lawsuit against the publisher of the product containing such content.

We have
implemented preventative measures designed to reduce the possibility of
objectionable undisclosed, pertinent content from appearing in the video games
we publish. Nonetheless, these preventative measures are subject to human
error, circumvention, overriding, and reasonable resource constraints. If a
video game we published were found to contain undisclosed, pertinent content,
the ESRB could demand that we recall a game and change its packaging to reflect
a revised rating, retailers could refuse to sell it and demand we accept the
return of any unsold copies or returns from customers, and/or consumers could
refuse to buy it, demand that we refund their money or file a lawsuit against
us. This could have a material negative impact on our operating results and
financial condition. In addition, our reputation could be harmed, which could
impact sales of other video games we sell. If any of these consequences were to
occur, our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed.


Our products may be subject to legal claims.

In prior
fiscal years, at least two lawsuits have been filed against numerous video game
companies, including us, by the families of victims who were shot and killed by
teenage gunmen in attacks perpetrated at schools. These lawsuits alleged that
the video game companies manufactured and/or supplied these teenagers with
violent video games, teaching them how to use a gun and causing them to act out
in a violent manner. These lawsuits have been dismissed. Similar additional
lawsuits may be filed in the future. Although our general liability insurance
carrier agreed to defend us in such lawsuits in the past, it is uncertain
whether the insurance carrier would do so in the future, or if it would cover
all or any amounts which we might be liable for if such future lawsuits are not
decided in our favor. If such future lawsuits are filed and ultimately decided
against us and our insurance carrier does not cover the amounts we are liable
for, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
results. Payment of significant claims by insurance carriers may make such
insurance coverage materially more expensive or unavailable in the future,
thereby exposing our business to additional risk.

Other Risks Relating to Our Business and Ownership of Our Stock

We seek to manage our business with a view to
achieving long-term results, and this could have a negative effect on
short-term trading.

We focus on
creation of shareholder value over time, and we intend to make decisions that
will be consistent with this long-term view. As a result, some of our
decisions, such as whether to make or discontinue operating investments, manage
our balance sheet and capital structure, or pursue or discontinue strategic
initiatives, may be in conflict with the objectives of short-term traders. Further,
this could adversely affect our quarterly or other short-term results of
operations.

We may face limitations on our ability to
find suitable acquisition opportunities or to integrate additional acquired
businesses.

We intend to
pursue additional acquisitions of companies, properties, and other assets that
can be purchased or licensed on acceptable terms and which we believe can be
operated or exploited profitably. Some of these transactions could be material
in size and scope. Although we continue to search for additional acquisition
opportunities, we may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisitions. As
the interactive entertainment software industry continues to consolidate, we
face significant competition in seeking and consummating acquisition
opportunities. We may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or an
acquisition may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase
our earnings. In the future, we may issue additional shares of our common stock
in connection with one or more acquisitions, which may dilute our existing
shareholders. Future acquisitions could also divert substantial management time
and result in short-term reductions in earnings or special transaction or other
charges. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully
integrate the businesses that we may acquire into our existing business. Our
shareholders may not have the opportunity to review, vote on, or evaluate
future acquisitions.

From time to
time, we may make a capital investment and hold a minority interest in a
third-party developer in connection with interactive entertainment software
products to be developed by such developer for us, which we believe helps to
create a closer relationship between us and the developer. We account for those
capital investments over which we have the ability to exercise significant
influence using the equity method. For those investments over which we do not
have the ability to exercise significant influence, we account for our
investment using the cost method. There can be no assurance that we will
realize long-term benefits from such investments or that we will continue to
carry such investments at their current value.

Our shareholder rights plan, charter
documents, and other agreements may make it more difficult to acquire us
without the approval of our Board of Directors.

We have
adopted a shareholder rights plan under which one right entitling the holder to
purchase one six-hundredths (1/600) of a share, as adjusted on account of stock
dividends made since the plan’s adoption, of our Series A Junior Preferred
Stock price at an exercise price of $6.67 per share, subject to adjustment and
as adjusted on account of stock dividends made since the plan’s adoption, is
attached to each outstanding share of common stock. Such shareholder rights
plan makes an acquisition of control in a transaction not approved by our Board
of Directors more difficult. Our Amended and Restated By-laws have advance
notice provisions for nominations for election of nominees to the Board of
Directors which may make it more difficult to acquire control of us. Our
long-term


incentive
plans provide, in the discretion of a committee, for acceleration of stock
options following a change in control under certain circumstances, which has
the effect of making an acquisition of control more expensive. In addition,
some of our officers have severance compensation agreements that provide for
substantial cash payments and accelerations of other benefits in the event of a
change in control. These agreements and arrangements may also inhibit a change
in control.

Limitations on our capacity or ability to
issue stock and options may require us to use more cash in our employee
compensation packages.

Our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation and our option plans limit the number
of shares of our stock and the number of stock options that we can issue. To
increase these limits, we must seek and obtain approval of our stockholders. If
our stockholders do not approve increases in our available stock and option “pool”,
our ability to offer stock and stock options to new and existing employees will
be limited. This may in turn impair our ability to recruit and retain employees.
It may also require us to place greater reliance on cash compensation, which
may not be as attractive to existing and prospective employees. Increased use
of cash for employee compensation will also reduce the amount of cash available
to us for other uses. Each of these consequences could have negative effects on
our business and financial results.

Our stock price is highly volatile.

The trading
price of our common stock has been and could continue to be subject to wide
fluctuations in response to many factors, including:

•

Quarter to
quarter variations in results of operations;

•

Our
announcements of new products;

•

Our competitors’
announcements of new products;

•

Our product
development or release schedule;

•

General
conditions in the computer, software, entertainment, media or electronics
industries, and in the economy;

•

Timing of the
introduction of new platforms and delays in the actual release of new
platforms;

•

Hardware
manufacturers’ announcements of price reductions in hardware platforms;

•

Consumer
spending trends;

•

Changes in
earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts; and

•

Investor
perceptions and expectations regarding our products, plans and strategic
position, and those of our competitors and customers.

In addition,
the public stock markets experience extreme price and trading volume
volatility, particularly in high technology sectors of the market. This
volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many
technology companies for reasons often unrelated to the operating performance
of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect
the market price of our common stock.

In our fiscal year 2007, we began recognizing
stock-based compensation expense in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” related to our employee
equity compensation and employee stock purchase programs. The recognition of
this expense has a significant impact in lowering our reported net income (or
increase our reported net loss).

Beginning in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, we adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”
(“SFAS 123R”), which requires us to recognize compensation expense for all
stock-based awards based on estimated fair values. As a result, beginning with
our first quarter


of fiscal 2007, our operating results contain a charge for stock-based
compensation related to the equity-based awards we provide to our employees, as
well as stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plans. This expense
is in addition to the stock-based compensation expense we have recognized in
prior periods related to restricted stock unit grants, acquisitions and other
grants. The stock-based compensation charges we incur depend on the number of
equity-based awards we grant and the number of shares of common stock we sell
under our employee stock purchase plans, as well as a number of estimates and
variables such as estimated forfeiture rates, the trading price and volatility
of our common stock, the expected term of our options, and interest rates. As a
result, our stock-based compensation charges can vary significantly from period
to period. Going forward, our adoption of SFAS 123R will continue to
significantly lower our reported net income (or increase our reported net
loss), which could have an adverse impact on the trading price of our common
stock.

Changes in our tax rates or exposure to
additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our operating results and
financial condition.

We are subject
to income taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Significant
judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes
and, in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and
calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are also
required to estimate what our taxes will be in the future. Although we believe
our tax estimates are reasonable, the estimate process is inherently uncertain,
and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities. Our effective tax rate could
be adversely affected by changes in our business, including the mix of earnings
in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the elections we
make, changes in applicable tax laws as well as other factors. Further, our tax
determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and
developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision. Should
our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates, our income tax provision and
net income could be materially affected.

We are also
required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use,
value-added, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes, in both the
United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under
examination by tax authorities with respect to these non-income taxes. There
can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations, changes in our
business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on
our operating results and financial condition.

Our international revenues may be affected by
regulatory requirements and barriers, cultural differences and currency
fluctuations.

Our
international revenues have accounted for a significant portion of our total
revenues. International sales and licensing accounted for 50%, 52% and 50%,
respectively, of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. We expect that international revenues will continue to account
for a significant portion of our total revenues in the future. International
sales may be subject to unexpected regulatory requirements, tariffs, and other
barriers. Additionally, foreign sales that are made in local currencies may
fluctuate. We have and may continue to engage in limited currency hedging
activities. While these hedging activities mitigate some foreign currency risk,
our reported results of operations and financial condition would be adversely
affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the Euro,
British pound sterling, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. Currency
exchange rate fluctuations had a positive impact on revenues from internal
sales and licensing in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. In the future,
currency exchange rates may have a negative or materially adverse impact on
revenues from international sales and licensing and thus on our business and
financial results. In addition, cultural differences may affect consumer
preferences and limit the popularity of titles that are “hits” in the United
States. If we do not correctly assess consumer preferences in the countries in
our market, our sales and revenue may be lower than expected.

Risk
Factors Relating to Results of the Special Subcommittee Review of our Stock
Option Granting Practices

SEC investigation and litigation relating to
stock options remain pending and may adversely affect our business and results
of operations.

Although the special subcommittee of
independent members of our Board of Directors established in July 2006 to
review our historical stock option granting practices (the “Special
Subcommittee”) has completed its review of those practices and our stock option
grants made in the period between 1992 and 2006, a formal investigation by


the SEC relating to our stock option granting
practices remains pending, as does derivative litigation against us and certain
of our current and former directors and officers. Although we believe that we
have taken appropriate action by restating our financial statements for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, as filed in our Amended Annual Report on Form
10-K/A on May 25, 2007, and made appropriate disclosures for matters relating
to stock options, the SEC (or the court in the derivative actions) may disagree
with the findings of the Special Subcommittee or with the manner in which we
have accounted for and reported, or not reported, the financial impact of past
option grant measurement date errors. If so, we may need to further restate our
prior financial statements, further amend our filings with the SEC, or take
other actions not currently contemplated. In addition, these proceedings are
likely to result in additional legal expense that may affect our results in
future periods, and may also result in diversion of management attention and
other resources, as well as fines, penalties, damages and other sanctions. These
eventualities could materially and adversely affect our business and results of
operations. We cannot currently predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings.

We had a material weakness in internal
control over financial reporting and cannot assure you that additional material
weaknesses will not be identified in the future. If our internal control over
financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective,
there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a
restatement or our filings may not be timely and investors may lose confidence
in our reported financial information, which could lead to a decline in our
stock price.

Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year, and to
include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting in each Annual Report on Form 10-K. Section 404 also
requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, and
report on, management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
In assessing the findings of the Special Subcommittee’s review and the
restatement set forth in our Amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2006, our management concluded that there was a material
weakness, as defined in the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s
Auditing Standard No. 2, in our internal control over financial reporting as of
March 31, 2006. Our management concluded that this weakness was remedied as of
March 31, 2007 with the adoption of new equity compensation policies and
procedures by the Compensation Committee and Nominating/Corporate Governance
Committees of our Board of Directors and, accordingly, no longer exists as of
the date of this filing. See the discussion included in Part II, Item 9A of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 for
additional information regarding our internal control over financial reporting.

Our management does not expect that our
internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error or all fraud.
A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will
be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of
some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
the controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in
conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or
procedures may occur. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
detected.

As a result, we cannot assure you that
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to
maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we
encounter in their implementation, could result in significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses, cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting
obligations, or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any
such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management
evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting required under Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated thereunder. The
existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial
statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us
to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose
confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our
stock price.

As a result of the delayed filing of certain
of our periodic reports, we will be ineligible to use Form S-3 or Form S-4 for
a period of time. This may adversely affect our ability to engage in certain
types of corporate acquisition and capital-raising transactions.

As a result of our delayed filing of certain
of our periodic reports, we will be ineligible to register our securities on
Form S-3 or Form S-4 for sale by us or resale by other security holders until
we have timely filed all periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 for a period of time. In the meantime, we have the ability


to use Form S-1 to raise capital or complete
acquisitions. The need to use Form S-1, and the inability to use Form S-3 or
Form S-4, could increase our transaction costs and adversely affect our ability
to engage in certain types of corporate acquisition and capital-raising
transactions until we regain our S-3/S-4 eligibility.

Item 3

.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In July 2006,
individuals and/or entities claiming to be stockholders of the Company have
filed derivative lawsuits, purportedly on behalf of the Company, against
certain current and former members of the Company’s Board of Directors as well
as several current and former officers of the Company. Three derivative actions
have been filed in Los Angeles Superior Court: Vazquez v. Kotick, et al

.

, L.A.S.C. Case No. BC355327 (filed July 12, 2006); Greuer
v. Kotick, et al.

,

L.A.S.C. Case No. SC090343
(filed July 12, 2006); and Amalgamated Bank v. Baker, et al., L.A.S.C.


Case No.
BC356454 (filed August 3, 2006). These actions have been consolidated by the
court under the caption In re Activision Shareholder Derivative Litigation, L.A.S.C.
Master File No. SC090343 (West, J.). Two derivative actions have been filed in
the United States District Court for the Central District of California:
Pfeiffer v. Kotick, et al., C.D. Cal. Case No. CV06-4771 MRP (JTLx) (filed July
31, 2006); and Hamian v. Kotick, et al

.

, C.D. Cal.
Case No. CV06-5375 MRP (JLTx) (filed August 25, 2006). These actions have also
been consolidated, under the caption In re Activision, Inc. Shareholder
Derivative Litigation, C.D. Cal. Case No. CV06-4771 MRP (JTLx) (Pfaelzer, J.). The
consolidated complaints allege, among other things, purported improprieties in
the Company’s issuance of stock options. Plaintiffs seek various relief on
behalf of the Company, including damages, restitution of benefits obtained from
the alleged misconduct, equitable relief, including an accounting and
rescission of option contracts; and various corporate governance reforms. The
Company expects that defense expenses associated with the matters will be
covered by its directors and officers insurance, subject to the terms and
conditions of the applicable policies. On May 24, 2007, the Superior Court
granted the Company’s motion to stay the state action. The court’s order stays
the action pending the resolution of motions to dismiss in the federal action,
but is without prejudice to any party’s right to seek modification of the stay
upon a showing of good cause, including a showing that matters may be addressed
in the Superior Court without the potential for conflict with or duplication of
the federal court proceedings. The Company filed motions to dismiss in the
federal action on June 1, 2007, which will be fully briefed by August 15, 2007.
The Company was also informed that, on June 1, 2007, a derivative case,
Abdelnur vs. Kotick et al., was filed in the United States District Court for
the Central District of California, C.D. Case No. CV07-3575 AHM (PJWx), by the
same law firm that previously filed the Hamian case, alleging substantially the
same claims.

On July
27, 2006, the Company received a letter of informal inquiry from the SEC
requesting certain documents and information relating to the Company’s
historical stock option grant practices. In early June 2007, the SEC informed
the Company that the SEC has issued a formal order of non-public investigation,
which allows the SEC, among other things, to subpoena witnesses and to require
the production of documents. The Company is cooperating with the SEC’s
investigation, and representatives of the special subcommittee of independent
members of our Board of Directors established in July 2006 to review our
historical stock option granting practices (the “Special Subcommittee”) and its
legal counsel have met with members of the staff of the SEC on several
occasions, in person and by telephone (as has the Company’s outside legal
counsel), to discuss the progress of the Special Subcommittee’s investigation
and on February 28, 2007 to brief the SEC staff on the Special Subcommittee’s
findings and recommendations following the substantial completion of the Special
Subcommittee’s investigation. A representative of the U.S. Department of
Justice has attended certain of these meetings and requested copies of certain
documents that we have provided to the staff of the SEC. At this time, the
Company has not received any grand jury subpoenas or written requests from the
Department of Justice.

In addition,
we are party to other routine claims and suits brought by us and against us in
the ordinary course of business, including disputes arising over the ownership
of intellectual property rights, contractual claims, employment relationships,
and collection matters. In the opinion of management, after consultation with
legal counsel, the outcome of such routine claims and lawsuits will not have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations, or liquidity.

Cash Dividends

We paid no

cash dividends at any time in the foreseeable future. We expect that earnings
will be retained for the continued growth and development of the business. Future
dividends, if any, will depend upon our earnings, financial condition, cash
requirements, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board
of Directors.

Stock Splits

In April 2003, the Board of Directors approved a three-for-two split of
our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. The
split was paid on June 6, 2003 to shareholders of record as of May 16, 2003. In
February 2004, the Board of Directors approved a second three-for-two split of
our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. The
split was paid on March 15, 2004 to shareholders of record as of February 23,
2004. In February 2005, the Board of Directors approved a four-for-three split
of our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 33-1/3% stock
dividend. The split was paid on March 22, 2005 to shareholders of record as of
March 7, 2005. In September 2005, the Board of Directors approved a
four-for-three split of our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a
33-1/3% stock dividend. The split was paid October 24, 2005 to shareholders of
record as of October 10, 2005. The par value of our common stock was maintained
at the pre-split amount of $.000001. All share and per share data have been restated
as if the stock splits had occurred as of the earliest period presented.

On March 7, 2005, in connection with our March 22, 2005 stock split,
all shares of common stock held as treasury stock were formally cancelled and
restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

Buyback Program

During fiscal 2003, our Board of Directors authorized
a buyback program under which we can repurchase up to $350.0 million of our
common stock. Under the program, shares may be purchased as determined by
management, from time to time and within certain guidelines, in the open market
or in privately negotiated transactions, including privately negotiated
structured stock repurchase transactions and through transactions in the
options markets. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these
purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time
without prior notice.

Under the buyback program, we did not repurchase any
shares of our common stock in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2006, or
2005. We repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares of our common stock for
$12.4 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. In addition,
approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock were acquired in the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2004 as a result of the settlement of $10.0 million of
structured stock repurchase transactions entered into in fiscal 2003. As of
March 31, 2007, we had no outstanding structured stock repurchase transactions.
Structured stock repurchase transactions are settled in cash or stock based on
the market price of our common stock on the date of the settlement. Upon
settlement, we either have our capital investment returned with a premium or
receive shares of our common stock, depending, respectively, on whether the
market price of our common stock is above or below a pre-determined price
agreed in connection with each such transaction.

Shareholders’ Rights Plan

On April 18,
2000, our Board of Directors approved a shareholders rights plan (the “Rights
Plan”). Under the Rights Plan, each common shareholder at the close of business
on April 19, 2000 received a dividend of one right for each share of common
stock held. Each right represents the right to purchase one six-hundredths
(1/600) of a share, as adjusted on account of stock dividends made since the
plan’s adoption, of our Series A Junior Preferred Stock at an exercise price of
$6.67, as adjusted on account of stock dividends made since the plan’s adoption.
Initially, the rights are represented by our common stock certificates and are
neither exercisable nor traded separately from our common stock. The rights
will only become exercisable if a person or group acquires 15% or more of the
common stock of Activision, or announces or commences a tender or exchange
offer which would result in the bidder’s beneficial ownership of 15% or more of
our common stock.


In the event
that any person or group acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock,
each holder of a right (other than such person or members of such group) will
thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such right, in lieu of
shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock, the number of shares of common stock
of Activision having a value equal to two times the then current exercise price
of the right. If we are acquired in a merger or other business combination
transaction after a person has acquired 15% or more of our common stock, each
holder of a right will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of
such right a number of the acquiring company’s common shares having a market
value equal to two times the then current exercise price of the right. For
persons who, as of the close of business on April 18, 2000, beneficially own
15% or more of the common stock of Activision, the Rights Plan “grandfathers”
their current level of ownership, so long as they do not purchase additional
shares in excess of certain limitations.

We may redeem
the rights for $0.01 per right at any time until the first public announcement
of the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 15% of our common stock. At any
time after a person has acquired 15% or more (but before any person has
acquired more than 50%) of our common stock, we may exchange all or part of the
rights for shares of common stock at an exchange ratio of one share of common
stock per right. The rights expire on April 18, 2010.

Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Our Business

We are a
leading international publisher of interactive entertainment software products.
We have built a company with a diverse portfolio of products that spans a wide
range of categories and target markets and that are used on a variety of game
hardware platforms and operating systems. We have created, licensed, and
acquired a group of highly recognizable brands, which we market to a variety of
consumer demographics. Our fiscal 2007 product portfolio includes titles such
as

Over the Hedge, X-Men: The Official Game, Marvel:
Ultimate Alliance, Tony Hawk’s Project 8, Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam, Call of
Duty 3,

and

Guitar Hero 2.

Our products
cover diverse game categories including action/adventure, action sports,
racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person action, music-based gaming, and
strategy. Our target customer base ranges from casual players to game
enthusiasts, children to adults, and mass-market consumers to “value” buyers. We
currently offer our products primarily in versions that operate on the Sony
PlayStation 2 (“PS2”), the Sony PlayStation 3 (“PS3”), the Nintendo Wii (“Wii”),
and the Microsoft Xbox360 (“Xbox360”) console systems, the Nintendo Game Boy
Advance (“GBA”), the Nintendo Dual Screen (“NDS”), and the Sony PlayStation
Portable (“PSP”) hand-held devices, and the personal computer (“PC”). The
installed base for the previous generation of hardware platforms (e.g., PS2,
Xbox) is significant and the fiscal 2006 release of the Xbox360 and the fiscal
2007 releases of the PS3 and the Wii will further expand the software market. During
the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we had a successful and significant presence
at the launches of the PS3 and the Wii with three launch titles for the PS3,

Call of Duty 3, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance,

and

Tony Hawk’s Project 8,

and five launch titles for the Wii,

Call of Duty 3, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, World Series of Poker:
Tournament of Champions, Rapala Tournament Fishing,

and

Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam.

Our plan is to continue to build
on our significant launch presence on the PS3, Wii, and Xbox360 (“the
next-generation platforms”) by continuing to expand the number of titles
released on the next generation platforms while continuing to market to
current-generation platforms as long as economically attractive given their
large installed base.

Our publishing
business involves the development, marketing, and sale of products directly, by
license, or through our affiliate label program with certain third party
publishers. In North America, we primarily sell our products on a direct basis
to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and
game specialty stores. We conduct our international publishing activities
through offices in the United Kingdom (“UK”), Germany, France, Italy, Spain,
the Netherlands, Australia, Scandinavia, Canada, South Korea, and Japan. Our
products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third
party distribution and licensing arrangements, and through our wholly owned
European distribution subsidiaries. Our distribution business consists of
operations located in the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany that provide
logistical and sales services to third-party publishers of interactive
entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of
interactive entertainment hardware.

Our profitability is directly affected by the
mix of revenues from our publishing and distribution businesses. Operating
margins realized from our publishing business are typically substantially
higher than margins realized from our distribution business. Operating margins
in our publishing business are affected by our ability to release highly
successful or “hit” titles. Though many of these titles have substantial
production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets, once a title recoups
these costs, incremental net revenues directly and positively impact our
operating margin. Operating margins in our distribution business are affected
by the mix of hardware and software sales, with software typically producing
higher margins than hardware.

Our Focus

With respect to future game development, we will
continue to focus on our “big propositions,” products that are backed by strong
brands and high quality development, for which we will provide significant
marketing support.

Our fiscal 2007 releases have included
well-established brands, which are backed by high-profile intellectual property
and/or highly anticipated motion picture releases. For example, we have a
long-term relationship with Marvel Entertainment, Inc. through an exclusive
licensing agreement for the Spider-Man and X-Men franchises through 2017. This
agreement grants us the exclusive rights to develop and publish video games
based on Marvel’s comic book and movie franchises Spider-Man and X-Men. Through
March 31, 2007, games based on the Spider-Man and X-Men franchises have
generated approximately $852.7 million in net revenues worldwide. Under this
agreement, in the


first quarter of fiscal 2007 we released the video
game,

X-Men: The Official Game

,

coinciding with the theatrical
release of “X-Men: The Last Stand.”  In
the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we
released

Marvel: Ultimate Alliance

across
multiple platforms

and

Spider-Man: Battle for New York

on the NDS
and GBA. In addition, through our licensing agreement with Spider-Man
Merchandising, LP, we developed and published video games based on Columbia
Pictures/Marvel Entertainment, Inc.’s feature film “Spider-Man 3,” which was
released in May 2007.  Our agreement with
Spider-Man Merchandising, LP grants us exclusive worldwide publishing rights to
publish entertainment software products based on subsequent Spider-Man movie
sequels or new television series through 2017.

We also have an exclusive licensing agreement with
professional skateboarder Tony Hawk. The agreement grants us exclusive rights
to develop and publish video games through 2015 using Tony Hawk’s name and
likeness. Through March 31, 2007, we have released eight successful titles in
the Tony Hawk franchise with cumulative net revenues of $1.2 billion, including
the two fiscal 2007 third quarter releases,

Tony
Hawk’s Project 8,

which was
released on the PSP, Xbox360, PS2, and PS3, and

Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam

which was released on the Wii, NDS,
and GBA. According to the NPD Group, which is a provider of consumer and
retail market research information for a wide range of industries, for the
eighth consecutive year the Tony Hawk franchise had a top 10 best-selling game

in the U.S. for the
month of December. We will continue to build on the highly successful Tony Hawk
franchise with future releases currently in development for multiple platforms.

We continue to
develop a number of original intellectual properties internally. For example,
in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 we released

Call of Duty 3

on the PS2, PS3, Xbox, Xbox360, and the Wii. According
to the NPD Group,

Call of Duty 3

was the #3
best-selling console game in the U.S.

Call of Duty 3

was
the sixth release based upon this original intellectual property following two
PC exclusive titles,

Call of Duty

and

Call of Duty: United Offensive,

as
well as multi-platform releases of

Call of
Duty: Finest Hour, Call of Duty: Big Red One,

and

Call
of Duty 2.

We expect to continue to develop a variety of
games on multiple platforms based on this original intellectual property as
well as continue to invest in developing other original intellectual
properties.

We
have continued our focus on establishing and maintaining relationships with
talented and experienced software development and publishing teams. In

June 2006, we acquired RedOctane, Inc. (“RedOctane”), the publisher of the
popular Guitar Hero franchise. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007 we released

Guitar Hero 2

on the PS2, which according to the NPD Group
was the #1 game in dollars for the U.S. for the month of December and the #2
game overall for the third quarter of fiscal 2007. We have also developed

Guitar Hero 2

for the Xbox360 and plan on continuing to
build on this franchise by investing in future development of Guitar Hero
titles across a variety of platforms.

We also have development agreements with other top-level, third-party
developers such as id Software, Inc., Splash Damage, Ltd., and Traveller’s
Tales.

We
will also continue to evaluate and exploit emerging brands that we believe have
potential to become successful game franchises. For example, we have a
multi-year, multi-property, publishing agreement with DreamWorks Animation LLC
that grants us the exclusive rights to publish video games based on DreamWorks
Animation SKG’s theatrical release “Shrek 2,” which was released in the first
quarter of fiscal 2005, “Shark Tale,” which was released in the second quarter
of fiscal 2005, “Madagascar,” which was released in the first quarter of fiscal
2006, “Over the Hedge,” which was released in the first quarter of fiscal 2007,
and all of their respective sequels. In addition, our multi-year agreement with
DreamWorks Animation LLC also grants us the exclusive video game rights to four
upcoming feature films, as well as potential future films in the “Shrek”
franchise beyond the “Shrek the Third.”

Additionally,
we have a

strategic alliance with Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. that
grants us the exclusive, worldwide interactive rights to develop and publish “World
Series of Poker” video games based on the popular World Series of Poker
Tournament. In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we released our first title
under this alliance,

World Series of Poker,

which
became the number one poker title of calendar 2005. Further building on this
franchise, in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we released our second title
under this alliance,

World Series of Poker:
Tournament of Champions

.

We also continue to build on our portfolio of licensed intellectual
property. In February 2006, we signed an agreement with Hasbro Properties Group
granting us the exclusive global rights (excluding Japan) to develop console,
hand-held, and PC games based on Hasbro’s “Transformers” brand. We anticipate
releasing the first game concurrently with the July 2007 movie release of the
live action “Transformers” film from DreamWorks Pictures and Paramount Pictures.
In April 2006, we signed an agreement with MGM Interactive and EON Productions Ltd.
granting us the exclusive rights to develop and publish interactive
entertainment games based on the James Bond license through 2014. In May 2006,
we signed a multi-year agreement with Mattel, Inc. which grants us the
exclusive


worldwide
distribution rights to new video games on all platforms based on Mattel, Inc.’s

Barbie

brand. In the third quarter of
fiscal 2006, we distributed six

Barbie

titles:

Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses, The Barbie Diaries: High School
Mystery, Barbie Fashion Show, Barbie Horse Adventures: Mystery Ride, Barbie and
the Magic of Pegasus,

and

Barbie as the Princess and
the Pauper.

In September 2006, we entered into a distribution
agreement with MTV Networks Kids and Family Group’s Nickelodeon, a division of
Viacom Inc., to be the exclusive distributor of three new Nick Jr. PC CD-ROM
titles, published by Nickelodeon and based on the top preschool series on
commercial television,

Dora The Explorer, The
Backyardigans,

and

Go, Diego, Go!.

We are utilizing these
developer relationships, new intellectual property acquisitions, new original
intellectual property creations, and our existing library of intellectual
property to further focus our game development on product lines that will
deliver significant, lasting, and recurring revenues and operating profits.

Critical
Accounting Policies

We have identified the policies below as critical to our business
operations and the understanding of our financial results. The impact and any
associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is
discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and
expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of
these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue from the sale of our
products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers. Certain
products are sold to customers with a street date (i.e., a date on which
products are made widely available by retailers). For these products we
recognize revenue no earlier than the street date. Revenue from product sales
is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price
protection. With respect to license agreements that provide customers the right
to make multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenue is
recognized upon delivery of such copies. Per copy royalties on sales that
exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned. With respect to on-line
transactions, such as electronic downloads of titles or product add-ons,
revenue is recognized when the fee is paid by the on-line customer to purchase
online content and we are notified by the online retailer that the product has
been downloaded. In addition, in order to recognize revenue for both product
sales and licensing transactions, persuasive evidence of an arrangement must
exist and collection of the related receivable must be probable. Revenue
recognition also determines the timing of certain expenses, including “cost of
sales – intellectual property licenses” and “cost of sales – software royalties
and amortization.”

Sales incentives or other
consideration given by us to our customers are accounted for in accordance with
the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer
(Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products).”  In accordance with EITF Issue 01-9, sales
incentives and other consideration that are considered adjustments of the
selling price of our products, such as rebates and product placement fees, are
reflected as reductions of revenue. Sales incentives and other consideration
that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received, such as
the appearance of our products in a customer’s national circular ad, are
reflected as sales and marketing expenses.

Allowances for Returns, Price Protection, Doubtful Accounts,
and Inventory Obsolescence.

In determining the appropriate unit shipments to our customers, we
benchmark our titles using historical and industry data. We closely monitor and analyze the historical
performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by
other publishers and the anticipated timing of other releases in order to
assess future demands of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes
shipped upon title launch and subsequent reorders are evaluated to ensure that
quantities are sufficient to meet the demands from the retail markets but at
the same time, are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel.

We
may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers
under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the
circumstances when we elect to decrease the wholesale price of a product by a
certain amount and, when granted and applicable, allows customers a credit
against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and/or future
invoices. The conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to
return products or price protection are, among other things, compliance with
applicable payment terms, and consistent delivery to us of inventory and
sell-through reports. We may also consider other factors, including the
facilitation of


slow-moving inventory and
other market factors. Management must make estimates of potential future
product returns and price protection related to current period product revenue.
We estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for current
period product revenue utilizing historical experience and information
regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the
end consumer. The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future
returns and price protection for a particular title:  historical performance of titles in similar
genres, historical performance of the hardware platform, historical performance
of the brand, console hardware life cycle, Activision sales force and retail
customer feedback, industry pricing, weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory,
absolute quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory, our warehouse on-hand
inventory levels, the title’s recent sell-through history (if available),
marketing trade programs, and competing titles. The relative importance of
these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other items, genre,
platform, seasonality, and sales strategy. Significant management judgments and
estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance
for returns and price protection in any accounting period. Based upon
historical experience we believe our estimates are reasonable. However, actual
returns and price protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates
due to a number of reasons including, among others, a lack of consumer
acceptance of a title, the release in the same period of a similarly themed
title by a competitor, or technological obsolescence due to the emergence of new
hardware platforms. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of
our revenue for any period if factors or market conditions change or if
management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in
determining the allowances for returns and price protection. For example, a 1%
change in our March 31, 2007 allowance for returns and price protection would
impact net revenues by $0.9 million.

Similarly,
management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts
receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze the
age of current outstanding account balances, historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes
in our customers’ payment terms and their economic condition, as well as
whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance. Any significant changes in
any of these criteria would affect management’s estimates in establishing our
allowance for doubtful accounts.

We
value inventory at the lower of cost or market. We regularly review inventory
quantities on hand and in the retail channel and record a provision for excess
or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products.
Significant changes in demand for our products would impact management’s
estimates in establishing our inventory provision.

Software Development Costs.

Software development costs include payments
made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well
as direct costs incurred for internally developed products.

We
account for software development costs in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.”  Software development costs are capitalized
once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs
are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product
encompasses both technical design documentation and game design documentation. For
products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the
development cycle. Technological feasibility is evaluated on a
product-by-product basis. Prior to a product’s release, we expense, as part of “cost
of sales — software royalties and amortization,” capitalized costs when we
believe such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized costs for those products
that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in
the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are
not capitalized are charged immediately to product development expense. We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.
The recoverability of capitalized
software development costs is evaluated based on the expected performance of
the specific products for which the costs relate. Criteria used to
evaluate expected product performance include: 
historical performance of comparable products using comparable
technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and estimated
performance of a sequel product based on the performance of the product on
which the sequel is based.

Commencing
upon product release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to “cost
of sales — software royalties and amortization” based on the ratio of current
revenues to total projected revenues, generally resulting in an amortization
period of six months or less. For products that have been released in prior
periods, we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a
quarterly basis. The primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance.

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when
technological feasibility is established, as well as in the ongoing assessment
of the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating


the recoverability of
capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes
forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If
revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than and/or revised
forecasted or actual costs are greater than the original forecasted amounts
utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may
be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in
an impairment charge.

Intellectual Property Licenses.

Intellectual property license costs represent
license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their
trademarks, copyrights, software, technology, or other intellectual property or
proprietary rights in the development of our products. Depending upon the
agreement with the rights holder, we may obtain the rights to use acquired
intellectual property in multiple products over multiple years, or
alternatively, for a single product.

We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized intellectual property
licenses on a quarterly basis. The recoverability of capitalized intellectual
property license costs is evaluated based on the expected performance of the
specific products in which the licensed trademark or copyright is to be used. As
many of our intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over
multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual
property license costs based on certain qualitative factors such as the success
of other products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual
property, whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or
television series based on the intellectual property, and the rights holder’s
continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property. Prior to the
related product’s release, we expense, as part of “cost of sales — intellectual
property licenses,” capitalized intellectual property costs when we believe
such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized intellectual property costs for
those products that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product
development expense in the period of cancellation. Criteria used to evaluate
expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable
products using comparable technology; orders for the product prior to its
release; and estimated performance of a sequel product based on the performance
of the product on which the sequel is based.

Commencing
upon the related product’s release, capitalized intellectual property license
costs are amortized to “cost of sales — intellectual property licenses” based
on the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected
revenues for all products in which the licensed property will be utilized. As
intellectual property license contracts may extend for multiple years, the
amortization of capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to
such contracts may extend beyond one year. For intellectual property included
in products that have been released and unreleased products, we evaluate the
future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis. The primary
evaluation criterion is actual title performance.

Significant management judgments and estimates are
utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs.

In evaluating the recoverability of
capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes
forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If
revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than, and/or revised
forecasted or actual costs are greater than, the original forecasted amounts
utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may
be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in
an impairment charge. Additionally, as noted above, as many of our intellectual
property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple years, we also
assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs
based on certain qualitative factors such as the success of other products
and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property, whether
there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series based on
the intellectual property and the rights holder’s continued promotion and
exploitation of the intellectual property. Material differences may result in the
amount and timing of charges for any period if management makes different
judgments or utilizes different estimates in evaluating these qualitative
factors.

Stock-Based Compensation.

On April 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS
123R”), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense
for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including
employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (“employee stock purchases”), based on estimated fair
values. SFAS 123R supersedes our previous accounting under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
(“APB 25”). In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 107 (“SAB 107”) relating to SFAS 123R. We have applied the provisions
of SAB 107 in our adoption of SFAS 123R

.

We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method,
which requires the application of the accounting standard as of April 1, 2006,
the first day of our fiscal year 2007. The Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 reflect the
impact of SFAS 123R. In


accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not been restated to
reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123R. See Note 14 for
additional information.

In
November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB
Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 123(R)-3, “Transition Election Related to
Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards” (“FSP 123R-3”). We
have elected not to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FSP
123R-3 for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to
SFAS 123R. We followed paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123R to calculate the initial
pool of excess tax benefits and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC
pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee
stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS
123R.

SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based
payment awards on the measurement date using an option-pricing model. The value
of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized
as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statement of
Operations. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS 123R for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 was $25.5 million. Prior to the adoption of
SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for stock-based awards to employees and
directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25 as allowed
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”).

Under APB 25, compensation expense was
recorded for the issuance of stock options and other stock-based compensation
based on the intrinsic value of the stock options and other stock-based
compensation on the date of grant or measurement date. Under the intrinsic
value method, compensation expense was recorded on the measurement date only if
the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the stock option or
other stock-based award’s exercise price. For the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2006 and 2005, we recognized $3.1 million and $3.4 million,
respectively, in stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock
options and restricted stock, under APB 25. See Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based
on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that is ultimately
expected to vest during the period. Stock-based compensation expense recognized
in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2007 includes compensation expense for share-based payment awards granted
prior to, but not yet vested as of, April 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair
value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS 123, and
compensation expense for the share-based payment awards granted subsequent to
April 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS 123R. As stock-based compensation expense recognized in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2007 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for
estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the
time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates.

As of April 1, 2005, we changed our method of valuation for share-based
awards to a binomial-lattice model from the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
(“Black-Scholes model”) which was used for options granted prior to April 1,
2005 for FAS 123 fair value disclosures. For additional information, see Note
14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our determination of fair value of
share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model
is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of
highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not
limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and
actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.


Selected
Consolidated Statements of Operations Data

table sets forth certain Consolidated Statements of Operations data for the
periods indicated as a percentage of consolidated net revenues and also breaks
down net revenues by territory, business segment, and platform, as well as
operating income by business segment (in thousands):


Results of
Operations – Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2007 and 2006

Net
Revenues

We primarily derive revenue from sales of
packaged interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles
(such as the PS2, PS3, Xbox360, and Wii), PCs, and hand-held game devices (such
as the GBA, NDS, and PSP). We also derive revenue from our distribution
business in Europe that provides logistical and sales services to third-party
publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations
and third-party manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

The following
table details our consolidated net revenues by business segment and our
publishing net revenues by territory for the years ended March 31, 2007 and
2006 (in thousands):

Consolidated
net revenues increased 3% from $1,468.0 million for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2006 to $1,513.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. This
increase in consolidated net revenues was driven by the following:

•

Strong performance of our North American
publishing unit led to a year over year increase in net revenues of $43.3
million or 6%. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we released a focused but
high quality slate of titles, which resulted in strong consumer demand for our
new releases in the third quarter, continuing reorders in the fourth quarter
and strong price realization. In fiscal 2007, our major releases included

Call of Duty 3, Guitar Hero 2, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Tony Hawk’s
Project 8, Over the Hedge, X-Men: Official Game, Shrek Smash N’ Crash, Tony
Hawk’s Downhill Jam

,

Series of Poker Tournament
of Champions, Pimp My Ride

, and titles for our Cabela’s, History
Channel and new Barbie franchises

.

In fiscal
2006, we released the following major releases:

Doom 3

for
the Xbox,

Madagascar, Fantastic Four, Ultimate Spider-Man,
X-Men Legends II, THAW, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, GUN, True
Crime: New York City, Quake 4, Shrek SuperSlam, The Movies, Cabela’s Dangerous
Hunts 2,

and

World Series of Poker.

•

An increase in net revenues from our
distribution business due to a stronger release schedule for certain
third-party publishers, higher revenues from hardware sales related to the
launch of PS3 and Nintendo Wii, as well as ongoing sales of NDS and PSP, and
the addition of a significant new customer in the second quarter of fiscal
2007.

•

Impact of the year over year strengthening of
the Great Britain Pound (“GBP”), Euro (“EUR”) and Australian Dollar (“AUD”)  in relation to the United States Dollar (“USD”).
Foreign exchange rates increased reported net revenues by approximately $51.6
million or 4% for the year ended March 31, 2007. Excluding the impact of
changing foreign currency rates, our consolidated net revenues remained about
in line with prior year.

Partially offset by:

•

A
decrease in publishing net revenues from our European publishing operations
primarily due to a more focused slate in fiscal 2007, and a decrease in our
affiliate business as only one title, LucasArts’

Star Wars


Lego 2

was released in 2007, whereas two strong affiliate titles, LucasArts’

Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith

and

LucasArts’

Star Wars Battlefront II,

were released in fiscal 2006.

In fiscal 2008, we plan to
leverage our traditional core franchises, such as Spiderman, Shrek, Call of
Duty and Tony Hawk, and extend our market leadership in the music-based gaming
genre with Guitar Hero. In addition, we expect strong market growth as the next
generation consoles gain critical mass. As a result, we anticipate revenues
will increase in fiscal 2008 in comparison to the record net revenues achieved
in fiscal 2007.

North America Publishing Net Revenues (in
thousands)

North America publishing net revenues
increased 6% from $710.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2006 to $753.4
million for the year ended March 31, 2007. Although the company released fewer
titles in fiscal 2007, the high quality slate drove strong consumer demand and
enabled the company to maintain pricing and record lower provisions for returns
and price protection than in fiscal 2006. Net revenues were impacted by strong
performances from

Guitar Hero 2, Call of Duty 3, Marvel:
Ultimate Alliance

and

Tony Hawk’s Project 8

.
North America publishing net revenues increased as a percentage of consolidated
net revenues from 48% for the year ended March 31, 2006 to 50% for the year
ended March 31, 2007. The increase in the percentage of consolidated net
revenues is due to a combination of strong performance in North America and a
decrease in our international publishing net revenues due to a smaller slate
and a decrease in the number of affiliate titles in Europe released in fiscal
2007.

International Publishing Net Revenues (in
thousands)

International
publishing net revenues decreased by 18% from $444.6 million for the year ended
March 31, 2006 to $365.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2007. Additionally,
international publishing net revenues as a percentage of consolidated net
revenues decreased from 30% for the year ended March 31, 2006 to 24% for the
year ended March 31, 2007. The decrease in international publishing net
revenues was primarily due to the decrease in the number of titles released
internationally in fiscal 2007. Additionally, in Europe, our net revenues were
impacted by a decrease in revenues from our affiliate titles. Fiscal 2006
included the successful LucasArts’ titles,

Star Wars: Revenge of the
Sith

and

Star Wars Battlefront II,

while
fiscal 2007 included one major affiliate label release, LucasArts’

Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy

. The decrease in
international publishing net revenues was partially offset by a year over year
strengthening of the EUR and the GBP in relation to the USD, which increased
reported net revenues for fiscal 2007 by approximately $24.2 million. Excluding
the impact of changing foreign currency rates, our international publishing net
revenues decreased 23% year over year.


Publishing Net Revenues by Platform

Publishing net revenues decreased 3% from
$1,154.7 million

for the year ended March 31, 2006

to
$1,119.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2007. The following table details
our publishing net revenues by platform and as a percentage of total publishing
net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 (in thousands):

Personal Computer Net Revenues (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the PC
decreased 57% from $183.5 million and 16% of publishing net revenues for the
year ended March 31, 2006 to $78.9 million and 7% of publishing net revenues
for the year ended March 31, 2007. The decreases were primarily due to the
strong performance of our fiscal 2006 PC releases, as well as a decrease in the
number of titles released for the PC during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal
2006. In fiscal 2006, we released the highly successful PC title,

Call of Duty 2

, which was ranked by NPD Funworld as the
number two best selling PC title in the United States for the third quarter of
fiscal 2006, as well as

Quake 4

,

The Movies

, and

Doom 3: Resurrection of
Evil

. This compares to fiscal 2007 where net revenues were primarily
derived from catalog sales of

Call of Duty 2

,

Quake 4

and

The Movies

,
as well as revenues from our European affiliate title LucasArts’

Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy

.


We expect fiscal 2008 PC publishing net
revenues to increase due to the release of

Enemy Territory: Quake Wars,

and

Call of Duty 4,

as well as PC
releases of large scale movie titles (

Spider Man the Movie 3, Shrek the Third and

Transformers

).

Quake

and

Call of Duty

had
no PC releases in the fiscal 2007 base period and should attract a significant
audience on the PC platform in fiscal 2008.

Sony PlayStation 3 Net Revenues (in
thousands)

The PS3 was released in November 2006 in North America and in March
2007 in Europe. Consistent with our goal of having a significant presence at
the launch of each new platform, we released three titles concurrently with the
hardware releases:

Call of Duty 3, Marvel:
Ultimate Alliance,

and

Tony Hawk’s Project 8

.
All of these titles were released at premium retail pricing (i.e. $59.99 in the
United States).

We
expect net revenues from sales of titles for the PS3 to increase as the
installed base of hardware grows.

Sony PlayStation 2 Net Revenues (in
thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the PS2 increased 19% from $422.2
million for the year ended March 31, 2006 to $500.9 million for the year ended
March 31, 2007. Although we released a fewer number of major titles for the PS2
in fiscal 2007, the strong performance of these releases, particularly the PS2
exclusive title Guitar Hero 2, resulted in higher net revenues in absolute
dollars and as a percentage of publishing net revenues. The key titles
impacting the fiscal 2007 results were

Call of Duty 3

,
the #3 title overall for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 according to NPD
Funworld, and

Guitar Hero 2

(game and
accessories), the #1 best selling title on the PS2 platform for the third
quarter of fiscal 2007 per NPD Funworld. In addition, we released

Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Over the Hedge, Tony Hawk’s Project 8,
X-Men: The Official Game, Shrek Smash N’ Crash Racing

and our
European affiliate title, LucasArts’

Star Wars Lego 2

.
This compares to fiscal 2006 where we released the PS2 titles

Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, Tony Hawk’s American Wasteland, Shrek
SuperSlam, GUN, True Crime: New York City, Madagascar, Fantastic Four, X-Men
Legends 2, Ultimate Spiderman

and two affiliate titles in Europe

,

LucasArts’

Star Wars: Revenge of the
Sith

and

Star Wars Battlefront II.

Although we expect net revenues from sales of titles for the PS2 to
decline over time as consumers transition to next generation platforms, we
continue to expect significant net revenues for PS2 for fiscal 2008 as we plan
to develop and release many of our key titles on this platform.


Microsoft Xbox360 Net Revenues (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the Xbox360 increased 95% from
$102.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2006 to $200.4 million for the year
ended March 31, 2007. As a percentage of publishing net revenues, net revenues
from sales of titles for the Xbox360 doubled from 9% for the year ended March
31, 2006 to 18% for the year ended March 31, 2007. These increases are due to
the growing installed base for the Xbox360, as well as an increase in the
number of titles released. In fiscal 2007, we released ten titles for this
platform, and according to NPD Funworld, three of our titles,

Call of Duty 3, Tony Hawk’s Project 8

and

Marvel: Ultimate Alliance

ranked among the top ten Xbox 360
titles during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, we released
four titles concurrently with the November 2005 launch of the Xbox360 hardware,

Call of Duty 2, THAW, Quake 4,

and

GUN,

and we experienced strong sales for these four titles
although limited by hardware availability.

We expect net revenues from sales of titles for the XBox360 to
significantly increase in the upcoming fiscal year due to the growing installed
base and our strong slate of Xbox360 titles.

Microsoft Xbox Net Revenues (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the Xbox decreased 74% from $205.9
million for the year ended March 31, 2006 to $54.2 million for the year ended
March 31, 2007. As a percentage of publishing net revenues, net revenues from
sales of titles for the Xbox decreased from 18% for the year ended March 31,
2006 to 5% for the year ended March 31, 2007. These decreases were primarily
attributable to a slowdown in sales for the Xbox as customers upgrade to the
Xbox360, and the reduction in the number of titles released by us for this
platform. In fiscal 2007 we released five major titles for Xbox:

Call of Duty 3, Tony Hawk’s Project 8, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Over
the Hedge

and

X-Men: The Official Game.

In fiscal 2006, we released our largest slate including

Call of
Duty: Big Red One, Tony Hawk’s American Wasteland, GUN, Ultimate Spiderman,
X-Men Legends 2, True Crime: New York City, Shrek: SuperSlam, Madagascar,
Fantastic Four

and the Xbox exclusive

, Doom 3.

We expect our fiscal 2008 net revenues from sales of titles for the
Xbox to decrease as consumers transition to next generation platforms and as we
stop developing new titles for this platform.

Nintendo Wii Net Revenues (in thousands)

The Nintendo Wii was released in November 2006. Consistent with our
goal of having a significant presence at the launch of each next generation
platform, we released five titles concurrently with the release of Wii;


Call of Duty 3, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, World Series of Poker:
Tournament of Champions, Rapala Tournament Fishing

,
and

Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam.

With the
strong consumer demand for the platform, our five releases performed well,
three of which were top ten Wii titles in the third quarter of fiscal 2007,
according to NPD Funworld:

Call of Duty 3, Marvel
Ultimate Alliance and Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam.

We expect net revenues from sales of titles for the Wii to
significantly increase with the growth of the installed base and an increase in
the number of titles on our slate for fiscal 2008. Due to its mass market
appeal, we believe that the Wii will provide a significant opportunity for us
in the upcoming fiscal years.

Nintendo GameCube Net Revenues (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the
Nintendo GameCube decreased 72% from $81.0 million for the year ended March 31,
2006 to $22.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2007. The decrease in
absolute dollars and as a percentage of publishing net revenues reflects a
decrease in the number of new releases in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006
and a significant slowdown in sales on the GameCube platform as customers
transition to the next generation platforms. In fiscal 2006, we released nine
major titles:

Madagascar, Tony Hawk’s American Wasteland,
Ultimate Spiderman, Fantastic Four, Call of Duty: Big Red One, True Crime: New
York City, GUN, Shrek Super Slam

and

X-Men
Legends 2.

This compares to fiscal 2007 when we released four
titles:

Over the Hedge, X-Men: The Official Game, Shrek
Smash N’ Crash Racing,

and

our European
affiliate title,

Star Wars Lego 2.

We
expect net revenues for the GameCube to significantly decrease in fiscal 2008. Net
revenues will be generated from catalog sales only, as we will no longer
develop titles for this platform.

Hand-held (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the hand-held platforms decreased
3% from $158.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2006 to $153.4 million for
the year ended March 31, 2007. Hand-held net revenues as a percentage of
publishing net revenues decreased slightly from 14% to 13%. Within the
hand-held platforms, net revenues for the GBA platform decreased 39%, from
$79.7 million for the prior fiscal year, to $48.5 million for fiscal 2007, PSP
decreased by 4%, from $52.0 million to $49.9 million, and net revenues for the
NDS doubled from $27.1 million for fiscal 2006 to $54.9 million for the current
year. The decrease in net revenues for GBA is primarily related to slower GBA
sales due to wider acceptance of the NDS platform. The net revenue increase for
NDS reflects the strong performance of our key fiscal 2007 titles which
includes

Over the Hedge, Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam, X-Men:
The Official Game, Spider-Man: Battle for New York

and LucasArts’

Star Wars Lego 2

in Europe, as the platform continued to
gain consumer acceptance and market share. PSP net revenues for fiscal 2007
were slightly lower than the previous year. In fiscal 2006, we released a
stronger PSP slate and our titles performed well with the consumer excitement
for the March 2005 North America platform launch, and the September 2005
European platform launch. The 2006 slate included

Tony Hawk’s
Underground 2, Spider-Man: The Movie 2, X-Men Legends 2, World Series of Poker,

and two affiliate titles in Europe. Our key releases in fiscal 2007

were Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Tony Hawk’s Project 8, Call of Duty:
Roads to Victory,

and one European affiliate title, LucasArts’

Star Wars Lego 2.

With
the installed base of the NDS and PSP continuing to increase, we expect that
fiscal 2008 hand-held net revenues to continue to increase year over year.


Overall

The
platform mix of our future publishing net revenues will likely be impacted by a
number of factors, including the ability of hardware manufacturers to continue
to increase their installed hardware base for the next-generation platforms, as
well as the performance of key product releases from our product release
schedule. We expect that net revenues from console titles will continue to
represent the largest component of our publishing net revenues with Xbox 360
having the largest percentage of that business in fiscal 2008 due to its large
installed hardware base and our strong slate of titles. We expect significant
growth in net revenues from PS3 and Wii next-generation console systems and a
decrease in the percentage of PS2 business in fiscal 2008. With the installed
base of the NDS and PSP platforms continuing to increase, we also expect to see
a continued increase in our hand-held business in line with the growth in the
installed base. Our net revenues from PC titles will be primarily driven by our
product release schedule.

A significant portion of our
revenues and profits are derived from a relatively small number of popular
titles and brands each year and revenues and profits are significantly affected
by our ability to release highly successful “hit” titles. For example, for the
year ended March 31, 2007, 29% of our consolidated net revenues and 39% of
worldwide publishing net revenues were derived from net revenues from our

Call of Duty 3, Guitar Hero 2, and Marvel:  Ultimate Alliance

titles. Though
many of these titles have substantial production or acquisition costs and
marketing budgets, once a title recoups these costs, incremental net revenues
directly and positively impact operating profits resulting in a
disproportionate amount of operating income being derived from these select
titles. We expect that a limited number of titles and brands will continue to
produce a disproportionately large amount of our net revenues and profits.

Three key factors that could affect future publishing and distribution
net revenue performance are console hardware pricing, software pricing, and
transitions in console platforms.  As console hardware moves through its
life cycle, hardware manufacturers typically enact price reductions. 
Reductions in the price of console hardware typically result in an increase in
the installed base of hardware owned by consumers.  Historically, we have
seen that lower console hardware prices put downward pressure on software
pricing.  However, we expect console software launch pricing for the
Xbox360 and PS3 to hold at current levels as a result of the strong consumer
acceptance of these price points that has occurred since the launch of the next
generation platforms and the greater product capability and value of next
generation titles. We continue to expect software pricing on PS2 to hold at
$39.99 with continued momentum on this platform. We will not be launching any
new NGC or Xbox title in fiscal year 2008.

Distribution Net Revenues (in thousands)

Distribution
net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2007 increased 26% from the prior
fiscal year, from $313.3 million to $394.0 million. Foreign exchange
rates increased reported distribution net revenues by approximately $27.3
million for the year ended March 31, 2007.

Excluding the impact of the
changing foreign currency rates, our distribution net revenues increased $53.3
million or 17% year over year.

This
year over year increase was primarily due to the strong releases for certain
third-party publishers, increased hardware sales primarily related to the
launch of two new platforms in fiscal 2007, the PS3 and the Nintendo Wii, as
well as ongoing sales of NDS and PSP hardware, and the addition of a new
customer in the second quarter of fiscal 2007.

The mix of
distribution net revenues between hardware and software sales varied year over
year with approximately 17% of distribution net revenues from hardware sales in
the year ended March 31, 2007 as compared to 20% in the prior fiscal year. Fiscal
2007 results included the hardware releases of the Nintendo Wii in November
2006 and the PS3 in late March 2007. Fiscal 2006 included the release of the
PSP in Europe in the second quarter and the Xbox360 in November 2005. The mix
of future distribution net revenues will be driven by a number of factors
including the occurrence of further hardware price reductions instituted by
hardware manufacturers, and our ability to establish and maintain distribution
agreements with hardware manufacturers, third-party software publishers and
retail customers.


We expect our
fiscal 2008 distribution net revenues to decrease in absolute dollars and as a
percentage of consolidated net revenues when compared with fiscal 2007
primarily due to the loss of a customer at the end of fiscal 2007 and strong
growth of our publishing business.

Costs and Expenses

Cost of Sales – Product Costs (in thousands)

“Cost of sales – product costs” represented 52% and 50% of consolidated
net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In absolute dollars, “cost of sales — product
costs” increased 9% from $734.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2006 to
$799.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2007. The primary factors affecting
the increase in “cost of sales – product costs” in absolute dollars and as a
percentage of consolidated net revenues were:

•

An increase in consolidated net
revenues of 3% from $1,468.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2006 to
$1,513.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2007.

•

A higher percentage of our business
relating to distribution which carries higher product costs than our publishing
business.

•

Higher net revenues from products for console
platforms in absolute dollars and as a percentage of publishing net revenues
from $812.3 million and 70% of publishing net revenues in fiscal 2006 to $886.8
million and 80% of publishing net revenues in fiscal 2007. Console products
have higher costs of sales – product costs associated with them than PC
products, due to the royalty payments to hardware manufacturers.

Partially offset by:

•

Non-recurring
write-downs of inventory costs recorded in fiscal 2006 in the amount of $14.5
million due to the high level of inventory for certain titles which, due to
weaker market conditions and a slow down in re-orders caused by the console
transition.

We
expect cost of sales — product costs as a percentage of net revenues to
decrease in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a larger
proportion of our business being derived from the publishing segment in fiscal
2008.

Cost of Sales

–

Software Royalties and Amortization (in thousands)

“Cost of sales – software royalties and amortization” for the year
ended March 31, 2007 decreased as a percentage of publishing net revenues from
the prior fiscal year, from 13% to 12%. In absolute dollars, “cost of sales


– software
royalties and amortization” for the year ended March 31, 2007 also decreased
from the prior fiscal year, from $147.8 million to $132.4 million. The
decreases were mainly due to:

•

A
decrease in the number of titles released in fiscal 2007 as compared to the
prior year when we had the largest slate of new releases in our history. A
decrease in amortization of software development costs from internally
developed games, was partially offset by increases in royalties for games
developed by third party developers.

•

Non-recurring
costs recorded in fiscal 2006 totaling $12.6 million, related to impairment
charges for a title in development in 2006, and recoverability write-offs
related to released titles.

We
expect “costs of sales – software royalties and amortization” to increase in
fiscal 2008 in proportion to the expected increase in publishing net revenues.

Cost of Sales – Intellectual Property
Licenses (in thousands)

“Cost of sales – intellectual property licenses” for the year ended
March 31, 2007 decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of publishing
net revenues over the same period last year, from $57.7 million to $46.1 million
and from 5% to 4%, respectively.

The decreases in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of publishing
net revenues were due mainly to a decrease in the number of titles with
associated intellectual property in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. In
fiscal 2007, we released the following titles with associated intellectual
property:

Marvel:
Ultimate Alliance, Over the Hedge, X-Men: Official Game, Guitar Hero 1 and 2,
Tony Hawk’s Project 8

and

Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam

.
In fiscal 2006, we released the
following titles with associated intellectual property:

Doom 3

for
the Xbox,

Madagascar, Fantastic Four, Ultimate Spider-Man,
X-Men Legends II, THAW, Quake IV,

and

Shrek
SuperSlam.

We
expect intellectual property licenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a
percentage of publishing net revenues in fiscal 2008 as a result of our planned
title slate which includes several key releases with licensed intellectual
property such as

Spider-Man: The Movie 3, Transformers, Shrek
the Third,

and

Bee Movie.

Product Development (in thousands)

Product development expenses of $133.1 million and $132.7 million
represented 12% and 11% of publishing net revenues for the years ended March
31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. T

he increases in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net
revenues was primarily generated by:

•

Increased costs incurred to fund more product
development capacity at certain studios as well as the addition of Red Octane.


•

Increases in
product development expenses of $4.8 million in fiscal 2007 related to
stock-based compensation expense as a result of the implementation of SFAS
123R.

•

Compensation
provided to employees in fiscal 2007 to cure tax penalties related to
previously-exercised stock options.

Partially offset by:

•

Product
cancellation charges of $11.4 million, including termination fees, incurred
during fiscal 2006. Given the market conditions, the lower than expected
performance of some of our third quarter fiscal 2006 releases, and risks
associated with console transition, we performed a thorough review of the then
pending product slate. To better align opportunities associated with the
next-generation console platforms with income potential and risks associated
with certain titles in development, we canceled development of certain titles
and permanently removed them from our future title slate. There were no product cancellation charges
during fiscal 2007.

•

The
implementation during fiscal 2007 of certain cost control initiatives including
sharing technologies and tools across multiple platforms and studios,
increasing our development schedules to facilitate a longer pre-production
phase and more predictable workflow times, and outsourcing certain areas of
game development to lower cost service providers.

Sales and Marketing (in thousands)

Sales and
marketing expenses of $196.2 million and $283.4 million represented 13% and 19%
of consolidated net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. T

he
decrease in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues was a result of the implementation of a more
targeted media program which worked more efficiently helped by the overall
strength and high quality of our fiscal 2007 title slate. We also released
fewer titles in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, where we had the largest
slate of new releases in our history. The decreases were partially offset by
expenses of $5.1 million in fiscal 2007 related to stock-based compensation
expense as a result of the implementation of SFAS 123R, as well as sales and
marketing expenses associated with the acquisition of the Guitar Hero
franchise.

General and Administrative (in thousands)

General and
administrative expenses of $132.5 million and $96.4 million represented 9% and
7% of consolidated net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The increases were primarily due to increased legal
expenses and professional fees relating primarily to our internal review of
historical stock option granting practices, the consolidation of RedOctane into
our results of operations, amortization of intangible assets related to the
RedOctane acquisition, and stock-based compensation expense of $10.0 million in
fiscal 2007 as a result of the implementation of SFAS 123R. These increases
were partially offset by the benefits of our cost optimization program launched
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and gains on foreign currency.


Operating Income

(in thousands)

Publishing
operating income for the year ended March 31, 2007 increased $70.8 million from
the same period last year, from an operating loss of $6.7 million to operating
income of $64.1 million. The increase is primarily due to:

•

The
strong performance of our fiscal 2007 titles.

•

A
decrease in provision for returns and price protection in fiscal 2007 from 18%
of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2006 compared to 9% of consolidated net
revenues in fiscal 2007, primarily due to improved market conditions and
stronger sell through of our 2007 title releases.

•

A
significant decrease in sales and marketing spending as a result of improved
efficiency in executing our marketing programs.

•

The
implementation of certain cost control initiatives resulting in decreased
product development and general and administrative expenses (excluding expenses
related to our internal review of historical stock option granting practices
and expenses relating to the informal SEC inquiry and derivative litigation).

•

Fiscal
2006 results included cancellation, impairment, and earn-out recoverability
charges totaling $24.0 million. See additional description of charges incurred
in the cost of sales – software royalties and amortization and the product
development discussions.

•

Fiscal
2006 results also included write-downs of inventory costs of $14.5 million. See
additional description in the cost of sales – product costs discussion.

Partially offset by:

•

Stock-based
compensation expenses of $22.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 as a
result of the implementation of SFAS 123R.

•

Legal
and other professional fees of $26.9 million associated with our internal
review of historical stock option granting practices, including expenses
relating to the informal SEC inquiry and derivative litigation.

•

Amortization of intangible assets related to
the RedOctane acquisition of $11.7 million.

Distribution operating income for the year ended March 31, 2007
decreased over the same period last year, from $21.9 million to $9.1 million. The
decrease in operating income in 2007 was primarily due to increased business
from large mass-market customers for which we earn smaller margins, an increase
in hardware sales which carries a lower margin than software, and higher
reserves for inventory obsolescence.


Investment Income, Net

(in thousands)

Investment
income, net for the year ended March 31, 2007 was $36.7 million as compared to
$30.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2006.

The increase was primarily due to higher
yields earned on our short term investments and cash equivalents, and a
realized gain in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 of $1.8 million on the sale
of an investment in common stock.

Provision for Income Taxes

(in thousands)

The income tax provision of $24.0 million for the year ended March 31,
2007 reflects our effective income tax rate of 22%. This is higher than prior
years as a result of an increase in pretax income for the year ended March 31,
2007, versus the amount of pretax income for the year ended March 31, 2006,
without a corresponding increase in the benefit of book/tax differences. The
significant items that generated the variance between our effective rate and
our statutory rate of 35% were research and development tax credits, the impact
of foreign tax rate differentials, and the elimination of the valuation
allowance for research and development tax credits, partially offset by state
taxes and the establishment of tax reserves for these credits and other
deferred tax assets. The realization of deferred tax assets depends primarily
on the generation of future taxable income. We believe that it is more likely
than not that we will generate taxable income sufficient to realize the benefit
of net deferred tax assets recognized.

Net Income

Net income for
the year ended March 31, 2007 was $85.8 million or $0.28 per diluted share, as
compared to $40.3 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the year ended March
31, 2006.

Results of Operations – Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2006 and 2005

Net Revenues

We primarily derive revenue from sales of
packaged interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles
(such as the PS2, Xbox, Xbox360, and GameCube), PCs, and hand-held game devices
(such as the GBA, NDS, and PSP). We also derive revenue from our distribution
business in Europe that provides logistical and sales services to third-party
publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations
and third-party manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.


The following table details our consolidated net revenues by business
segment and our publishing net revenues by territory for the years ended March
31, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands):

Consolidated
net revenues increased 4% from $1,405.9 million for the year ended March 31,
2005 to $1,468.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2006. This increase in
consolidated net revenues was solely generated by our publishing business and
was driven by the following:

•

An
increase year over year in the number of titles released. Our fiscal 2006
launch schedule included the largest slate of new releases in our history. In
fiscal 2006, we released seventeen major titles including the following major
releases:

Doom 3

for the Xbox,

Madagascar, Fantastic Four, Ultimate Spider-Man, X-Men Legends II,
THAW, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, GUN, True Crime: New York
City, Quake 4, Shrek SuperSlam, The Movies, Cabela’s Dangerous Hunts 2,

and

World Series of Poker.

In addition, four
of these titles,

Call of Duty 2, THAW, Quake 4,

and

GUN,

were released concurrently with the
release of the Xbox360 platform at a premium retail price of $59.99. This
compares to fourteen titles in fiscal 2005, which included the following major
releases:

Spider-Man 2, Call of Duty: Finest
Hour, Tony Hawk’s Underground 2 (“THUG 2”), Shrek 2, X-Men Legends, Doom 3,
Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events, Shark Tale, Cabela’s Big Game
Hunter 2005,

and

Rome: Total War.

Additionally in fiscal
2006, we achieved our goal of increasing the number of million and
multi-million unit selling titles.

•

An
increase in our hand-held platform presence growing publishing hand-held
revenues by $20.2 million or 15% from
$138.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2005 to $158.9 million for the year
ended March 31, 2006. This was driven by an increase in the number of hand-held
titles released combined with titles being released across more hand-held
platforms with the fiscal 2005 introductions of the PSP and NDS.

Partially offset by:

•

An
increase in provision for return and price protection throughout fiscal 2006
from 12% of net revenues in fiscal 2005 to 18% of net revenues in fiscal 2006,
due to challenging market conditions and the ongoing console transition.

•

A
decrease in net revenues from our distribution business due mostly to the
effect of year over year weakening of the Euro (“EUR”) and Great Britain Pound
(“GBP”) in relation to the United States Dollar (“USD”). Foreign exchange rates
decreased reported distribution net revenues by approximately $14.9 million for
the year ended March 31, 2006. Excluding the impact of changing foreign
currency rates, our distribution net revenues decreased 1% year over year.

North America Publishing Net Revenues (in
thousands)

North America publishing net revenues
increased 2% from $696.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2005 to $710.0
million for the year ended March 31, 2006. The increase reflects our largest
slate of releases in company history and expansion of our hand-held presence
with products for PSP, NDS, and GBA. This was offset by weaker market
conditions resulting in higher provisions for returns and price protection. North
America publishing net


revenues decreased as a percentage of consolidated net revenues from
50% for year ended March 31, 2005 to 48% for the year ended March 31, 2006. The
decrease is due to a larger increase in our international publishing net
revenues due to successful expansion efforts into new territories and the
strong performance of our affiliate titles in Europe.

International Publishing Net Revenues (in
thousands)

International
publishing net revenues increased by 18% from $376.4 million for the year ended
March 31, 2005 to $444.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2006.
Additionally, international publishing net revenues as a percentage of
consolidated net revenues increased from 27% for the year ended March 31, 2005
to 30% for the year ended March 31, 2006. The increases were due mainly to our
successful expansion efforts into new territories combined with strong performance
from our affiliate label products which included the successful LucasArts’
titles,

Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith

and

Star Wars Battlefront II.

The increase in international
publishing net revenues was partially offset by a weakening of the EUR and the
GBP in relation to the USD of approximately $14.5 million. Excluding the impact
of changing foreign currency rates, our international publishing net revenues
increased 22% year over year.

Publishing Net Revenues by Platform

Publishing net revenues increased 8% from
$1,072.7 million

for the year ended March 31, 2005

to
$1,154.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2006. The following table details
our publishing net revenues by platform and as a percentage of total publishing
net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands):

Personal Computer Net Revenues (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the PC
decreased 17% from $220.1 million and 21% of publishing net revenues for the
year ended March 31, 2005 to $183.5 million and 16% of publishing net revenues
for the year ended


March 31, 2006. The decrease in both absolute dollars and as a
percentage of publishing revenue was due to the slate of PC titles released in
fiscal 2005 in comparison to fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, we released the
highly successful PC titles

Doom 3

and

Rome: Total War

and also had
strong continued sell through of our catalog title,

Call of Duty.

Although
we had strong sales from our fiscal 2006 PC titles,

Call of Duty

2,

The Movies,

and

Quake 4,

in
fiscal 2005, according to NPD Funworld, we were the only publisher to have
three top-ten PC titles for calendar year 2004.

Sony PlayStation 2 Net Revenues (in
thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the PS2 increased 1% from $417.3
million for the year ended March 31, 2005 to $422.2 million for the year ended
March 31, 2006. The slight increase was primarily due to an increase in the
number of major titles released for the PS2 from seven major titles in fiscal
2005 to nine major titles in fiscal 2006. This increase was offset by an
increase in the provision for returns and price protection on new releases due
to weaker market conditions. In addition,

Madagascar,

which
was our fifth best selling PS2 title for fiscal 2006 in terms of units sold,
was released at a lower initial retail pricing point of $39.99 compared to
$49.99 for comparable children’s titles in fiscal 2005. As a percentage of
publishing net revenues, net revenues from sales of titles for the PS2
decreased from 39% for the year ended March 31, 2005 to 36% for the year ended
March 31, 2006. The decrease is due to a change in our platform revenue mix due
to the introduction of the Xbox360.

Microsoft Xbox Net Revenues (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the Xbox increased 5% from $196.9
million for the year ended March 31, 2005 to $205.9 million for the year ended
March 31, 2006 and held steady as a percentage of publishing net revenues at
18%. The increase was primarily attributable to the strong performance of our
first quarter fiscal 2006 Xbox exclusive release of

Doom 3

which
had no comparable Xbox exclusive title released in fiscal 2005

.

This increase was offset by increased provisions for
returns and price protection in anticipation of quicker required pricing
actions as a result of the introduction of the Xbox360, which is expected to
result in a gradual slowdown in sales for the Xbox as customers upgrade or
anticipate upgrading to the next-generation platform.

Microsoft Xbox360 Net Revenues (in thousands)

The Xbox360 was released in November 2005 and was the first of the
next-generation hardware to be released. Consistent with our goal of having a
significant presence at the launch of each new platform, we released four
titles concurrently with the release of the Xbox360,

Call of Duty
2, THAW, Quake 4,

and

GUN.

All of
these titles were released at premium retail pricing of $59.99. Although
limited by hardware availability in fiscal 2006, we experienced strong sales of
these four titles, and, according to NPD Funworld,

Call of Duty

was the number one title on the Xbox360 and had the highest attach
rate of any console launch in video game history.


Nintendo GameCube Net Revenues (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the
Nintendo GameCube decreased 16% from $96.9 million for the year ended March 31,
2005 to $81.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2006. Despite an increase in
the number of titles released for the GameCube from seven major titles for the
year ended March 31, 2005 to nine major titles for the year ended March 31,
2006, the releases in fiscal 2006, which included

GUN, Call of
Duty 2: Big Red One, THAW,

and

True Crime: New York City,

were less geared toward the demographics of the GameCube audience as
compared to our fiscal 2005 title releases, which included

Spider-Man 2

and

Shrek 2.

Additionally,

Madagascar,

which was our top selling title on the GameCube
in fiscal 2006,

was released at a lower initial
retail pricing of $39.99 as compared to

Spider-Man 2

and

Shrek 2

, which were both released at an
initial retail price of $49.99.

Madagascar

was
our top selling title on the GameCube for fiscal 2006 and although it performed
strongly, it compares to fiscal 2005 where our top two selling titles on the
GameCube were

Spider-Man 2

and

Shrek 2,

each of which outperformed

Madagascar.

Hand-held (in thousands)

Net revenues from sales of titles for the hand-held for the year ended
March 31, 2006 increased 15% from the prior fiscal year, from $138.7 million to
$158.9 million. Additionally, hand-held net revenues as a percentage of
publishing net revenues increased from 13% for the year ended March 31, 2005 to
14% for the year ended March 31, 2006. The increases were due to the worldwide
introductions of the NDS and PSP hand-held platforms in late fiscal 2005 and
the continued growth of their installed base throughout fiscal 2006, which
resulted in hand-held titles being sold across more platforms. In addition,
compared to the other hand-held platforms, titles for the PSP have a higher
retail pricing point of $49.99. The major titles driving hand-held net revenues
in fiscal 2006 were

Madagascar, Madagascar:
Operation Penguin, Fantastic Four, Ultimate Spider-Man,

and

Shrek SuperSlam

for the GBA;

Madagascar,
Ultimate Spider-Man, Tony Hawk’s American Sk8land,

and

Shrek SuperSlam

for the NDS; and

THUG 2,
Spider-Man 2, X-Men Legends II,

and LucasArts’

Star Wars
Battlefront II

for the PSP. This compares to fiscal 2005 where the
main titles driving hand-held net revenues were

Shrek 2,
Spider-Man 2,

and

DreamWorks’ Shark Tale

for
the GBA;

Spider-Man 2

for the NDS; and

THUG 2

and

Spider-Man 2

for
the PSP.

Distribution Net Revenues (in thousands)

Distribution
net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2006 decreased 6% from the prior
fiscal year, from $333.1 million to $313.3 million. Foreign exchange rates
decreased reported distribution net revenues by approximately $14.9 million for
the year ended March 31, 2006. Excluding the impact of the changing foreign
currency rates, our distribution net revenues decreased $4.9 million or 1% year
over year.

The
remaining year over year decrease was primarily due to the termination of
relationships with unprofitable publishers and stronger third-party releases in
fiscal 2005.

The mix of
distribution net revenues between hardware and software sales varied year over
year with approximately 20% of distribution net revenues from hardware sales in
the year ended March 31, 2006 as compared to 13% in the prior fiscal year. This
was mainly attributed to the release of the PSP in Europe in the second quarter
of


fiscal 2006 and the release of the Xbox360 in November 2005. In both
fiscal years, hardware sales were principally comprised of sales of console
hardware.

Costs and Expenses

Cost of Sales – Product Costs (in thousands)

Cost of sales – product costs represented 50% and 47% of consolidated
net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In absolute dollars, cost of sales – product
costs increased 12% from $658.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2005 to
$734.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2006. The primary factors affecting
the increase in cost of sales – product costs in absolute dollars and as a percentage
of consolidated net revenues were:

•

Volume
growth in our European territories of LucasArts’

Star Wars:
Episode III Revenge of the Sith,

and

Star Wars
Battlefront II.

LucasArts’ titles are part of our affiliate label
program and carry a significantly higher product cost than Activision developed
titles.

•

Write-downs
of inventory costs for certain titles in fiscal 2006 in the amount of $14.5
million due to the high level of inventory for certain titles at the end of our
third quarter of fiscal 2006. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 we
reviewed the levels of inventory and determined that, due to lower than
expected re-orders caused by weaker market conditions and the ongoing console
transition, we anticipated that certain titles in our inventory would likely be
sold below its original cost.

•

A
decrease in our PC net revenues as a percentage of publishing net revenues from
21% in fiscal 2005 to 16% in fiscal 2006. Products for PC typically have lower
costs of sales – product costs associated with them as they do not require
royalty payments to hardware manufacturers.

•

An
increase in provision for returns and price protection throughout fiscal 2006
from 12% of net revenues in fiscal 2005 compared to 18% of net revenues in
fiscal 2006, due to challenging market conditions and the ongoing console
transition.

•

An increase in consolidated net
revenues of 4% from $1,405.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2005 to
$1,468.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2006.

•

Reduced
pricing on a number of catalog titles as well as new releases in our kids
genre.

Cost of Sales –

Software Royalties and Amortization (in thousands)

Cost of sales – software royalties and amortization for the year ended
March 31, 2006 increased as a percentage of publishing net revenues from the
prior fiscal year, from 12% to 13%. In absolute dollars, cost of sales –
software royalties and amortization for the year ended March 31, 2006 also
increased from the prior fiscal year, from $123.8 million to $147.8 million. The
increases in cost of sales – software royalties and amortization in both
absolute dollars and as a percentage of publishing net revenues were mainly due
to:

•

Impairment
charges and recoverability write-offs of $12.6 million in fiscal 2006. We
performed a detailed review of capitalized costs for released titles and
determined that expected future revenues, given the change


in market
conditions, on certain titles would not support the remaining capitalized
software balance on these titles. As a result, we incurred a $3.8 million
recoverability charge on these titles in fiscal 2006. In addition, we reviewed
future recoverability of capitalized amounts on titles in development and
determined that one of our titles, to be released in fiscal 2007, was unlikely
to fully recover capitalized costs given the change in expectations as a result
of weaker market conditions and uncertainty involved in the console transition
and, as a result, took an impairment charge of $8.8 million on this title.

•

Overall
continued increases in costs to develop titles for additional platforms,
particularly those titles released for the more technologically advanced
next-generation console platforms.

Cost of Sales – Intellectual Property
Licenses (in thousands)

Cost of sales – intellectual property licenses for the year ended March
31, 2006 decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of publishing net
revenues over the same period last year, from $62.2 million to $57.7 and from
6% to 5%, respectively.

The decreases in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of publishing
net revenues were due mainly to a one-time benefit related to the settlement of
an intellectual property claim in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The number
of titles with associated intellectual property remained relatively flat year
over year. In fiscal 2006, we released the following titles with associated
intellectual property:

Doom 3

for the
Xbox,

Madagascar, Fantastic Four, Ultimate Spider-Man,
X-Men Legends II, THAW, Quake IV,

and

Shrek
SuperSlam.

In fiscal 2005 we released the following titles with
associated intellectual property:

Spider-Man
2, Shrek 2, Shark Tale, X-Men Legends, THUG 2, Lemony Snicket’s A Series
of Unfortunate Events,

and

Doom 3.

Product Development (in thousands)

Product development expenses for the year ended March 31, 2006
increased as a percentage of publishing net revenues from the prior fiscal
year, from 8% to 11%. In absolute dollars, product development expenses for the
year ended March 31, 2006 also increased from the prior fiscal year, from $87.8
million to $132.7 million. The increase in product development expenses both in
absolute dollars and as a percentage of publishing net revenues was due to:

•

Increased development, quality assurance, and
outside developer costs as a result of the development of more technologically
advanced titles across more platforms.

•

Product
cancellation charges of $11.4 million, including termination fees, incurred
during fiscal 2006. Given the market conditions, the lower than expected
performance of some of our third quarter fiscal 2006 releases, and risks
associated with console transition, we performed a thorough review of our
upcoming product slate. To better align opportunities associated with the
next-generation console platforms with income potential and risks associated
with certain titles in development, we canceled development of certain titles
and permanently removed them from our future title slate.

•

Increased costs in fiscal 2006 related to the
full year operation of three recently acquired studios, Vicarious Visions,
Inc., Toys for Bob, Inc., and Beenox, Inc., as well as costs incurred to fund
more product development capacity at certain studios.


Sales and Marketing (in thousands)

Sales and marketing expenses of $283.4 million and $230.3 million
represented 19% and 16% of consolidated net revenues for the years ended March
31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. T

he increases in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net
revenues was primarily generated by our publishing business as a result of
significant marketing programs including television and in-theatre ad campaigns
and in-store promotions to support our biggest product release slate in company
history. The increase in sales and marketing investment as a percentage of net
revenues was a result of additional sales and marketing investment during the
key holiday season which did not provide the revenue increase that was
anticipated at the time that the marketing costs were incurred.

General and Administrative (in thousands)

General and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2006
increased $33.1 million over the same period last year, from $63.2 million to
$96.4 million.  As a percentage of consolidated net revenues, general and
administrative expenses increased from 4% to 7%. The increases were primarily
due to an increase in personnel costs including costs related to European
territory expansion, separation and severance costs associated with a less than
7% reduction in workforce in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, increased
bad debt write-offs, an increase in foreign currency transaction losses,
and increased legal costs.

Operating Income

(in thousands)

Publishing
operating income for the year ended March 31, 2006 decreased $162.6 million
from the same period last year, from $155.9 million to an operating loss of
$6.7 million. The decrease is primarily due to:

•

Increased
sales and marketing spending to support our large title release slate.

•

An
increase in provision for returns and price protection throughout fiscal 2006
from 12% of net revenues in fiscal 2005 compared to 18% of net revenues in
fiscal 2006, due to challenging market conditions and the ongoing console
transition.

•

Cancellation,
impairment, and earn-out recoverability charges totaling $24.0 million taken in
fiscal 2006. See additional description of charges incurred in the cost of
sales – software royalties and amortization and the product development
discussions.


•

Write-downs
of inventory costs of $14.5 million taken during fiscal 2006. See additional
description in the cost of sales – product costs discussion.

Distribution operating income for the year ended March 31, 2006
decreased over the same period last year, from $23.7 million to $21.9 million. The
decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency rates
on distribution operating income of approximately $1.4 million. Excluding the
impact of changes in foreign currency rates, distribution operating income for
the year ended March 31, 2006 decreased approximately $0.4 million or 2% from
the same period last year.

Investment Income, Net

(in thousands)

Investment
income, net for the year ended March 31, 2006 was $30.6 million as compared to
$13.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2005.

The increase was primarily due to higher
invested balances combined with rising yields, a realized gain in the first
quarter of fiscal 2006 of $1.3 million on the sale of an investment in common
stock, and a realized gain of $2.9 million on the sale of a cost basis
investment during the year ended March 31, 2006 as compared to 2005.

Provision for Income Taxes

(in thousands)

The income tax provision of $5.6 million for the year ended March 31,
2006 reflects our effective income tax rate of 12%, which differs from our
effective rate of 30% for the year ended March 31, 2005, due to an increase in
federal research and development credit for the year ended March 31, 2006, over
the amount generated for the year ended March 31, 2005, and a decrease in
pretax income for the year ended March 31, 2006, versus the amount of pretax
income for the year ended March 31, 2005, without a corresponding decrease in
the benefit of book/tax. The significant items that generated the variance
between our effective rate and our statutory rate of 35% were research and
development tax credits and the impact of foreign tax rate differentials,
partially offset by an increase in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance
and state taxes. The realization of deferred tax assets depends primarily on
the generation of future taxable income. We believe that it is more likely than
not that we will generate taxable income sufficient to realize the benefit of
net deferred tax assets recognized.

Net Income

Net income for
the year ended March 31, 2006 was $40.3 million or $0.14 per diluted share, as
compared to $135.1 million or $0.49 per diluted share for the year ended March
31, 2005.


Selected
Quarterly Operating Results

Our quarterly
operating results have in the past varied significantly and will likely vary
significantly in the future, depending on numerous factors, several of which
are not under our control. See Item 1A - “Risk Factors.”  Our business also has experienced and is
expected to continue to experience significant seasonality, largely due to
consumer buying patterns and our product release schedule focusing on those
patterns. Net revenues typically are significantly higher during the fourth
calendar quarter, primarily due to the increased demand for consumer software
during the year-end holiday buying season. Accordingly, we believe that period to
period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and
should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.

The following
table is a comparative breakdown of our unaudited quarterly results for the
immediately preceding eight quarters (amounts in thousands, except per share
data):

(1)

Consolidated
financial information has been restated for the effect of our four-for-three
stock split effected in the form of a 33-1/3% stock dividend to shareholders of
record as of October 10, 2005, paid October 24, 2005.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources of Liquidity

As of March 31, 2007, our primary source of liquidity is comprised of
$384.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $570.4 million of short-term
investments. Over the last two years, our primary sources of liquidity have
included cash on hand at the beginning of the year and cash flows generated
from continuing operations. We have also generated cash flows from the issuance
of our common stock to employees through the exercise of options, which is
described in more detail below in “Cash Flows from Financing Activities.”  We have not utilized debt financing as a
significant source of cash flows. However, we do have available at certain of
our international locations, credit facilities, which are described below in “Credit
Facilities,” that can be utilized if needed.

We believe that we have sufficient working capital ($1,060.1 million at
March 31, 2007), as well as proceeds available from our international credit
facilities, to finance our operational requirements for at least the next
twelve months, including purchases of inventory and equipment, the funding of
the development, production, marketing and sale of new products, and the
acquisition of intellectual property rights for future products from third
parties.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

The primary source of cash flows from operating activities typically
have included the collection of customer receivables generated by the sale of
our products, offset by payments to vendors for the manufacture, distribution,
and marketing of our products, third-party developers and intellectual property
holders, and our own employees. A significant operating use of our cash relates
to our continued investment in software development and intellectual property
licenses. We spent approximately $166.1 million and $193.9 million in the years
ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, in connection with the acquisition
of publishing or distribution rights for products being developed by third
parties, the execution of new license agreements granting us long-term rights
to intellectual property of third parties, as well as the capitalization of
product development costs relating to internally developed products. The
decrease period over period is primarily due to new agreements with DreamWorks
Animation LLC, Marvel Characters which were signed in fiscal 2006, partially
offset by increased product development costs related to titles in development
and additional intellectual property licenses in fiscal 2007.

We expect
that we will continue to make significant expenditures relating to our
investment in software development and intellectual property licenses. Our
future cash commitments relating to these investments are detailed below in “Commitments.”  Cash flows from operations are affected by
our ability to release highly successful or “hit” titles. Though many of these
titles have substantial production or acquisition costs and marketing
expenditures, once a title recoups these costs, incremental net revenues
typically will directly and positively impact cash flows.

For the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, cash flows from operating
activities were $27.2 million and $86.0 million, respectively. The principal
components comprising cash flows from operating activities for the year ended
March 31, 2007, included

favorable operating results,
amortization of capitalized software development costs and intellectual
property licenses, increases in payables and accrued liabilities, partially
offset by investments in software development and intellectual property
licenses and increases in accounts receivables. See an analysis of the


change in key
balance sheet accounts below in “Key Balance Sheet Accounts.”  We expect that a primary source of future
liquidity, both short-term and long-term, will be the result of cash flows from
continuing operations.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

The primary source of cash used in investing activities typically have
included capital expenditures, acquisitions of privately held interactive
software development companies and publishing companies, and the net effect of
purchases and sales/maturities of short-term investment vehicles. The goal of
our short-term investments is to maximize return while minimizing risk,
maintaining liquidity, coordinating with anticipated working capital needs, and
providing for prudent investment diversification.

For the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, cash flows used in
investing activities were $35.2 million and $85.8 million, respectively. For
the year ended March 31, 2007, cash flows used in investing activities were
primarily the result of cash paid for business acquisitions and capital
expenditures, purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by proceeds
from sales and maturities of short-term investments. The decrease in cash flows
used in investing activities versus the prior year was primarily related to our
short term investment activity as we had net proceeds from maturities in fiscal
2007 versus net purchases of short term investments in fiscal 2006. We have
historically financed our acquisitions through the issuance of shares of common
stock or a combination of common stock and cash. We will continue to evaluate
potential acquisition candidates as to the benefit they bring to us.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

The primary source of cash provided by financing activities has been
transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of
common stock to employees. We have not utilized debt financing as a significant
source of cash flows. However, we do have available at certain of our
international locations, credit facilities, which are described below in “Credit
Facilities,” that can be utilized if needed.

For the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, cash flows from financing
activities were $28.0 million and $45.1 million, respectively. The cash
provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2007 was the
result of the

issuance of common stock related to employee stock option and stock purchase
plans. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities from the prior
year is due to the suspension of stock option exercises as of November 9, 2006
due to our internal review of historical stock option granting practices.

During fiscal 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a buyback program
under which we can repurchase up to $350.0 million of our common stock. Under
the program, shares may be purchased as determined by management and within
certain guidelines, from time to time, in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions, including privately negotiated structured stock
repurchase transactions and through transactions in the options markets.
Depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be
commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice. As
of March 31, 2007, we had approximately $226.2 million available for
utilization under the buyback program. We actively manage our capital structure
as a component of our overall business strategy. Accordingly, in the future,
when we determine that market conditions are appropriate, we may seek to
achieve long term value for the shareholders through, among other things, new
debt or equity financings or refinancings, share repurchases, and other
transactions involving our equity or debt securities.


Key Balance Sheet Accounts

Accounts Receivable

The increase in gross accounts receivable was
primarily the result of higher fourth quarter revenues due to:

•

The fourth quarter fiscal 2007 European
release of the PS3 hardware.

•

Late fourth quarter fiscal 2007 European
releases of

Call of Duty

3, Tony
Hawk’s Project 8

, and

Marvel:
Ultimate Alliance

for the PS3. There were no corresponding new
releases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.

•

Continued strong catalogue performance of
our 2006 holiday slate.

Reserves for returns, price protection and
bad debt decreased from $98.3 million at March 31, 2006 to $91.4 million at
March 31, 2007 while reserves as a percentage of gross receivables decreased
from 77% to 38%. This decrease

was largely due to significant
reserves for returns and price protection required at March 31, 2006 related to
weak market conditions and the uncertainty involved in the ongoing console
transition. Reserves for returns and price protection are a function of the
number of units and pricing of titles in retail inventory (see description of
Allowances for Returns, Price Protection, Doubtful Accounts, and Inventory
Obsolescence in Item 7: Critical Accounting Policies).

Inventories

The increase in inventories at March 31, 2007 compared to March 31,
2006 is the result of additional inventories associated with RedOctane and the
Guitar Hero products, which was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2007,
additional PS3 inventory due to the European release of the console late in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, and an increase in inventories at our
distribution business related to the addition of a significant new customer in the
second quarter of fiscal 2007.

Software Development

Software development
increased from $60.6 million at March 31, 2006 to $130.9 million at March 31,
2007 due to c

ontinued investment in software development for titles
being developed for release in fiscal 2008, particularly for three significant
new games slated for release in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, offset by
amortization of software development costs for titles launched in fiscal 2007.


Intellectual Property Licenses

Intellectual property
licenses increased from $87.0 million at March 31, 2006 to $100.3 million at
March 31, 2007. The increase in

intellectual
property licenses

was
primarily the result of:

•

Continued
investment in intellectual property licenses totaling $23.2 million in fiscal 2007 for license agreements
granting us long-term rights to intellectual property of third parties, such as
our agreement with MGM Interactive and EON Productions Ltd. to develop and
publish interactive entertainment games based on the James Bond license.

Partially offset by:

•

$10.0 million of amortization of
intellectual property licenses mostly related to releases in the first quarter
of fiscal 2007.

Accounts
Payable

The increase in accounts
payable of $47.5 million from March 31, 2006 to March 31, 2007 primarily
reflects amounts due to support the significant launch slate in the first
quarter of fiscal 2008 versus no similar launches in the same quarter of fiscal
2007.

Accrued
Expenses

The increase
in accrued expenses was primarily driven by:

•

Tax
reserves recorded in fiscal 2007 as a result of improved profitability leading
to utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.

•

Increased
annual bonuses as a result of company performance.

•

Increased
royalties payable due to higher percentage of products being developed
externally.

Credit Facilities

We have revolving credit facilities with our Centresoft subsidiary
located in the UK (the “UK Facility”) and our NBG subsidiary located in Germany
(the “German Facility”). The UK Facility provided Centresoft with the ability
to borrow up to GBP 12.0 million ($23.6 million), including issuing letters of
credit, on a revolving basis as of March 31, 2007. Furthermore, under the UK
Facility, Centresoft provided a GBP 0.6 million ($1.2 million) guarantee for
the benefit of our CD Contact subsidiary as of March 31, 2006. The UK Facility
bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.0% as of March 31, 2007, is collateralized by
substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and expires in January 2008.


The UK
Facility also contains various covenants that require the subsidiary to
maintain specified financial ratios related to, among others, fixed charges. As
of March 31, 2006, we were in compliance with these covenants. No borrowings
were outstanding against the UK Facility as of March 31, 2006. The German
Facility provided for revolving loans up to EUR 0.5 million ($0.7 million) as
of March 31, 2007, bore interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus 2.5%, is
collateralized by certain of the subsidiary’s property and equipment and has no
expiration date. No borrowings were outstanding against the German Facility as
of March 31, 2007.

As of March 31, 2007, we maintained a $7.5 million irrevocable standby
letter of credit. The standby letter of credit is required by one of our
inventory manufacturers to qualify for payment terms on our inventory purchases.
Under the terms of this arrangement, we are required to maintain on deposit
with the bank a compensating balance, restricted as to use, of not less than
the sum of the available amount of the letter of credit plus the aggregate
amount of any drawings under the letter of credit that have been honored
thereunder but not reimbursed. At March 31, 2007, the $7.5 million deposit is
included in short-term investments as restricted cash. No borrowings were outstanding
as of March 31, 2007 or 2006.

As of March 31, 2007, our publishing subsidiary located in the UK
maintained a EUR 4.0 million ($5.3 million) irrevocable standby letter of
credit. The standby letter of credit is required by one of our inventory manufacturers
to qualify for payment terms on our inventory purchases. The standby letter of
credit does not require a compensating balance and is collateralized by
substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and expires in August 2007. No
borrowings were outstanding as of March 31, 2007 or 2006.

Commitments

In the
normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third
parties for non-cancelable operating lease agreements for our offices, for the
development of products, as well as for the rights to intellectual property. Under
these agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor,
developer, or intellectual property holder, based upon contractual arrangements.
Typically, the payments to third-party developers are conditioned upon the
achievement by the developers of contractually specified development milestones.
These payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders
typically are deemed to be advances and are recoupable against future royalties
earned by the developer or intellectual property holder based on the sale of
the related game. Additionally, in

connection with certain intellectual
property right acquisitions and development agreements, we will commit to spend
specified amounts for marketing support for the related game(s) which is to be
developed or in which the intellectual property will be utilized. Additionally,
we lease certain of our facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating
lease agreements. Assuming all contractual provisions are met, the total future
minimum commitments for these and other contractual arrangements in place as of
March 31, 2007, are scheduled to be paid as follows (amounts in thousands):


As of
March 31, 2007 and 2006, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated
entities or financial parties, such as entities often referred to as structured
finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the
purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually
narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing,
liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such
relationships.

Related Parties

From
August 2001 until September 2005, one of the members of our Board of Directors
was an individual who is a partner in a law firm that has provided legal
services to Activision for more than ten years. For the years ended March 31,
2005 and 2004, the years presented in this Annual Report for which that person
was a member of the Board of Directors, the fees we paid to the law firm were
an insignificant portion of the law firm’s total revenues. We believe that the
fees charged to us by the law firm were competitive with the fees charged by
other law firms.

Financial Disclosure

We
maintain internal controls over financial reporting, which generally include
those controls relating to the preparation of our financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. We also are focused on our “disclosure controls and procedures,”
which as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission are generally those
controls and procedures designed to ensure that financial and non-financial
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission is reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information
is communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officers and our
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

Our Disclosure
Committee, which operates under the Board approved Disclosure Committee Charter
and Disclosure Controls & Procedures Policy, includes senior management
representatives and assists executive management in its oversight of the
accuracy and timeliness of our disclosures, as well as in implementing and
evaluating our overall disclosure process. As part of our disclosure process,
senior finance and operational representatives from all of our corporate
divisions and business units prepare quarterly reports regarding their current
quarter operational performance, future trends, subsequent events, internal
controls, changes in internal controls, and other accounting and
disclosure-relevant information. These quarterly reports are reviewed by
certain key corporate finance representatives. These corporate finance
representatives also conduct quarterly interviews on a rotating basis with the
preparers of selected quarterly reports. The results of the quarterly reports
and related interviews are reviewed by the Disclosure Committee. Finance
representatives also conduct reviews with our senior management team, our
internal and external counsel, and other appropriate personnel involved in the
disclosure process, as appropriate. Additionally, senior finance and
operational representatives provide internal certifications regarding the
accuracy of information they provide that is utilized in the preparation of our
periodic public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Financial
results and other financial information also are reviewed with the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. As required by
applicable regulatory requirements, the Chief Executive Officers and the Chief
Financial Officer review and make various certifications regarding the accuracy
of our periodic public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control
over financial reporting. With the assistance of the Disclosure Committee, we
will continue to assess and monitor our disclosure controls and procedures, and
our internal controls over financial reporting, and will make refinements as
necessary.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards and Laws

In February 2006, the FASB
issued Statement No. 155 (“SFAS No. 155”),

Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Financial Instruments – An amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140.

SFAS No. 155 amends FASB Statements No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,

and No. 140,

Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities

to resolve
issues addressed in Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, “Application of
Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets.” SFAS
No. 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument
that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation;
clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject
to the requirements of Statement 133; establishes a requirement to evaluate
interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are
freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain
an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation; clarifies that concentrations of
credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives; and
amends Statement 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying


special purpose entity from
holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial
interest other than another derivative financial instrument. SFAS No. 155 is
effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning
of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We do
not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 155 will have a material effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

In
March 2006,

the FASB
issued Statement No. 156 (“SFAS No. 156”),

Accounting for Servicing
of Financial Assets – an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140.

SFAS
No. 156 amends Statement No. 140,

Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities,

with respect to the accounting for separately
recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. SFAS No. 156 requires an
entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it
undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a
servicing contract in certain situations; requires all separately recognized
servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair
value, if practicable; permits either the “amortization method”

or the “fair value measurement method,”

as
subsequent measurement methods for each class of separately recognized
servicing assets and servicing liabilities; permits a one-time reclassification
of available-for-sale securities to trading securities by entities with
recognized servicing rights; and requires separate presentation of servicing
assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value in the
statement of financial position and additional disclosures for all separately
recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is
effective in the first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We do
not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 156 will have a material effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

In
July 2006, the FASB issued Final Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”),

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

,
an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income
taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is
required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48
also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest,
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. In
addition, FIN 48 excludes income taxes from the scope of SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

.  FIN 48
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006.
 Differences between the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance
sheets prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption
will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the
beginning balance of retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the effect
that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our results of operations and
financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB
issued Statement No. 157 (“SFAS No. 157”),

Fair Value Measurements.

SFAS
No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair
value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements
that require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new
fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 157
will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In September 2006,
the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 108,

Financial Statements — Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
Financial Statements

(“SAB
108”). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects
of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered
in quantifying a current year misstatement

.

SAB 108 requires the use of both the “iron
curtain” and “rollover” approach in quantifying the materiality of
misstatements. SAB 108 also discusses the implications of misstatements
uncovered upon the application of SAB 108 in situations when a registrant has
historically been using either the iron curtain approach or the rollover
approach. SAB 108 is effective for
fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB
108 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
132(R)

(“SFAS No. 158”). This new standard aims to make it easier
for investors, employees, retirees and other parties to understand and assess
an employer’s financial position and its ability to fulfill the obligations
under its benefit plans. SFAS No. 158 requires employers to fully recognize in
their financial statements the obligations associated with single-employer
defined benefit pension plans, retiree healthcare plans, and other
postretirement plans. Specifically, it requires a company to (1) recognize on
its balance sheet an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a
plan’s underfunded status, (2) measure a plan’s assets and its obligations that
determine its funded status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year, and
(3) recognize changes in the funded status of a plan through comprehensive
income in the year in which the changes occur.

The adoption of SFAS No.
158 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations.


In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 115

(“SFAS No. 159”).
SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently
required to be measured at fair value. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses
on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in
earnings. The provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We
are evaluating if we will adopt SFAS No. 159 and what impact the
adoption will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements if we adopt.

Inflation

Our management
currently believes that inflation has not had a material impact on continuing
operations.


Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is
the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our
market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates, and market prices. Our market risk sensitive
instruments are classified as instruments entered into for purposes “other than
trading.”  Our views on market risk are
not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not
represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur, since actual
gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, market prices,
and the timing of transactions.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to our investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial
instruments in our investment portfolio. We manage our interest rate risk by
maintaining an investment portfolio consisting primarily of debt instruments
with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities. We also
manage our interest rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash
equivalent balances such that we are typically able to hold our investments to
maturity. As of March 31, 2007, our cash equivalents and short-term investments
included debt securities of $652.8 million.

The following table presents the amounts and related weighted average
interest rates of our investment portfolio as of March 31, 2007 (amounts in
thousands):

Our short-term
investments generally mature between three months and thirty months.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We transact
business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial
market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
particularly EUR, GBP, and AUD. The volatility of EUR, GBP, and AUD (and all
other applicable currencies) will be monitored frequently throughout the coming
year. When appropriate, we enter into hedging transactions in order to mitigate
our risk from foreign currency fluctuations. We will continue to use hedging
programs in the future and may use currency forward contracts, currency
options, and/or other derivative financial instruments commonly utilized to
reduce financial market risks if it is determined that such hedging activities
are appropriate to reduce risk. We do not hold or purchase any foreign currency
contracts for trading purposes. As of March 31, 2007, accrued expenses
included approximately $90,000 of pre-tax unrealized losses for the estimated fair
value of outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts, which was
recorded in earnings as the contracts did not qualify as hedging instruments.
As of March 31, 2006, we had no outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts.

Market Price Risk

With regard to the structured stock repurchase transactions described
in Note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at those
times when we have structured stock repurchase transactions outstanding, it is
possible that at settlement we could take delivery of shares at an effective
repurchase price higher than the then market price. As of March 31, 2007, we
had no structured stock repurchase transactions outstanding.


Item 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

All other
schedules of Activision are omitted because of the absence of conditions under
which they are required or because the required information is included
elsewhere in the financial statements or in the notes thereto.

Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH
ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES

None.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

1) Definition and Limitations of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures.

Our disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to reasonably assure that: (i)
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules
and forms and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. A control
system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the
Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in
our periodic reports. Inherent limitations to any system of disclosure controls
and procedures include, but are not limited to, the possibility of human error
and the circumvention or overriding of such controls by one or more persons. In
addition, we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions,
which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, and our
system of controls may therefore not achieve its desired objectives under all
possible future events.

2)  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures.

Our
management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officers and Chief
Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of March 31, 2007. Based on this controls evaluation, and
subject to the limitations described above, the Chief Executive Officers and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by
this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis.


3)  Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Our management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officers and Chief
Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of March
31, 2007, of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework. Based on
this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2007.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Our assessment
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
March 31, 2007 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included in this
annual report on Form 10-K.

4)
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as
such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the last quarter of this period covered by this report that have
materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting related to the remediation of the previously
identified material weakness as discussed below within the Remediation of the
Material Weakness.

5)
Remediation of the Material Weakness.

During the quarter ended
March 31, 2007, we made the following changes that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

New policies and procedures
for our stock option grant practices were approved on November 21, 2006 by the
Joint Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board, and
became effective January 1, 2007. Our new option granting policies and
procedures are designed to ensure internal control surrounding the pricing and
modification of option grants is adequate, and also provide the Compensation
Committee with the full ability to review and approve all grants prior to
pricing on a date set on or after the date of the Compensation Committee action.
Some of the highlights of the new option granting process are:

•

All
proposed grants during the month are verified so as to comply with pre-approved
grant guidelines and other financial and legal requirements by the seventh day
of the following month. For these purposes, a team of legal, human resources
and finance personnel (“Cross Functional Team”) has been established to review
each proposed grant for compliance with documentation and procedures. No grant is
issued until such compliance is established and the grant is approved by the
Compensation Committee.

•

The
Compensation Committee meets at least quarterly, to review and approve all
documented and verified proposed grants submitted by the Cross Functional Team.
All grants approved by the Compensation Committee are effective, and priced
based on the closing price of our stock, on a date set by the Compensation
Committee that is on or after the date of Compensation Committee action. Details
of the grant (including the exercise price) are communicated to the grantees
promptly following approval and pricing.

•

All
new hire offer letters and employee renewal agreements provide that all grants
and terms of grants are subject to approval by the Compensation Committee.

•

Stock
option data is entered into Equity Edge, our stock option tracking software,
promptly (and only) after grant approval is received from the Compensation
Committee.


In addition,
we have realigned certain internal responsibilities related to the granting and
reporting of stock options. In this regard, the employment contract of
our former head of human resources, which expired on March 31, 2007, was not
renewed;

a new head of human resources

is being recruited and, in the interim, responsibilities for stock
option granting and reporting have been reassigned. To further enhance our corporate
governance practices, we have established and filled a position of principal
compliance officer, with a reporting line directly to the Nominating and
Governance Committee, and are reviewing the configuration of the Compensation
Committee of the Board.

In addition,
consistent with the recommendations of the Special Subcommittee, we have
disengaged from our prior outside corporate counsel and have engaged new

outside corporate counsel.

Finally, Board
meetings include more senior executives and human resources, finance and legal
personnel have received additional training on options and compliance issues.

Management
evaluated the design and operation of these new controls and concluded that
these controls were in place, designed and operating effectively as of March
31, 2007. Management has concluded that the additional controls described above
have remediated our previously disclosed material weakness in our internal
control over financial reporting.

Pursuant

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Activision, Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits of Activision, Inc.’s consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
March 31, 2007, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits,
are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 8, present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Activision, Inc. and its subsidiaries at March 31,
2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2007 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction
with the related consolidated

financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule

based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of
financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the
Company changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation in
fiscal 2007.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A,
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of March 31, 2007 based on criteria established in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over
financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable

F-1

assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Business

Activision,
Inc. (“Activision,” the “Company,” or “we”) is a leading international
publisher of interactive entertainment software and peripheral products. We
have built a company with a diverse portfolio of products that spans a wide
range of categories and target markets and that is used on a variety of game
hardware platforms and operating systems. We have created, licensed, and
acquired a group of highly recognizable brands, which we market to a variety of
consumer demographics. Our products cover diverse game categories including
action/adventure, action sports, racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person
action, music-based gaming and strategy. Our target customer base ranges from
casual players to game enthusiasts, children to adults, and mass-market
consumers to “value” buyers. We currently offer our products primarily in
versions that operate on the Sony PlayStation 2 (“PS2”), Sony PlayStation 3 (“PS3”),
Nintendo Wii (“Wii”), and Microsoft Xbox 360 (“Xbox360”) console systems,
Nintendo Game Boy Advance (“GBA”), Sony PlayStation Portable (“PSP”), and
Nintendo Dual Screen (“NDS”) hand-held devices, and the personal computer (“PC”).
In prior years, we have also offered our products on the Sony PlayStation (“PS1”),
Microsoft Xbox (“Xbox”), Nintendo GameCube (“NGC”), and Nintendo 64 (“N64”)
console systems, and the Nintendo Game Boy Color (“GBC”) hand-held device.

Our publishing
business involves the development, marketing, and sale of products directly, by
license, or through our affiliate label program with certain third-party
publishers. Our distribution business consists of operations in Europe that
provide logistical and sales services to third-party publishers of interactive
entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of
interactive entertainment hardware.

We maintain
operations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom (“UK”), Germany,
France, Italy, Spain, Japan, Australia, Sweden, South Korea, and the
Netherlands. In fiscal year 2007, international operations contributed
approximately 50% of consolidated net revenues.

Principles of
Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Activision, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash, Cash
Equivalents, and Short-term Investments

Cash and cash equivalents include cash, money
markets, and short-term investments with original maturities of not more than
90 days.

Short-term
investments generally mature between three and thirty months. Investments with
maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their
liquid nature and because such securities represent the investment of cash that
is available for current operations. All of our short-term investments are
classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair market value with
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) reported as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity. The specific
identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed with
realized gains and losses reflected in investment income, net.

Restricted Cash – Compensating Balances

As of March
31, 2007 and 2006, we maintained a $7.5 million irrevocable standby letter of
credit. The standby letter of credit is required by one of our inventory
manufacturers to qualify for payment terms on our inventory purchases. Under
the terms of this arrangement, we are required to maintain on deposit with the
bank a compensating balance, restricted as to use, of not less than the sum of
the available amount of the letter of credit plus the aggregate amount of any
drawings under the letter of credit that have been honored thereunder but not
reimbursed. At March 31, 2007 and 2006,
the $7.5 million deposit is included in short-term investments as restricted
cash.

F-7

Concentration of
Credit Risk

Financial
instruments which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk
consist principally of temporary cash investments and accounts receivable. We
place our temporary cash investments with financial institutions. At various
times during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, we had
deposits in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limit
at these financial institutions.

Our customer
base includes retail outlets and distributors, including mass-market retailers,
consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game specialty stores in
the United States and countries worldwide. We perform ongoing credit
evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit
losses. We generally do not require collateral or other security from our
customers.

We had
two customers, Wal-Mart and GameStop, that accounted for 22% and 8% of
consolidated net revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 and 26% and 6%
of consolidated gross accounts receivable at March 31, 2007. These customers
were customers of both our publishing and distribution businesses. We had two
customers, Wal-Mart and Gamestop, that accounted for 22% and 10% of
consolidated net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2006 and 43% and 4% of
consolidated gross accounts receivable at March 31, 2006. For the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2005, our largest customer, Wal-Mart, accounted for 23% of
consolidated net revenues.

Financial
Instruments

The estimated
fair values of financial instruments have been determined using available
market information and valuation methodologies described below. However,
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein may not be
indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. The
use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a
material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

The carrying
amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. Short-term
investments are carried at fair value with fair values being estimated based on
quoted market prices.

We account for
derivative instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and
Certain Hedging Activities, an amendment of SFAS No. 133” and SFAS No. 149, “Amendment
of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No.
133, 138, and 149 require that all derivatives, including foreign exchange
contracts, be recognized in the balance sheet in other current assets or
accrued expenses at their fair value.

We utilize
forward contracts in order to reduce financial market risks. These instruments
are used to hedge foreign currency exposures of underlying assets or liabilities.
Our accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether they meet
the criteria for designation as hedging transactions. Changes in fair value of
derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, are highly effective, and
qualify as hedging instruments, are recorded in other comprehensive income
until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings within the financial
statement line item consistent with the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of
a derivative change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. Changes
in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify as hedging instruments are
recorded in earnings. The fair value of foreign currency contracts is estimated
based on the spot rate of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the
period. As of March 31, 2007, accrued expenses included approximately $90,000
of pre-tax unrealized losses for the estimated fair value of outstanding
foreign currency exchange forward contracts, which was recorded in earnings as
the contracts did not qualify as hedging instruments. As of March 31, 2006, we
had no outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts.

Equity Investments

From time to
time, we may make a capital investment and hold a minority interest in a
third-party developer in connection with entertainment software products to be
developed by such developer for us. We account for those capital investments
over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence using the
equity method. For

F-8

those
investments over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence, we account for our investment using the cost method.

Software
Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses

Software
development costs include payments made to independent software developers
under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for internally
developed products.

We account for software development costs in
accordance with

Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or
Otherwise Marketed.” Software development costs are capitalized once the
technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are
determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product
encompasses both technical design documentation and game design documentation. For
products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the
development cycle. Technological feasibility is evaluated on a
product-by-product basis. Prior to a product’s release, we expense, as part of “cost
of sales – software royalties and amortization,” capitalized costs when we
believe such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized costs for those products
that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in
the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are
not capitalized are charged immediately to product development expense. We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis.
The recoverability of capitalized
software development costs is evaluated based on the expected performance of
the specific products for which the costs relate.

Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance
include: historical performance of comparable products using comparable
technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and estimated performance
of a sequel product based on the performance of the product on which the sequel
is based.

Commencing
upon product release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to “cost
of sales – software royalties and amortization” based on the ratio of current
revenues to total projected revenues, generally resulting in an amortization
period of six months or less. For products that have been released in prior
periods, we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts on a
quarterly basis. The primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance.

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when
technological feasibility is established, as well as in the ongoing assessment
of the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of
capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes
forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If
revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than, and/or revised
forecasted or actual costs are greater than, the original forecasted amounts
utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may
be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in
an impairment charge.

Intellectual
property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property
rights holders for use of their trademarks, copyrights, software, technology, music
or other intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our
products. Depending upon the agreement with the rights holder, we may obtain
the rights to use acquired intellectual property in multiple products over
multiple years, or alternatively, for a single product.

We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized
intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis. The recoverability of
capitalized intellectual property license costs is evaluated based on the
expected performance of the specific products in which the licensed trademark or
copyright is to be used. As many of our intellectual property licenses extend
for multiple products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of
capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative
factors, such as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles
utilizing the intellectual property, whether there are any future planned
theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property,
and the rights holder’s continued promotion and exploitation of the
intellectual property. Prior to the related product’s release, we expense, as
part of “cost of sales – intellectual property licenses,” capitalized
intellectual property costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized
intellectual property costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned
are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation. Criteria
used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance
of comparable products using comparable technology; orders for the

F-9

product prior to its release; and estimated
performance of a sequel product based on the performance of the product on
which the sequel is based.

Commencing
upon the related product’s release, capitalized intellectual property license
costs are amortized to “cost of sales – intellectual property licenses” based
on the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected
revenues for all products in which the licensed property will be utilized. As
intellectual property license contracts may extend for multiple years, the
amortization of capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to
such contracts may extend beyond one year. For intellectual property included
in products that have been released, we evaluate the future recoverability of
capitalized amounts on a quarterly basis. The primary evaluation criterion is
actual title performance.

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the
recoverability of capitalized costs.

In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of
expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of
additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales
are less than, and/or revised forecasted or actual costs are greater than, the
original forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis,
the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given
quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Additionally, as noted
above, as many of our intellectual property licenses extend for multiple
products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized
intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors such
as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the
intellectual property, whether there are any future planned theatrical releases
or television series based on the intellectual property and the rights holder’s
continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property. Material
differences may result in the amount and timing of charges for any period if
management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in
evaluating these qualitative factors.

Inventories

Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.

Property and
Equipment

Property and
equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided
using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives
or the lease term: buildings, 25 to 33 years; computer equipment, office
furniture and other equipment, 2 to 5 years; leasehold improvements, through the
life of the lease. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and
accumulated depreciation thereon are removed and any resulting gains or losses
are recognized in current operations.

Goodwill

We account for
goodwill using the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles.”
SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting requirements for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is
deemed to have an indefinite useful life and should not be amortized but rather
tested at least annually for impairment. An impairment loss should be
recognized if the carrying amount of goodwill is not recoverable and its
carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Our impairment tests as of March 31,
2007, 2006, and 2005 did not indicate that goodwill was impaired. In accordance
with SFAS No. 142, we have not amortized goodwill during the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005.

Revenue Recognition

We
recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of title and
risk of loss to our customers. Certain products are sold to customers with a
street date (i.e., a date on which products are made widely available by
retailers). For these products we recognize revenue no earlier than the street
date. Revenue from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated
allowance for returns and price protection. With respect to license agreements
that provide customers the right to make multiple copies in exchange for
guaranteed amounts, revenue is recognized upon delivery of such copies. Per
copy royalties on sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned. With
respect to on-line transactions, such as electronic downloads of titles or
product add-ons, revenue is recognized when the fee is paid by the on-line
customer to purchase online content and we are notified by the

F-10

online
retailer that the product has been downloaded. In addition, in order to
recognize revenue for both product sales and licensing transactions, persuasive
evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection of the related receivable
must be probable. Revenue recognition also determines the timing of certain
expenses, including “cost of sales – intellectual property licenses” and “cost
of sales – software royalties and amortization.”

Sales incentives or other
consideration given by us to our customers are accounted for in accordance with
the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer
(Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products).” In accordance with EITF Issue
01-9, sales incentives and other consideration that are considered adjustments
of the selling price of our products, such as rebates and product placement
fees, are reflected as reductions of revenue. Sales incentives and other
consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services
received, such as the appearance of our products in a customer’s national
circular ad, are reflected as sales and marketing expenses.

Allowances
for Returns, Price Protection, Doubtful Accounts, and Inventory Obsolescence

In determining the
appropriate unit shipments to our customers, we benchmark our titles using
historical and industry data. We
closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles,
the performance of products released by other publishers, and the anticipated
timing of other releases in order to assess future demands of current and
upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and
subsequent reorders are evaluated to ensure that quantities are sufficient to
meet the demands from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled
to prevent excess inventory in the channel.

We may permit product returns
from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In
general, price protection refers to the circumstances when we elect to decrease
the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and
applicable, allows customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to
us with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers
must meet to be granted the right to return products or price protection are,
among other things, compliance with applicable payment terms, and consistent
delivery to us of inventory and sell-through reports. We may also consider
other factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other
market factors. Management must make estimates of potential future product
returns and price protection related to current period product revenue. We
estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for current period
product revenue utilizing historical experience and information regarding
inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end
consumer. The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future
returns and price protection for a particular title: historical performance of
titles in similar genres; historical performance of the hardware platform;
historical performance of the brand; console hardware life cycle; Activision
sales force and retail customer feedback; industry pricing; weeks of on-hand
retail channel inventory; absolute quantity of on-hand retail channel
inventory; our warehouse on-hand inventory levels; the title’s recent
sell-through history (if available); marketing trade programs; and competing
titles. The relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending
upon, among other items, genre, platform, seasonality, and sales strategy. Significant
management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with
establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting
period. Based upon historical experience we believe our estimates are
reasonable. However, actual returns and price protection could vary materially
from our allowance estimates due to a number of reasons including, among
others, a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the same
period of a similarly themed title by a competitor, or technological
obsolescence due to the emergence of new hardware platforms. Material
differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period
if factors or market conditions change or if management makes different
judgments or utilizes different estimates in determining the allowances for
returns and price protection. For example, a 1% change in our March 31, 2007
allowance for returns and price protection would impact net revenues by $0.9
million.

Similarly, management must
make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable. In
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze the age of current
outstanding account balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations,
customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes in our
customers’ payment terms and their economic condition, as well as whether we
can obtain sufficient credit insurance. Any significant changes in any of these
criteria would affect management’s estimates in establishing our allowance for
doubtful accounts.

We value
inventory at the lower of cost or market. We regularly review inventory
quantities on hand and in the retail channel and record a provision for excess
or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for

F-11

our products.
Significant changes in demand for our products would impact management’s
estimates in establishing our inventory provision.

Shipping and
Handling

Shipping and
handling costs, which consist primarily of packaging and transportation charges
incurred to move finished goods to customers, are included in cost of sales –
product costs.

Advertising
Expenses

We expense
advertising as incurred, except for production costs associated with media
advertising which are deferred and charged to expense the first time the
related ad is run. Advertising expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31,
2007, 2006, and 2005 were approximately $98.4 million, $192.6 million, and $150.7
million, respectively, and are included in sales and marketing expense in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Investment Income,
Net

Investment
income, net is comprised of the following, (amounts in thousands):

Income Taxes

We account for
income taxes using SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under SFAS No.
109, income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.

Foreign Currency
Translation

The functional
currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are their local currencies. All assets
and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at
the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period, and revenue and expenses
are translated at weighted average exchange rates during the period. The
resulting translation adjustments are reflected as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.

Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive
income includes net income, unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on
short-term investments, foreign currency translation adjustments, and, if
applicable, the effective portion of gains or losses on cash flow hedges that
are presented as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
in shareholders’ equity.

F-12

Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities or the disclosure of gain or loss contingencies at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Earnings Per
Common Share

Basic earnings
per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for all periods. Diluted
earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding,
increased by common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents are calculated
using the treasury stock method and represent incremental shares issuable upon
exercise of our outstanding options and warrants and, if applicable in the period,
conversion of our convertible debt. However, potential common shares are not
included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation when
inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a
net loss is recorded.

Stock-Based Compensation

On April 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”),
which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee
stock options and employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (“employee stock purchases”), based on estimated fair values.
SFAS 123R supersedes our previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”). In
March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB 107”)
relating to SFAS 123R. We have applied the provisions of SAB 107 in our
adoption of SFAS 123R.

We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method,
which requires the application of the accounting standard as of April 1, 2006,
the first day of our fiscal year 2007. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements
as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 reflect the impact of SFAS
123R. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not been
restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123R. See Note 14
for additional information.

In
November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB
Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 123(R)-3, “Transition Election Related to
Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards” (“FSP 123R-3”). We
have elected not to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FSP
123R-3 for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to
SFAS 123R. We followed paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123R to calculate the initial
pool (“APIC pool”) of excess tax benefits and to determine the subsequent
impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax
effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon
adoption of SFAS 123R.

SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based
payment awards on the measurement date using an option-pricing model. The value
of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized
as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statement of
Operations. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS 123R for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 was $25.5 million. Prior to the adoption of
SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for stock-based awards to employees and
directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25 as allowed
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”).

Under APB 25, compensation expense was
recorded for the issuance of stock options and other stock-based compensation
based on the intrinsic value of the stock options and other stock-based
compensation on the date of grant or measurement date. Under the intrinsic
value method, compensation expense was recorded on the measurement date only if
the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the stock option or
other stock-based award’s exercise price. For the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2006 and 2005, we recognized $3.1 million and $3.4

F-13

million, respectively, in stock-based compensation expense related to
employee stock options and restricted stock, under APB 25. See Note 14 for
additional information.

Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based
on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that is ultimately
expected to vest during the period. Stock-based compensation expense recognized
in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2007 includes compensation expense for share-based payment awards granted
prior to, but not yet vested as of, April 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair
value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS 123, and
compensation expense for the share-based payment awards granted subsequent to
April 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS 123R. As stock-based compensation expense recognized in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2007 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for
estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the
time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates.

As of April 1, 2005, we changed our method of valuation for share-based
awards to a binomial-lattice model from the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
(“Black-Scholes model”) which was used for options granted prior to April 1,
2005 for FAS 123 fair value disclosures. For additional information, see Note
14. Our determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date
of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well
as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables.
These variables include, but are not limited to our expected stock price
volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock
option exercise behaviors.

2.

Stock Splits

In February
2005, the Board of Directors approved a four-for-three split of our outstanding
common shares effected in the form of a 33-1/3% stock dividend. The split was
paid March 22, 2005 to shareholders of record as of March 7, 2005. In September
2005, the Board of Directors approved a four-for-three split of our outstanding
common shares effected in the form of a 33-1/3% stock dividend. The split was
paid October 24, 2005 to shareholders of record as of October 10, 2005. The par
value of our common stock was maintained at the pre-split amount of $.000001. The
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, including all share and
per share data, have been restated as if the stock splits had occurred as of
the earliest period presented.

On March 7,
2005, in connection with our March 22, 2005 stock split, all shares of common
stock held as treasury stock were formally cancelled and restored to the status
of authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

3.

Acquisitions

During
the three years ended March 31, 2007, we separately completed the acquisition
of four privately held interactive software development companies. We accounted
for these acquisitions in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.”
SFAS No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business
combinations, requiring that the purchase method be used to account and report
for all business combinations. These acquisitions have further enabled us to
implement our multi-platform development strategy by bolstering our internal
product development capabilities for console systems and personal computers and
strengthening our position in the first-person action, action/adventure, music-based
gaming and action sports game categories. A significant portion of the purchase
price for all of these acquisitions was assigned to goodwill as the primary
asset we acquired in each of the transactions was an assembled workforce with
proven technical and design talent with a history of high quality product
creation. Pro forma Consolidated Statements of Operations for these
acquisitions, are not shown, as they would not differ materially from reported
results.

RedOctane, Inc.

On June 6, 2006, we completed our acquisition of 100% of RedOctane,
Inc. (“RedOctane”) for an aggregate accounting purchase price of
$99.9 million, including transaction costs, consisting of $30.9 million in
cash and 2,382,077 shares of Activision common stock valued at approximately $30.0
million based upon prevailing market prices which was issued on the closing
date, and $39.0 million payable in Activision common stock

F-14

within two years of the closing date, which is recorded in other
liabilities. In addition, i

n the event the net income of the business over a
certain period of time exceeds specified target levels by certain amounts,
certain former shareholders of RedOctane will be entitled to an additional
amount of up to $51.0 million payable in shares of Activision common stock. The
contingent consideration will be recorded as an additional element of the
purchase price if those contingencies are achieved. Based in Sunnyvale,
California, RedOctane is a publisher, developer, and distributor of interactive
entertainment software, hardware and accessories. RedOctane offers its
interactive entertainment products in versions that operate on the PS2, Xbox
360, and PC, and its leading software product offering is

Guitar Hero

.
RedOctane also designs, manufactures, and markets high quality video game
peripherals and accessories. This acquisition provides Activision with an early
leadership position in music-based gaming, which we expect will be one of the
fastest growing genres in the coming years.

The results of operations of RedOctane and the estimated fair market
values of the acquired assets and liabilities have been included in the
Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition. Pro forma Consolidated
Statements of Operations for this acquisition are not shown, as they would not
differ materially from reported results. The acquired, finite-lived intangible
assets are being amortized over estimated lives ranging from 0.6 to 1.6 years. Goodwill
has been included in the publishing segment of our business and is
non-deductible for tax purposes.

Auction rate
securities are securities that are structured with short-term reset dates of
generally less than 90 days but with maturities in excess of 90 days. At the
end of the reset period, investors can sell or continue to hold the securities
at par. These securities are classified in the table below based on their legal
stated maturity dates.

The following
table summarizes the final maturities of our investments in securities as of
March 31, 2007 (amounts in thousands):

For the years
ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 net realized gains on investments
consisted of $1.8 million, $4.3 million, and $471,000 of gross realized gains,
respectively, and no gross realized losses.

F-17

In accordance
with EITF 03-1, “

The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,”

the
fair value of investments in an unrealized loss position for which an
other-than-temporary impairment has not been recognized was $496.2 million and
$672.4 million at March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, with related gross
unrealized losses of $1.5 million and $5.5 million, respectively. At March 31,
2007, the gross unrealized losses were comprised mostly of unrealized losses on
U.S. agency issues, corporate bonds, and mortgage-backed securities with $1.1 million
of unrealized loss being in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve
months or greater. At March 31, 2006, the gross unrealized losses were
comprised mostly of unrealized losses on U.S. agency issues, corporate bonds,
and mortgage-backed securities with $3.9 million of unrealized loss being in a
continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or greater.

The Company’s
investment portfolio usually consists of government and corporate securities
with effective maturities less than 30 months. The longer the term of the
securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market rates of
interest and yields on bonds. Investments are reviewed periodically to identify
possible impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews
factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below
cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company’s ability
and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient
for anticipated recovery in market value. The Company has the intent and
ability to hold these securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for
a forecasted recovery of fair value up to (or beyond) the initial cost of the
investment. The Company expects to realize the full value of all of these
investments upon maturity or sale.

Software
Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses

As of March 31,
2007, capitalized software development costs included $94.3 million of
internally developed software costs and $36.6 million of payments made to
third-party software developers. As of March 31, 2006, capitalized software
development costs included $45.0 million of internally developed software costs
and $15.6 million of payments made to third-party software developers. Capitalized
intellectual property licenses were $100.3 million and $87.0 million as of
March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Amortization and write-offs of
capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses, including
capitalizated stock-based compensation expense, was $94.0 million, $173.6
million, and $134.8 million for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively.

Operations by Reportable Segments and Geographic Area

We operate two business
segments: (i) publishing of interactive entertainment software and peripherals
and (ii) distribution of interactive entertainment software and hardware
products.

Publishing refers to the
development, marketing, and sale of products directly, by license or through
our affiliate label program with certain third-party publishers. In the United
States, we primarily sell our products on a direct basis to mass-market
retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game specialty
stores. We conduct our international publishing activities through offices in
the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Australia, Sweden,
Canada, South Korea and Japan. Our products are sold internationally on a
direct-to-retail basis and through third-party distribution and licensing
arrangements and through our wholly-owned distribution subsidiaries located in
the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany.

Distribution refers to our
operations in the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany that provide logistical and
sales services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software,
our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment
hardware.

Resources are allocated to
each of these segments using information on their respective net revenues and
operating profits before interest and taxes.

The accounting policies of
these segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies. Transactions between segments are eliminated in
consolidation.

A significant portion of our
revenues is derived from products based on a relatively small number of popular
brands each year. In fiscal 2007, 39% of our consolidated net revenues (52% of
worldwide publishing net revenues) was derived from three brands, which
accounted for 17%, 13%, and 9% of consolidated net revenues (23%, 18%, and 11%
of worldwide publishing net revenues). In fiscal 2006, 30% of our consolidated
net revenues (38% of worldwide publishing net revenues) was derived from three
brands, which accounted for 14%, 8%, and 8% of consolidated net revenues (18%,
10%, and 10% of worldwide publishing net revenues). In fiscal 2005, 37% of our
consolidated net revenues (48% of worldwide publishing net revenues) was
derived from three brands, which accounted for 16%, 11%, and 10% of
consolidated net revenues (21%, 14%, and 13% of worldwide publishing net
revenues).

The items accounting for the
difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory income
tax rate and the income tax provision for each of the years are as follows:

Deferred income taxes
reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the amounts of
assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the amounts used for income
tax purposes. The components of the net deferred tax asset and liability are as
follows (amounts in thousands):

F-25

The tax benefits associated
with certain net operating loss carryforwards relate to employee stock options.
For the year ended March 31, 2006, pursuant to SFAS No. 109, deferred tax
assets for net operating losses did not include $30.9 million relating to these
items which will be credited to additional paid-in capital when realized. For
the year ended March 31, 2007, $30.9 million relating to these items was
realized and included in deferred tax assets for net operating losses; however,
a reserve was established for this amount, as well as a reserve of $20.6
million for tax credits and foreign taxes. These reserves were established
because the tax positions are subject to certain assumptions of the relevant
legislative and judicial history that may or may not be accepted by the tax
authorities.

As of March 31, 2007, our
available federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $34.9
million is subject to certain limitations as defined under Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforwards expire between 2022
and 2026. We have various state net operating loss carryforwards totaling $17.6
million which are not subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code. We have tax credit carryforwards of $52.5 million and $36.5
million for federal and state purposes, respectively, which begin to expire in fiscal
year 2008.

At March 31, 2007, our
deferred income tax asset for tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss
carryforwards was reduced by a valuation allowance of $0.4 million, as compared
to $35.6 million in the prior fiscal year. In management’s judgment, based on
the utilization of domestic net operating loss carryforwards in the current
fiscal year, it was determined to be more likely than not that the tax credit
carryforwards would ultimately be utilized, and consequently, the valuation
allowance relating to tax credit carryforwards was reversed.

Realization of the deferred
tax assets is dependent upon the continued generation of sufficient taxable
income prior to expiration of tax credits and loss carryforwards. Although
realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that
the net carrying value of the deferred tax asset will be realized.

Cumulative undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided
approximated $97.5 million at March 31, 2007. Deferred income taxes on these
earnings have not been provided as these amounts are considered to be permanent
in duration.

On October 22, 2004, the
President of the United States signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(the “Act”) which contains a number of tax law modifications with accounting
implications. For companies that pay U.S. income taxes on manufacturing
activities in the U.S., the Act provides a deduction from taxable income equal
to a stipulated percentage of qualified income from domestic production
activities. The manufacturing deduction provided by the Act replaces the extraterritorial
income (“ETI”) deduction currently in place. We currently derive benefits from
the ETI exclusion which was repealed by the Act. Our exclusion for fiscal 2006
and 2007 will be limited to 75% and 45% of the otherwise allowable exclusion
and no exclusion will be available in fiscal 2008 and thereafter. The Act also
creates a temporary incentive for U.S. multinationals to repatriate accumulated
income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for
certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations (“Homeland Investment
Act”). The deduction is subject to a number of limitations. The Act also
provides for other changes in tax law that will affect a variety of taxpayers.
On December 21, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
two FASB Staff Positions (“FSP”) regarding the accounting implications of the
Act related to (1) the deduction for qualified domestic production activities
and (2) the one-time tax benefit for the repatriation of foreign earnings. The
FASB determined that the deduction for qualified domestic production activities
should be accounted for as a special deduction under FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. The FASB also
confirmed, that upon deciding that some amount of earnings will be repatriated,
a company must record in that period the associated tax liability. The guidance
in the FSPs apply to financial statements for periods ending after the date the
Act was enacted. We have evaluated the Act and have concluded that we will not
repatriate foreign earnings under the Homeland Investment Act Provisions.

Commitments and Contingencies

Credit
Facilities

We have revolving credit
facilities with our Centresoft subsidiary located in the UK (the “UK Facility”)
and our NBG subsidiary located in Germany (the “German Facility”). The UK
Facility provided Centresoft with the ability to borrow up to Great British
Pounds (“GBP”) 12.0 million ($23.6 million) and GBP 12.0 million ($21.0
million, including issuing letters of credit, on a revolving basis as of March
31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Furthermore, under the UK Facility, Centresoft
provided a GBP 0.6 million ($1.2 million) and a GBP 0.6 million ($1.0 million)
guarantee for the benefit of our CD Contact subsidiary as of March 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The UK Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.0% as of
March 31, 2007 and 2006, is collateralized by substantially all of the assets
of the subsidiary and expires in January 2008. The UK Facility also contains
various covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial
ratios related to, among others, fixed charges. As of March 31, 2007 and 2006,
we were in compliance with these covenants. No borrowings were outstanding
against the UK Facility as of March 31, 2007 or 2006. The German Facility
provided for revolving loans up to EUR 0.5 million ($0.7 million) as of March
31, 2007 and EUR 0.5 million ($0.6 million) as of March 31, 2006, bore interest
at a Eurocurrency rate plus 2.5%, is collateralized by certain of the
subsidiary’s property and equipment and has no expiration date. No borrowings
were outstanding against the German Facility as of March 31, 2007 or 2006.

As of March 31, 2007 and
2006, we maintained a $7.5 million irrevocable standby letter of credit. The
standby letter of credit is required by one of our inventory manufacturers to
qualify for payment terms on our inventory purchases. Under the terms of this
arrangement, we are required to maintain on deposit with the bank a
compensating balance, restricted as to use, of not less than the sum of the
available amount of the letter of credit plus the aggregate amount of any
drawings under the letter of credit that have been honored thereunder but not
reimbursed. At March 31, 2007 and 2006, the $7.5 million deposit is included in
short-term investments as restricted cash. No borrowings were outstanding as of
March 31, 2007 or 2006.

As of March 31, 2007, our
publishing subsidiary located in the UK maintained a EUR 4.0 million ($5.3
million) irrevocable standby letter of credit. As of March 31, 2006, our
publishing subsidiary located in the UK maintained a EUR 2.5 million ($3.0
million) irrevocable standby letter of credit. The standby letter of credit is
required by one of our inventory manufacturers to qualify for payment terms on
our inventory purchases. The standby letter of credit does not require a
compensating balance and is collateralized by substantially all of the assets
of the subsidiary and expires in August 2007. No borrowings were outstanding as
of March 31, 2007 or 2006.

Commitments

In the normal course of
business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for
non-cancelable operating lease agreements for our offices, for the development
of products, as well as for the rights to intellectual property. Under these
agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor, developer, or
intellectual property holder, based upon contractual arrangements. Typically,
the payments to third-party developers are conditioned upon the achievement by
the developers of contractually specified development milestones. These
payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders typically
are deemed to be advances and are recoupable against future royalties earned by
the developer or intellectual property holder based on the sale of the related
game. Additionally, in connection with certain intellectual property right
acquisitions and development agreements, we will commit to spend specified
amounts for marketing support for the related game(s) which is to be developed
or in which the intellectual property will be utilized.

F-27

Additionally, we lease
certain of our facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating lease
agreements. Assuming all contractual provisions are met, the total future
minimum commitments for these and other contractual arrangements in place as of
March 31, 2007, are scheduled to be paid as follows (amounts in thousands):

Facilities rent expense for
the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was approximately $14.8 million,
$14.2 million, and $10.6 million, respectively.

Compensation
Guarantee

In June 2005, we entered
into an employment agreement with the President and Chief Executive Officer of
Activision Publishing, Inc. containing a guarantee related to total
compensation. The agreement guarantees that in the event that on May 15, 2010
total compensation has not exceeded $20.0 million, we will make a payment for
the amount of the shortfall. The $20.0 million guarantee will be recognized as
compensation expense over the term of the employment agreement comprising of
salary payments, bonus payments, restricted stock expense, stock option
expense, and an accrual for any anticipated remaining portion of the guarantee.
The remaining portion of the guarantee is accrued over the term of the
agreement in “Other liabilities” and will remain accrued until the end of the
employment agreement at which point it will be used to make a payment for any
shortfall or reclassified into shareholders’ equity.

Legal
Proceedings

In July 2006, individuals
and/or entities claiming to be stockholders of the Company have filed
derivative lawsuits, purportedly on behalf of the Company, against certain
current and former members of the Company’s Board of Directors as well as
several current and former officers of the Company. Three derivative actions
have been filed in Los Angeles Superior Court: Vazquez v. Kotick, et al

.

, L.A.S.C. Case No. BC355327 (filed July
12, 2006); Greuer v. Kotick, et al.

,

L.A.S.C. Case No. SC090343 (filed July 12, 2006); and Amalgamated Bank v.
Baker, et al., L.A.S.C. Case No. BC356454 (filed August 3, 2006). These actions
have been consolidated by the court under the caption In re Activision
Shareholder Derivative Litigation, L.A.S.C. Master File No. SC090343 (West,
J.). Two derivative actions have been filed in the United States District Court
for the Central District of California: Pfeiffer v. Kotick, et al., C.D. Cal.
Case No. CV06-4771 MRP (JTLx) (filed July 31, 2006); and Hamian v. Kotick, et
al

.

, C.D. Cal. Case No. CV06-5375
MRP (JLTx) (filed August 25, 2006). These actions have also been consolidated,
under the caption In re Activision, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation,
C.D. Cal. Case No. CV06-4771 MRP (JTLx) (Pfaelzer, J.). The consolidated
complaints allege, among other things, purported improprieties in the Company’s
issuance of stock options. Plaintiffs seek various relief on behalf of the Company,
including damages, restitution of benefits obtained from the alleged
misconduct, equitable relief, including an accounting and rescission of option
contracts; and various corporate governance reforms. The Company expects that
defense expenses associated with the matters will be covered by its directors
and officers insurance, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable
policies. On May

F-28

24, 2007, the Superior Court
granted the Company’s motion to stay the state action. The court’s order stays
the action pending the resolution of motions to dismiss in the federal action,
but is without prejudice to any party’s right to seek modification of the stay
upon a showing of good cause, including a showing that matters may be addressed
in the Superior Court without the potential for conflict with or duplication of
the federal court proceedings. The Company filed motions to dismiss in the
federal action on June 1, 2007, which will be fully briefed by August 15, 2007.
The Company was also informed that, on June 1, 2007, a derivative case,
Abdelnur vs. Kotick et al., was filed in the United States District Court for
the Central District of California, C.D. Case No. CV07-3575 AHM (PJWx), by the
same law firm that previously filed the Hamian case, alleging substantially the
same claims.

On July 27, 2006, the
Company received a letter of informal inquiry from the SEC requesting certain
documents and information relating to the Company’s historical stock option
grant practices. In early June 2007, the SEC informed the Company that the SEC
has issued a formal order of non-public investigation, which allows the SEC,
among other things, to subpoena witnesses and require the production of
documents. The Company is cooperating with the SEC’s investigation, and
representatives of the special subcommittee of independent members of our Board
of Directors established in July 2006 to review our historical stock option
granting practices (the “Special Subcommittee”) and its legal counsel have met
with members of the staff of the SEC on several occasions, in person and by
telephone (as has the Company’s outside legal counsel), to discuss the progress
of the Special Subcommittee’s investigation and on February 28, 2007 to brief
the SEC staff on the Special Subcommittee’s findings and recommendations
following the substantial completion of the Special Subcommittee’s
investigation. A representative of the U.S. Department of Justice has attended
certain of these meetings and requested copies of certain documents that we
have provided to the staff of the SEC. At this time, the Company has not
received any grand jury subpoenas or written requests from the Department of
Justice.

In addition, we are party to
other routine claims and suits brought by us and against us in the ordinary
course of business, including disputes arising over the ownership of
intellectual property rights, contractual claims, employment relationships, and
collection matters. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal
counsel, the outcome of such routine claims and lawsuits will not have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations, or liquidity.

Stock-Based
Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans

We have a stock-based
compensation program that provides our Board of Directors broad discretion in
creating employee equity incentives. This program includes incentive and
non-statutory stock options and restricted stock awards granted under various
plans, the majority of which are stockholder approved. Stock options are
generally time-based, vesting on each annual anniversary of the grant date over
periods of three to five years and expire ten years from the grant date, with
some options containing performance clauses which would accelerate the vesting
into earlier annual periods. Additionally, we have an Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (“ESPP”) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at 85%
of the fair market value at either the date of enrollment or the date of
purchase, whichever is lower. Shares issued as a result of stock option
exercises and our ESPP are generally issued as new stock issuances. As of March
31, 2007, we had approximately 11.2 million shares of common stock reserved for
future issuance under our stock option plans and ESPP.

F-30

Under the terms of the
plans, the exercise price for Awards issued under the 1991 Plan, 1998 Plan,
1999 Plan, 2001 Plan, 2002 Plan, 2002 Executive Plan, 2002 Studio Plan, and
2003 Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) is determined at the discretion of the
Board of Directors (or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors,
which administers the Plans), and under the terms of the plans, the exercise
price for ISOs is not to be less than the fair market value of our common
stock at the date of grant, and in the case of non-qualified options, the
exercise price must exceed or be equal to 85% of the fair market value of
our common stock at the date of grant. Options typically become exercisable in
installments over a period of three to five years and must be exercised within
10 years of the date of grant.  We have recently determined that certain
Awards issued in certain past periods were issued with exercise prices below
the fair market value of our common stock on the dates that we have determined
to be the correct grant and measurement dates for those Awards.

Other
Employee Stock Options

In connection with prior
employment agreements between Activision and Robert A. Kotick, Activision’s
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian G. Kelly, Activision’s
Co-Chairman, Mr. Kotick and Mr. Kelly were granted options to purchase common
stock. The Board of Directors approved the granting of these options. Relating
to such grants, as of March 31, 2007, approximately 8,304,800 options were
outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $1.74.

We additionally have
approximately 9,500 options outstanding to employees as of March 31, 2007, with
a weighted average exercise price of $3.48. The Board of Directors approved the
granting of these options. Such options have terms similar to those options
granted under the Plans.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

On April 11, 2005, the Board
of Directors approved the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and on February 11,
2003 the Board approved the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for International
Employees (together, the “2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan”). Under the 2002
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, up to an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of our
common stock may be purchased by eligible employees during two six-month
offering periods that commence each April 1 and October 1 (the “Offering Period”).
Common stock is purchased by the Amended 2002 Purchase Plans participants at a
price per share generally equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of
the common stock on the first day of the Offering Period and the fair market
value of the common stock on the purchase date (the last day of the Offering
Period). Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of
their gross compensation during an Offering Period and are limited to a maximum
of $10,000 in value for any two purchases within the same calendar year. On
June 13, 2007, the most recent purchase date, employees purchased 228,337
shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $12.8350 per share.

Non-Employee
Warrants

In prior years, we have
granted stock warrants to third parties in connection with the development of
software and the acquisition of licensing rights for intellectual property. The
warrants generally vest upon grant and are exercisable over the term of the
warrant. The exercise price of third-party warrants is generally greater than
or equal to their fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant.
No third-party warrants were granted during the years ended March 31, 2007,
2006, and 2005. As of March 31, 2007 and 2006, third-party warrants to purchase
936,000 shares of common stock were outstanding with a weighted average exercise
price of $4.54 per share.

In accordance with EITF
96-18, we measure the fair value of the securities on the measurement date. The
fair value of each warrant is capitalized and amortized to expense when the
related product is released and the related revenue is recognized.
Additionally, as more fully described in Note 1, the recoverability of
capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses is
evaluated on a quarterly basis with amounts determined as not recoverable being
charged to expense. In connection with the evaluation of capitalized software
development costs and intellectual property licenses, any capitalized amounts
for related third-party warrants are additionally reviewed for recoverability
with amounts determined as not recoverable being amortized to expense. As of
March 31, 2006, capitalized amounts of third-party warrants had been fully
amortized and there was no amortization related to third-party warrants for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and
2005, $0.5 and $1.6 million, respectively was amortized and included in cost of
sales - software royalties and amortization and/or cost of sales - intellectual
property licenses.

F-31

Employee
Retirement Plan

We have a retirement plan
covering substantially all of our eligible employees. The retirement plan is
qualified in accordance with Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under
the plan, employees may defer up to the lesser of 92% of their pre-tax salary
and the maximum amount allowed by law. We contribute an amount equal to 20% of
each dollar contributed by a participant. Our matching contributions to the
plan were approximately $1.5 million, $1.3 million, and $905,000 for the years
ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Restricted
Stock

In June 2005, we issued the
rights to 155,763 shares of restricted stock to an employee. Additionally, in
October 2005 we issued the rights to 96,712 shares of restricted stock to an
employee. These shares all vest over a five-year period and remain subject to
forfeiture if vesting conditions are not met. In accordance with APB 25, we
recognized unearned compensation in connection with the grant of restricted
shares equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. The
fair value of these shares when issued was approximately $12.84 and $15.51 per
share, respectively, and resulted in a total increase in “Additional paid-in
capital” and “Unearned compensation” of $2.0 million and $1.5 million on the
respective balance sheets at the times of grant. Prior to the adoption of SFAS
123R, we reduced unearned compensation and recognized compensation expense over
the vesting periods. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, unearned compensation was
reclassified against additional paid in capital and we will increase additional
paid in capital and recognize compensation expense over the respective
remaining vesting periods. Additionally, in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 we
issued the rights to an aggregate of 81,000 shares of restricted stock to
various employees. These shares vest over two and three year periods (with some
subject to vesting acceleration clauses if the holder achieves certain
performance objectives) and remain subject to forfeiture if vesting conditions
are not met. In accordance with SFAS 123R we will recognize compensation
expense and increase additional paid in capital related to these restricted
stock shares over the requisite service period. For the year ended March 31,
2007, we recorded expenses related to these shares of approximately $981,000,
which was included as a component of stock-based compensation expense within “General
and administrative” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Since the issuance dates, we have recognized $1.4 million of the $4.8 million
total fair value, with the remainder to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 2.88 years.

On April 1, 2006, we adopted
the provisions of SFAS 123R, requiring us to recognize expense related to the
fair value of our stock-based compensation awards. We elected to use the
modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS 123R and therefore
have not restated our financial results for prior periods. Under this transition
method, stock-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2007
includes compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted
prior to, but not yet vested as of April 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair
value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123.
Stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards
granted subsequent to April 1, 2006 was based on the grant-date fair value,
estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R.

The effect of
adopting SFAS 123R in the year ended March 31, 2007 was as follows:

The following table sets
forth the total stock-based compensation expense resulting from stock options,
restricted stock awards, and the ESPP included in our Consolidated Statements
of Operations (in thousands) in accordance with SFAS 123R for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2007, and APB 25 for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and
2005:

F-32

Additionally, stock option
expenses are capitalized in accordance with SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed” as
discussed in Note 1. For the year ended March 31, 2007, stock-based
compensation costs in the amount of $9.1 million were capitalized and $2.5
million of capitalized stock-based compensation costs were amortized. The
following table summarizes stock –based compensation included in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of software development (in
thousands):

Net cash proceeds from the
exercise of stock options were $19.0 million, $45.1 million, and $72.7 million
for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Income tax
benefit from stock option exercises was $11.3 million, $29.4 million, and $53.2
million for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. In
accordance with SFAS 123R, we present excess tax benefits from the exercise of
stock options, if any, as financing cash flows rather than operating cash
flows.

Prior to the adoption of
SFAS 123R, we applied SFAS 123, amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure” (“SFAS 148”), which
allowed companies to apply the existing accounting rules under APB 25 and
related Interpretations. According to APB 25, a non-cash stock-based
compensation expense is recognized for any options granted where the exercise
price is lower than the market price on the actual date of grant. This expense
is then amortized over the vesting period of the associated option. As required
by SFAS 148, prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we provided pro forma net
income and pro forma net income per common share disclosures for stock-based
awards, as if the fair-value-based method defined in SFAS 123 had been applied.

F-33

The following table
illustrates the effect on net income after tax and net earnings per common
share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to
stock-based compensation during the years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 (in
thousands, except per share amounts):

In the table above,
stock-based compensation has been tax effected using our effective tax rate
which differs from our statutory rate. Additionally, included in fiscal year
2006 net income, as reported, is $467,000 of amortization of unearned
compensation related to restricted stock.

As of April 1, 2005, the
Company began estimating the value of employee stock options on the date of
grant using a binomial-lattice model. Prior to April 1, 2005 the value of each
employee stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes model for the purpose of the pro forma financial information in
accordance with SFAS 123.

Our employee stock options
have features that differentiate them from exchange-traded options. These
features include lack of transferability, early exercise, vesting restrictions,
pre- and post-vesting termination provisions, blackout dates, and time-varying
inputs. In addition, some of the options have non-traditional features, such as
accelerated vesting upon the satisfaction of certain performance conditions
that must be reflected in the valuation. A binomial-lattice model was selected
because it is better able to explicitly address these features than closed-form
models such as the Black-Scholes model, and is able to reflect expected future
changes in model inputs, including changes in volatility, during the option’s
contractual term.

Consistent with SFAS 123R,
we have attempted to reflect expected future changes in model inputs during the
option’s contractual term. The inputs required by our binomial-lattice model
include expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, risk-adjusted stock
return, dividend yield, contractual term, and vesting schedule, as well as
measures of employees’ forfeiture, exercise, and post-vesting termination
behavior. Statistical methods were used to estimate employee type specific
termination rates. These termination rates, in turn, were used to model the
number of options that are expected to vest and post-vesting termination
behavior. Employee type specific estimates of Expected Time-To-Exercise (“ETTE”)
were used to reflect employee exercise behavior. ETTE was estimated by using
statistical procedures to first estimate the conditional probability of
exercise occurring during each time period, conditional on the option surviving
to that time period. These probabilities are then used to estimate ETTE. The
model was calibrated by adjusting parameters controlling exercise and post-vesting
termination behavior so that the measures output by the model matched values of
these measures that were estimated from historical data. The weighted-average
estimated value of employee stock options granted during the years ended March
31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $5.86, $5.09, and $3.06 per share, respectively,
using the binomial-lattice model with the following weighted-average
assumptions:

F-34

To estimate volatility for
the binomial-lattice model, we use methods or capabilities that are discussed
in SFAS 123R and SAB 107. These methods included the implied volatility method
based upon the volatilities for exchange-traded options on our stock to
estimate short-term volatility, the historical method (annualized standard
deviation of the instantaneous returns on Activision’s stock) during the option’s
contractual term to estimate long-term volatility and a statistical model to
estimate the transition or “mean reversion” from short-term volatility to
long-term volatility. Based on these methods, for options granted during the
year ended March 31, 2007, the expected stock price volatility ranged from 38%
to 56%, with a weighted-average volatility of 54%. For options granted during
the year ended March 31, 2006, the expected stock price volatility ranged from
40% to 55%, with a weighted average volatility of 48%. For options granted
during the year ended March 31, 2005, the expected stock price volatility
ranged from 45% to 48%, with a weighted average volatility of 48%.

As is the case for
volatility, the risk-free rate is assumed to change during the option’s
contractual term. Consistent with the calculation required by a binomial
lattice model, the risk-free rate reflects the interest from one time period to
the next (“forward rate”) as opposed to the interest rate from the grant date
to the given time period (“spot rate”). Since we do not currently pay dividends
and are not expected to pay them in the future, we have assumed that the
dividend yield is zero.

The expected life of
employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options
are expected to remain outstanding and is, as required by SFAS 123R, an output
by the binomial-lattice model. The expected life of employee stock options
depends on all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. A
binomial-lattice model can be viewed as assuming that employees will exercise
their options when the stock price equals or exceeds an exercise boundary. The
exercise boundary is not constant but continually declines as one approaches
the option’s expiration date. The exact placement of the exercise boundary
depends on all of the model inputs as well as the measures that are used to
calibrate the model to estimated measures of employees’ exercise and
termination behavior.

As stock-based compensation
expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended March 31, 2007 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has
been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be
estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods
if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated
based on historical experience.

Accuracy of
Fair Value Estimates

The Company uses third-party
analyses to assist in developing the assumptions used in the binomial-lattice
model, including model inputs and measures of employees’ exercise and
post-vesting termination behavior. However, we are ultimately responsible for
the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our share-based payment
awards.

Our ability to accurately
estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards as of the grant date
depends upon the accuracy of the model and our ability to accurately forecast
model inputs as long as ten years into the future. These inputs include, but
are not limited to, expected stock price volatility, risk-free rate, dividend
yield, and employee termination rates. Although the fair value of employee
stock options is determined in accordance with SFAS 123R and SAB 107 using an
option-pricing model, the estimates that are produced by this model may not

F-35

be indicative of the fair
value observed between a willing buyer/willing seller. Unfortunately, it is
difficult to determine if this is the case, because markets do not currently
exist that permit the active trading of employee stock option and other
share-based instruments.

Stock option activity for
the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 is as follows (in thousands,
except per share amounts):

The following table shows
the weighted-average remaining contractual term and aggregate intrinsic value
for options outstanding and options exercisable at March 31, 2007 (amounts in
thousands):

The aggregate intrinsic
value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i.e., the
difference between our closing stock price on the last trading day of the
period and the exercise price, times the number of shares for options where the
exercise price is below the closing stock price) that would have been received
by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on that
date. This amount changes based on the fair market value of our stock. Total
intrinsic value of options actually exercised was $32.0 million, $77.9 million,
and $198.0 million for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively.

As of March 31, 2007, $34.0
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.61 years.

Capital Transactions

Buyback
Program

During fiscal 2003, our
Board of Directors authorized a buyback program under which we can repurchase
up to $350.0 million of our common stock. Under the program, shares may be
purchased as determined by management, from time to time and within certain
guidelines, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions,
including privately negotiated structured stock repurchase transactions and
through transactions in the options markets. Depending on market conditions and
other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or
from time to time without prior notice.

Under the buyback program,
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the years ended March
31, 2007, March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005. As of March 31, 2007, we had no
outstanding structured stock repurchase transactions. Structured stock
repurchase transactions are settled in cash or stock-based on the market price
of our common stock on the date of the settlement. Upon settlement, we either
have our capital investment returned with a premium or receive shares of our
common stock, depending, respectively, on whether the market price of our
common stock is above or below a pre-determined price agreed in connection with
each such transaction. These transactions are recorded in shareholders’ equity
in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2007, we had
approximately $226.2 million available for utilization under the buyback
program and no outstanding stock repurchase transactions.

F-37

Shareholders’
Rights Plan

On April 18, 2000, our Board
of Directors approved a shareholders rights plan (the “Rights Plan”). Under the
Rights Plan, each common shareholder at the close of business on April 19,
2000, received a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held. Each
right represents the right to purchase one-six hundredths (1/600) of a share,
as adjusted on account of stock dividends made since the plan’s adoption, of
our Series A Junior Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $6.67 per share, as
adjusted on account of stock dividends made since the plan’s adoption. Initially,
the rights are represented by our common stock certificates and are neither
exercisable nor traded separately from our common stock. The rights will only
become exercisable if a person or group acquires 15% or more of the common
stock of Activision, or announces or commences a tender or exchange offer which
would result in the bidder’s beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common
stock.

In the event that any person
or group acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock each holder of a
right (other than such person or members of such group) will thereafter have
the right to receive upon exercise of such right, in lieu of shares of Series A
Junior Preferred Stock, the number of shares of common stock of Activision
having a value equal to two times the then current exercise price of the right.
If we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after
a person has acquired 15% or more of our common stock, each holder of a right
will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such right a number
of the acquiring company’s common shares having a market value equal to two
times the then current exercise price of the right. For persons who, as of the
close of business on April 18, 2000, beneficially own 15% or more of the common
stock of Activision, the Rights Plan “grandfathers” their current level of
ownership, so long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of
certain limitations.

We may redeem the rights for
$.01 per right at any time until the first public announcement of the
acquisition of beneficial ownership of 15% of our common stock. At any time
after a person has acquired 15% or more (but before any person has acquired
more than 50%) of our common stock, we may exchange all or part of the rights
for shares of common stock at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock
per right. The rights expire on April 18, 2010.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards and Laws

In February 2006, the FASB
issued Statement No. 155 (“SFAS No. 155”),

Accounting
for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments – An amendment of FASB Statements No.
133 and 140.

SFAS No. 155 amends FASB Statements No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,

and No. 140,

Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities

to resolve issues addressed in Statement 133
Implementation Issue No. D1, “Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial
Interests in Securitized Financial Assets.” SFAS No. 155 permits fair value
remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded
derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation; clarifies which interest-only
strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of
Statement 133; establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized
financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or
that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative
requiring bifurcation; clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form
of subordination are not embedded derivatives; and amends Statement 140 to
eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a
derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other
than another derivative financial instrument. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all
financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity’s
first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We do not expect that
the adoption of SFAS No. 155 will have a material effect on our financial
position or results of operations.

In March 2006, the FASB
issued Statement No. 156 (“SFAS No. 156”),

Accounting
for Servicing of Financial Assets – an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140.

SFAS
No. 156 amends Statement No. 140,

Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities,

with respect to the accounting for separately
recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. SFAS No. 156 requires an
entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it
undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset

F-40

by entering into a servicing
contract in certain situations; requires all separately recognized servicing
assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value, if
practicable; permits either the “amortization method”

or the “fair value measurement method,”

as subsequent measurement methods for
each class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities;
permits a one-time reclassification of available-for-sale securities to trading
securities by entities with recognized servicing rights; and requires separate
presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently
measured at fair value in the statement of financial position and additional
disclosures for all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing
liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is effective in the first fiscal year that begins
after September 15, 2006. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 156
will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In July 2006, the FASB
issued Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”),

Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109.
FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum
recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being
recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
derecognition, measurement, classification, interest, and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. In addition, FIN 48 excludes
income taxes from the scope of SFAS No. 5,

Accounting
for Contingencies

.  FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006.  Differences between the amounts
recognized in the consolidated balance sheets prior to the adoption of FIN 48
and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a
cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained
earnings. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FIN 48
will have on our results of operations and financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB
issued Statement No. 157 (“SFAS No. 157”),

Fair
Value Measurements.

SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles,
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies
under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157
is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not
expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

In September 2006, the
SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 108,

Financial Statements — Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
Financial Statements

(“SAB 108”). SAB 108 provides interpretive
guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year
misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement.
SAB 108 requires the use of both the “iron curtain” and “rollover” approach in
quantifying the materiality of misstatements. SAB 108 also discusses the
implications of misstatements uncovered upon the application of SAB 108 in
situations when a registrant has historically been using either the iron
curtain approach or the rollover approach. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal
years ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 had no
impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB
issued Statement No. 158,

Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

(“SFAS No.
158”). This new standard aims to make it easier for investors, employees,
retirees and other parties to understand and assess an employer’s financial
position and its ability to fulfill the obligations under its benefit plans. SFAS
No. 158 requires employers to fully recognize in their financial statements the
obligations associated with single-employer defined benefit pension plans,
retiree healthcare plans, and other postretirement plans. Specifically, it
requires a company to (1) recognize on its balance sheet an asset for a plan’s
overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status, (2) measure a
plan’s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the
end of the employer’s fiscal year, and (3) recognize changes in the funded
status of a plan through comprehensive income in the year in which the changes
occur. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 had no impact on our financial position or
results of operations.

In February 2007, the FASB
issued Statement No. 159,

The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

(“SFAS No. 159”).
SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently
required to be measured at fair value. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses
on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in
earnings. The provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are
evaluating

F-41

if we will adopt
SFAS No. 159 and what impact the adoption will have on our
Consolidated Financial Statements if we adopt.

Subsequent Events

On May 11, 2007, Activision
completed its acquisition of DemonWare, the leading provider of network
middleware technologies for console and PC games headquartered in Dublin,
Ireland. The acquisition is expected to enable Activision to gain efficiencies
related to online game development and to position the company to take
advantage of the growth in online gameplay that is expected to be driven by the
next-generation consoles.

On June 8, 2007, with
respect to unexercised options subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue
Code held by employees who are not executive officers, Activision commenced an
offer to amend the exercise price of these options to eliminate the grantee’s
Section 409A tax liability consistent with Internal Revenue Service guidance. Pursuant
to the offer, the Company will also make a cash payment in January 2008 to
employees who accept the offer, in an amount equal to the difference between
the original exercise price of each amended option and the amended exercise
price of each amended option. The offer with respect to all eligible options is
considered a modification of those options for financial reporting
purposes. Pursuant to the accounting standards in effect under SFAS 123R
(revised 2004), the fair value of the modified options (including for this
purpose the cash payments that become payable pursuant to the terms of the
offer) will be recognized as compensation expense over the
remaining requisite service period with the fair value created as a result
of cash payments that become payable pursuant to the terms of the
offer recognized as compensation expense at the expiration of the offer
period on July 6, 2007. In addition, a portion of the compensation costs
associated with the original award may be accelerated and recognized as
compensation expense at the expiration of the offer period as a result of the
cash payment.
