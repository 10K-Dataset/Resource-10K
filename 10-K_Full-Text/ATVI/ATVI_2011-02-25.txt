Item 1.    BUSINESS

Overview

Activision Blizzard is a worldwide online, personal computer ("PC"), console, handheld, and mobile game publisher of interactive
entertainment. Through Activision Publishing, Inc. ("Activision"), we are a leading international publisher of interactive software products and content. Activision develops and publishes video
games on various consoles, handheld platforms and the PC platform through internally developed franchises and license agreements. Activision currently offers games that operate on the Sony Computer
Entertainment Inc. ("Sony") PlayStation 3 ("PS3"), Nintendo Co. Ltd. ("Nintendo") Wii ("Wii"), and Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") Xbox 360 ("Xbox 360") console
systems; Nintendo Dual Screen ("NDS") and Nintendo DSi ("DSi") handheld devices; the PC; the Apple iPhone ("iPhone"), the Apple iPad ("iPad") and other mobile devices. Through Blizzard
Entertainment, Inc. ("Blizzard"), we are the leader in terms of subscriber base and revenues generated in the subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game
("MMORPG") category.



Blizzard
internally develops and publishes PC-based computer games and maintains its proprietary online-game related service, Battle.net.

Our
Activision business involves the development, marketing, and sale of products through retail channels or digital downloads, by license or from our affiliate label program with
certain third-party publishers. Activision is focusing its efforts in the areas we believe have the most opportunity for growth and higher profitability, and we have reduced investments in areas we
believe have less profit potential and limited growth opportunities. Investments are being focused on proven intellectual properties to develop deep, high-quality content that offers
engaging online multiplayer gaming experiences. During 2010, Activision released

Call of Duty: Black-Ops

, which set new interactive
entertainment launch retail sales records with over $650 million of retail sales within five days of launch, exceeding the prior year's record-setting launch of

Call of
Duty: Modern Warfare 2,

according to our internal estimates. The

Call of Duty

franchise has provided players with a sustained
online gaming experience, and has established a large online gaming community. Activision has also recognized that new digital distribution channels have emerged that offer efficiency and convenience
for audiences and additional profit opportunities and recurring revenue models for content creators. As such, Activision is also focused on the delivery of new digital content and online services for
the

Call of Duty

franchise. In addition, Activision is currently developing sequels to build on the continued success of the

Call of Duty

franchise and we
expect to expand the

Call of Duty

franchise into China. Activision also
expects to continue to release several other titles that economically utilize key licensed intellectual properties, such as Marvel's

Spider-Man

and

X-Men

franchises, MGM/Eon's

James
Bond

franchise, Hasbro's

Transformers

franchise and the long-standing

Cabela's

hunting franchise, among others.

While
focusing on our proven intellectual properties, we are also making strategic investments to develop new intellectual property. We have established a long-term alliance
with Bungie, the developer of game franchises including

Halo, Myth

and

Marathon,

to bring Bungie's next
big action
game universe to market. We also expect to release

Skylanders Spyro's Adventure

, an innovative new game that will enable players to transport
real-world toys into the virtual worlds of a video game through the use of "smart toys."

Blizzard
is the development studio and publisher best known as the creator of

World of Warcraft

and the multiple award winning

Diablo

,

StarCraft

, and

World of Warcraft

franchises.
Blizzard distributes its products and generates revenues worldwide through various means, including: subscriptions (which consist of fees from individuals playing

World of
Warcraft,

including sales of prepaid-cards and other value-added service revenues such as realm transfers, faction changes, and other character customizations within

World of Warcraft

gameplay); retail sales of physical "boxed" products; online download sales of PC products; and licensing of software to third-party
or related party companies that distribute

World of Warcraft

and

StarCraft II

. Blizzard has released
three expansion packs to

World of Warcraft

—

World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade

,

World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich
King

, and the third expansion pack,

World of Warcraft: Cataclysm

,
which released in all regions other than China in December 2010. In August 2010, Blizzard released the second

World of Warcraft

expansion pack,

World of Warcraft: Wrath of the
Lich King,

in China. Also, in July 2010, the company launched the sequel to

StarCraft

,

StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty

. In
conjunction with the release of

StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty

, Blizzard launched a new version of its 24/7 online gaming service, Battle.net, facilitating the creation of user
generated content, digital distribution and online social connectivity amongst the

World of Warcraft

and

StarCraft

players. Blizzard is currently
developing a sequel in the

Diablo

franchise,

StarCraft II

's first expansion pack,

Heart of the Swarm

, and a
new massive multiplayer online ("MMO")
game.

Our
distribution business consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistical, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment
software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.



The Company

Activision, Inc. was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. As
described in the explanatory note above, Activision, Inc. consummated a business combination with Vivendi Games during the year ended December 31, 2008 and was renamed Activision
Blizzard, Inc. Activision Blizzard is a public company traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "ATVI."

Our Strategy

Our objective is to continue to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of quality interactive
entertainment software, online content and services that deliver a highly satisfying entertainment experience.

Continue to Improve Profitability.

We continually strive to manage risk and increase our operating leverage and efficiency with the goal
of increased
profitability. We believe the key factors affecting our future profitability will be the success of our core properties, proven franchises and genres, cost discipline, and our ability to leverage the
continued growth of online and digital revenue opportunities.

Create Shareholder Value.

We continue to focus on enhancing shareholder return through growing operating margin, maintaining a strong
balance sheet
and generating strong cash flows. As a result, we expect to continue to achieve long-term growth and have been able to provide value to our shareholders through stock repurchase programs
and cash dividends.

Grow Through Continued Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances.

We intend to continue to evaluate the expansion of our resources and
intellectual
properties library through acquisitions, strategic relationships, and key license transactions. We will also continue to evaluate opportunities to increase our proven development expertise through the
acquisition of, or investment in, selected experienced software development firms.

Focus on Delivery of Digital Content and Online Services.

We continue to shift towards digital delivery of content and to establish and
develop
direct and long-term relationships with our gamers. We will also continue to support, maintain and enhance

World of Warcraft

and

Call of Duty

online
communities. We believe that focusing our efforts on online product innovations, such as additional online content, services and
social connectivity provides lasting value enhancement to our global communities of players.

Competition

We compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other video game companies, as well as with other
providers of different forms of entertainment, such as motion pictures, television, social networking, online casual entertainment and music.

The
interactive entertainment industry is intensely competitive and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly introduced. Our competitors vary in size
from small companies with limited resources to large corporations with greater financial, marketing, and product development resources than we have. Due to their different focuses and allocation of
resources, certain of our competitors may spend more money and time on developing and testing products, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, pay higher
fees to licensors for desirable motion picture, television, sports and character properties, and pay more to third-party software developers. In addition, competitors with large product lines and
popular titles typically have greater leverage with retailers, distributors, and other customers who may be willing to promote titles with less consumer appeal in return for access to such
competitor's most popular titles. We believe that the main competitive factors in the interactive entertainment industry include: product



features,
game quality and playability; brand name recognition; compatibility of products with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; online capability and functionality; ease of use;
price; marketing support; and quality of customer service.

We
compete primarily with other publishers of personal computer, online and video game console interactive entertainment software. In addition to third-party software competitors,
integrated video game console hardware and software companies, such as Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft, compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms. In
addition, certain major media companies, such as Time Warner, Inc., which have been investing in social gaming and video game products, have increased competition within the industry. Further,
a number of software publishers have developed and commercialized, or are currently developing, online games for use by consumers over the Internet, and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge
in the MMORPG category. Lastly, we compete with mobile-game publishers for alternative handheld devices such as Apple's iPhone, Apple's iPad and other emerging mobile devices.

Employees

We had approximately 7,600 total full-time and part-time employees at December 31, 2010. At
December 31, 2010, approximately 138 of our full-time employees were subject to term employment agreements with us. These agreements generally commit the employees to employment
terms of between one and five years from the commencement of their respective agreements. Most of the employees subject to these agreements are executive officers or key members of the product
development, sales, or marketing divisions. These individuals perform services for us as executives, directors, producers, associate producers, computer programmers, game designers, sales directors,
or marketing product managers. In our experience, entering into employment agreements with these employees reduces our turnover during the development, production, and distribution phases of our
entertainment software products and allows us to plan more effectively for future development and marketing activities.

A
small number of our employees in France, Spain and Germany are subject to collective bargaining agreements. To date, we have not experienced any labor-related work stoppages.

Intellectual Property

Like other entertainment companies, our business is significantly based on the creation, acquisition, exploitation and protection of
intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented technology, and other technology and trade secrets that we use to develop our games and to make them
run properly. Other intellectual property is in the form of audio-visual elements that consumers can see, hear and interact with when they are playing our games.

We
develop some of our products from wholly-owned intellectual properties that we create within our own studios. We also acquire the rights to include proprietary intellectual property
in our products through acquisitions. In addition, we obtain intellectual property through licenses and service agreements. These agreements typically limit our use of the licensed rights in products
for specific time periods. In addition, our products that play on game consoles and handheld platforms include technology that is owned by the console or wireless device manufacturer, and licensed
non-exclusively to us for use. We also license technology from providers other than console manufacturers. While we may have renewal rights for some licenses, our business and the
justification for the development of many of our products is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on reasonable terms and at
reasonable rates.

We
actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property. We typically own the copyright to the software code, as well as the brand or title name
trademark under



which
our products are marketed. We register copyrights, trademarks and patents in the United States and other countries as appropriate.

We
often distribute our PC products using copy protection technology or other technological protection measures to prevent piracy and the use of unauthorized copies of our products. In
addition, console manufacturers typically incorporate technological protections and other security measures in their consoles in an effort to prevent the use of unlicensed product. We are actively
engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect against unauthorized copying and piracy, including monitoring online channels for distribution of pirated copies, and participating in various
enforcement initiatives, education programs and legislative activity around the world.

Operating Segments

We operate three operating segments: (i) Activision Publishing, Inc. and its subsidiaries—publishing
interactive entertainment software products and downloadable content which includes studios, assets, and titles previously included in Vivendi Games' Sierra Entertainment operating segment prior to
the Business Combination ("Activision"), (ii) Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries—publishing real-time strategy, role-playing PC games
and online subscription-based games in the MMORPG category ("Blizzard"), and (iii) Activision Blizzard Distribution—distributing interactive entertainment software and hardware
products ("Distribution"). These three operating segments form Activision Blizzard's core operations. Activision Blizzard's non-core exit operations ("Non-Core") represent
legacy Vivendi Games' divisions or business units that we have exited, divested or wound down as part of our restructuring and integration efforts as a result of the Business Combination, but that do
not meet the criteria for separate reporting of discontinued operations. Prior to July 1, 2009, Non-Core activities were managed as a stand-alone operating segment; however, in
light of the minimal activities and insignificance of Non-Core activities, as of that date we ceased their management as a separate operating segment and, consequently, we are no longer
providing separate operating segment disclosure. In accordance with the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") regarding disclosures
about segments of an enterprise and related information, all prior period segment information has been restated to conform to this new segment presentation.

Activision Publishing Segment ("Activision")—Business Overview

Strategy

Create, Acquire, and Maintain Strong Franchises.

Activision focuses on development and publishing activities principally for products
and content
that are, or have the potential to become, franchises with sustainable mass consumer appeal and recognition. It is our experience that these products and content can then serve as the basis for
sequels, prequels, and related new products and content that can be released over an extended period of time. We believe that the publishing and distribution of products and content based on proven
franchises enhances predictability of revenues and the probability of high unit volume sales and operating profits. We own the highly successful intellectual property

Call of
Duty

and intend to continue development of owned franchises in the future. We have entered into a series of strategic relationships with the owners of intellectual properties
pursuant to which we have acquired the rights to publish products based on franchises such as, Hasbro Properties Group ("Hasbro"), MGM Interactive and EON Productions Ltd. ("MGM & EON"),
Mattel, Inc. ("Mattel"), and Marvel Entertainment, Inc. ("Marvel"). We also have an exclusive 10-year alliance with Bungie, a developer of successful game franchises, to
bring Bungie's next big action game universe to market.

Execute Disciplined Product Selection and Development Processes.

The success of our publishing business depends, in significant part,
on our ability
to develop high quality games that will generate high unit volume sales. Our publishing units have implemented a formal control process for the



selection,
development, production, and quality assurance of our products. We apply this process, which we refer to as the "Greenlight Process," to all of our products, whether externally or
internally developed. The Greenlight Process includes in-depth reviews of each project at several important stages of development by a team that includes many of our highest-ranking
operating managers and coordination among our sales, marketing and development staff at each step in the process.

We
develop our products using a combination of our internal development resources and external development resources acting under contract with us. We typically select our external
developers based on their track records and expertise in producing products in the same category. One developer will often produce the same game for multiple platforms and will produce sequels to the
original game. We believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources, which we
believe enhances the quality of our products and timing of releases.

Focused Product Offerings, Diversity in Platforms and Geographies.

We believe Activision has aligned its product offerings and cost
structure to
position the business for long term growth. Through our online-enabled products and content, we believe we are best positioned to take advantage of retail and digital distribution channels that allow
us to deliver content to a diversity of gamers ranging from children to adults and from core gamers and mass-market consumers to "value" buyers, who seek budget-priced software, in a
variety of geographies. Presently, the majority of products that we develop, publish, and distribute operate on the PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii console systems, NDS, DSi, the iPhone, iPad, and the
PC. The emerging and rapidly growing online-enabled platforms, in which we will support in-game integration and bring together online experience and gameplay, will continue to be our
focus. We typically offer our products for use on multiple platforms to reduce the risks associated with any single platform, leverage our costs over a larger installed hardware base, and increase
unit sales. We intend to continue to offer both online and packaged software and games with localized content in different geographies.

Products

In recent years, Activision has been best known for its success in the first-person action category from the

Call of Duty

original
intellectual property, including the latest release,

Call of Duty: Black Ops,

which continues to set sell through records with over $650 million of retail sales during the first five days from launch in November 2010, according to our internal estimates. We plan on
continuing to develop this franchise.

Call of Duty

has achieved approximately $4.2 billion life-to-date revenue and has
an active global community of millions of players.

Call of Duty: Black Ops

, released in the fourth quarter of 2010, is also setting online usage records
that illustrate the game has become one of the leading global entertainment experiences of all time. Activision also develops products spanning other genres, including first person action,
action/adventure, role-playing, simulation and strategy.

In
2011, we expect to continue to build on the success of our

Call of Duty

franchise. In the first quarter of calendar year 2011,
Activision Publishing released

Call of Duty: Black Ops First Strike,

the first add-on map pack for

Call of Duty:
Black

Ops. The map pack launched on Xbox Live on February 1, 2011 and will be available on PS3 and the PC later in the quarter. Activision is also focused on the
delivery of new digital content and online services for the

Call of Duty

franchise. We also expect to introduce

Skylanders
Spyro's Adventure,

an innovative new game that will enable players to transport
real-world toys into the virtual worlds of a video game through the use of "smart toys". Additionally, we expect to release several other titles including two movie-based titles
(

X-Men: First Class

and

Transformers: Dark of the Moon)

and games based on the
best-selling

Spider-Man

franchise, the toy

Bakugan

, the TV shows

Wipe Out

and

Family
Guy

, as well as the long-standing

Cabela's

hunting franchise.



Product Development and Support

Activision develops and produces titles using a model in which a core group of creative, production, and technical professionals, in
coordination with our marketing and finance departments, have responsibility for the entire development and production process including the supervision and coordination of internal and external
resources. This team assembles the necessary creative elements to complete a title using, where appropriate, outside programmers, artists, animators, scriptwriters, musicians and songwriters, sound
effects and special effects experts, and sound and video studios. Activision believes that this model allows us to supplement internal expertise with top quality external resources on an
as-needed basis.

In
addition, Activision often engages independent third-party developers to create products on Activision's behalf. We either own these products or have rights to commercially exploit
these products. In other circumstances, a third-party developer may retain ownership of the intellectual property and/or technology included in the product and reserve certain exploitation rights.
Activision typically selects these independent third-party developers based on their expertise in developing products in a specific category for specific platforms. Each of our third-party developers
is under contract with us, either for a single or multiple titles. From time to time, Activision also acquires the license rights to publish and/or distribute software products that are or will be
independently created by third-party developers.
In such cases, the agreements with these developers provide us with exclusive publishing and/or distribution rights for a specific period of time, often for specified platforms and territories. In
either case, Activision often has the ability to publish and/or distribute sequels, conversions, enhancements, and add-ons to the product initially being produced by the independent
developer and Activision frequently has the right to engage the services of the original developer with regard to the further product development.

In
consideration for the services that independent third-party developers provide the developers receive a royalty, which is generally based on net sales or operating income of the
developed products. Typically, developers also receive an advance, which Activision recoups from the royalties otherwise payable to the developers. The advance generally is paid in "milestone" stages.
The payment at each stage is tied to the completion and delivery of a detailed performance milestone. Working with independent developers allows us to reduce our fixed development costs, share
development risks with the third-party developers, take advantage of the third-party developers' expertise in connection with certain categories of products or certain platforms, and gain access to
proprietary development technologies.

In
April 2010, Activision entered into an exclusive 10-year relationship with Bungie, the developer of game franchises including

Halo,
Myth

and

Marathon,

to bring Bungie's next big action game universe to market. Under the terms of the agreement, Activision will
have exclusive, worldwide rights to publish and distribute all future Bungie games based on the new intellectual property on multiple platforms and devices.

Activision
provides various forms of product support to both our internally and externally developed titles. Activision quality assurance personnel are involved throughout the
development and production of each title published. Activision subjects all such products to extensive testing before release to ensure compatibility with all appropriate hardware systems and
configurations and to minimize the number of bugs and other defects found in the products. To support our products after release, Activision provides its customers online access on a
24-hour basis as well as live telephone operators who answer the help lines during regular business hours.

Marketing, Sales, and Distribution

Activision's marketing efforts include activities on the Internet (including on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other online social
networks and websites), public relations, print and broadcast



advertising,
coordinated in-store and industry promotions (including merchandising and point of purchase displays), participation in cooperative advertising programs, direct response
vehicles, and product sampling through demonstration software distributed through the Internet or the digital online services provided by Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. From time to time, we also
receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers, mass appeal consumer products related to a game, and retailers in connection with their own promotional efforts. In addition, certain of our
products contain software that enables customers to "electronically register" their purchases with us online.

We
believe that our strong proven franchises and genres generate a loyal and devoted customer base that continues to purchase our sequels as a result of their dedication to the franchise
and satisfaction from previous product purchases. We therefore market these sequels, expansion packs and downloadable content toward the established customer base as well as to broader audiences. In
addition, we believe that we derive benefits from our continued marketing of licensed properties, as well as marketing and promotional activities of the intellectual property owners.

North American Sales and Distribution.

Our products are available for sale or rental in thousands of retail outlets in North America.
Our North
American retail customers include, among others, Best Buy, GameStop, Target, Toys "R" Us, and Wal-Mart.

In
the United States ("U.S.") and Canada, our products are sold on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses and game
specialty stores. We believe that a direct relationship with retail accounts results in more effective inventory management, merchandising, and communications than would be possible through indirect
relationships. We have implemented electronic data interchange linkages with many of our retailers to facilitate the placing and shipping of orders. We also sell our products to a limited number of
distributors.

International Sales and Distribution.

Our products are sold internationally on a
direct-to-retail basis, through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements, and through our wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries. We conduct our
international publishing activities through offices in the United Kingdom ("U.K."), Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, Australia and Ireland. We often seek to maximize our
worldwide revenues and profits by releasing high-quality foreign language releases concurrently with English language releases and by continuing to expand the number of direct selling
relationships we maintain with key retailers in major territories.

On
a worldwide basis, our largest customer, GameStop, accounted for approximately 12% of consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. Two of our customers,
GameStop and Wal-Mart, each accounted for approximately 10% and 11% of consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Digital Distribution.

Online and digital distribution channels are emerging rapidly and growing. Some of our products and content are
sold in a
digital format, which allows consumers to purchase and download the content at their convenience directly to their PC, console systems or wireless devices. We partner with digital distributors to
leverage this growing method of distribution. We also make available to our customers value-added downloadable content to enhance their gaming experience through the digital online services provided
by Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo.

Affiliate Labels.

In addition to our own products, we distribute a select number of interactive entertainment products that are
developed and
marketed by other third-party publishers through our "affiliate label" programs in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. The distribution of other publishers' products allows us to
increase the efficiencies of our sales force and provides us with the ability to better ensure adequate shelf presence at retail stores for all of the products that we distribute. Services we provide
under our affiliate label programs include order solicitation, in-store marketing, logistics and order fulfillment, and sales channel management, as well as other accounting and general
administrative functions. Our current affiliate label partners include LucasArts, as well as



several
affiliate label partners in our "value" business, which offers budget-priced software to the public. Each affiliate label relationship is unique and may pertain only to distribution in certain
geographic territories and may be further limited only to a specific title or titles for specific platforms.

Manufacturing

Activision prepares a set of master program copies, documentation, and packaging materials for our products for each hardware platform
on which the product will be released. With respect to products for use on the Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft systems, our disk duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly,
and shipping are performed by third-party subcontractors and Company-owned distribution facilities.

To
maintain protection over their hardware technologies, Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft generally specify or control the manufacturing and assembly of finished products. We deliver the
master materials to the licensor or its approved replicator, which then manufactures finished goods and delivers them to us for distribution under our label. At the time our product unit orders are
filled by the manufacturer, we become responsible for the costs of manufacturing and the applicable per unit royalty on such units, even if the units do not ultimately sell.

Blizzard Entertainment Segment ("Blizzard")—Business Overview

Strategy

Maintain and Build upon Our Leadership Position in the MMORPG Category and PC Online
Categories.

Blizzard plans to maintain and build upon our leadership position in the MMORPG genre by regularly providing new content, game features and online services to
further solidify the loyalty of our subscriber base, as well as to expand our global game footprint to new geographies.

We
believe that the PC online platform will remain a growing category throughout the world. The large and growing PC installed base in all regions and the continuing development of
broadband connectivity facilitates online games and community experiences while creating access to new potential customers. Given the success of

World of
Warcraft

and

StarCraft

in Asia, we expect to continue to be well positioned to capture the growing consumer demand in this
region. Blizzard is among the few companies with video game franchises created and developed in the U.S. that have gained and retained success in Asia with World of Warcraft and StarCraft. Titles in
those series have been among the most
played games in the region for many years. During 2009, Blizzard entered into licensing arrangements for

World of Warcraft

,

StarCraft II

, Battle.net and

Warcraft III

with an affiliated company of NetEase.com, Inc. in
China. Further, as

World of Warcraft

is a server-based game, only playable online, Blizzard is one of the few companies that can target markets that
have been dominated by piracy and monetize former illegitimate players as well as expand in markets that have not been penetrated by consoles, but offer a large PC installed base.

Products

Blizzard is a leading company in the subscription-based MMORPG category.

World of
Warcraft

was initially launched in November 2004 and today is available in North America, Europe (including Russia), Southeast Asia, China, Korea, Australia, New Zealand,
Malaysia, Singapore, Chile, Brazil,



Argentina,
and the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. As of December 31, 2010, more than 12 million gamers worldwide were subscribed* to play Blizzard's

World of Warcraft

.

available
in various languages based on the regions in which it is played and has earned awards and praise from publications around the world. Blizzard launched an expansion pack to

World of Warcraft

,

World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade

, in January 2007 in North America, Europe,
Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand; in South Korea in February 2007; in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau in April 2007; and in China in September 2007. Blizzard launched the second

World of
Warcraft

expansion pack,

World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King,

in November 2008 in all
territories except China, where it launched in August 2010. On December 7, 2010, Blizzard launched the third

World of Warcraft

expansion pack,

World of Warcraft:
Cataclysm

, in all regions in which the game is supported, other than China. Revenues associated with the

World of Warcraft

franchises accounted for 89%, 98%, and 97% of
Blizzard's consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009,
and 2008, respectively.

Additionally,
in July 2010, Blizzard launched the sequel to StarCraft,

StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty

simultaneously around the world,
including in North America, Europe (including Russia), Southeast Asia, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, and the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. In conjunction with the
release of

StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty

, Blizzard launched a new version of its 24/7 online gaming service, Battle.net, providing user generated
content, digital distribution and online social connectivity amongst the

World of Warcraft

and

StarCraft

players. Blizzard is currently developing a sequel in the

Diablo

franchise,

StarCraft II

's first
expansion pack,

Heart of the Swarm

, and a new MMO game.

Product Development and Support

As a development studio, creator and publisher of the

World of Warcraft

,

Diablo

, and

StarCraft

franchises, Blizzard focuses on creating well-designed, high quality
games. Product development is handled internally by a strong core group of talented designers, producers, programmers, artists, and sound engineers. To maintain its current subscribers and attract new
subscribers, Blizzard continues to develop new patches to upgrade

World of Warcraft

. In addition to its headquarters in Irvine, California, Blizzard
maintains offices in or around Austin, Texas; Paris, France; Cork, Ireland; Seoul, South Korea; Singapore; Shanghai, China; and Taipei, Taiwan to provide 24/7 game support to

World of Warcraft

players
in their native language, enhance online community management, and tailor marketing initiatives to specific regions.

Marketing, Sales, and Distribution

Blizzard distributes its products and generates revenues worldwide through various means: subscriptions (which consist of fees from
individuals playing

World of Warcraft

, prepaid cards, and other value-added services such as the ability to change "factions", the ability to transfer
"realms" and other character customizations), retail sales of physical "boxed" product, online download sales of PC products, and licensing of software to third-party or related party companies that
distribute

World of Warcraft

and

StarCraft II

. Many of its services and products are digitally enabled,
which allows us to take advantage of this emerging and rapidly growing channel and to reinforce Blizzard's long-term relationships with its gamers. In addition, Blizzard operates the
online game service, Battle.net, which attracts millions of active players, making it one of the largest online-game related services in the



world.
Battle.net powers Blizzard's

StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty

and

World of Warcraft

, and is
expected to power future releases from Blizzard. The service offers players advanced communications features, social networking, player matching and digital content delivery and is designed to allow
people to connect regardless of what Blizzard game they are playing.

Activision Blizzard Distribution Segment ("Distribution")—Business Overview

We distribute interactive entertainment hardware and software products in Europe through our European distribution subsidiaries:
Centresoft in the U.K. and NBG in Germany. These subsidiaries act as wholesalers in the distribution of products and also provide packaging, logistical and sales services. They provide services to our
publishing operations and to various third-party publishers, including Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft. Centresoft is Sony's preferred distributor of PlayStation products to the independent retail
sector of the U.K.

We
entered into the distribution business to obtain distribution capacity in Europe for our own products, while supporting the distribution infrastructure with third-party sales, and to
diversify our operations in the European market. Centresoft and our other distribution subsidiaries operate in accordance with strict confidentiality procedures to provide independent services to
various third-party publishers.

Item 1A.    RISK FACTORS

We wish to caution the reader that the following important risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those sated in forward-looking statements contained in this document and elsewhere. These risks are not
presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence.

If general economic conditions do not improve, demand for our products could continue to decline.

Our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers. Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary
purchases, including purchases of products like ours, during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. As a result, our products are sensitive to general economic conditions and economic
cycles. In recent years, adverse worldwide economic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, global economic recession, rising unemployment and volatile gasoline prices, have led consumers
to delay or reduce discretionary spending, including purchases of some types of our products. If conditions do not improve, these delays or reductions in purchases may continue. We may also increase
our selling and promotional expenses in an effort to offset reduced consumer spending. A continued reduction or shift in domestic or international consumer spending could negatively impact our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

We depend on a relatively small number of franchises for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.

A significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from products based on a relatively small number of popular
franchises and these products are responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, our top two franchises,

Call of Duty

and

World of Warcraft

, accounted for approximately 62% of our consolidated net revenues, and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income,
in 2010. We expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our revenues and profits. Due to this dependence on a limited number of
franchises, the failure to achieve anticipated results by one or more products based on these franchises may significantly harm our business and financial results.

Our business is "hit" driven. If we do not deliver "hit" titles, or if consumers prefer competing products, our sales could suffer.

While many new products are regularly introduced in our industry, increasingly only a relatively small number of
high-quality "hit" titles account for a significant portion of net revenue, and an even greater portion of net profit. It is difficult to produce high-quality products and to
predict prior to production and distribution what products will be well received, even if they are well-reviewed, high-quality titles. Competitors may develop titles that
imitate or compete with our "hit" titles, and take sales away from them or reduce our ability to command premium prices for those titles. "Hit" products published by our competitors may take a larger
share of consumer spending than anticipated, which could cause our product sales to fall below expectations. Consumers may lose interest in a genre of games we produce. If we do not continue to
develop consistently high-quality and well received products, or if our competitors develop more successful products or offer competitive products at lower prices, our revenues, margins,
and profitability could decline. In addition, our own "hit" products could compete with our other titles, reducing sales for those other titles. Further, a failure by us to develop a
high-quality product, or our development of a product that is otherwise not well received, could harm our reputation and increase the likelihood that our future products will be similarly
poorly received.



The future success of our business depends on our ability to release popular products in a timely manner.

The life of any given console or hand-held game product is relatively short and generally involves a relatively high level
of sales during the first few months after the product's introduction, followed by a rapid decline in sales. Because revenues associated with an initial product launch generally constitute a high
percentage of the total revenues associated with the life of a product, delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have an adverse
effect on our operating results and cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations. It is therefore important for us to be able to continue to develop many high quality new
products that are popularly received and to release those products in a timely manner. If we are unable to continue to do so, our business and financial results may be negatively affected.

Our market is subject to rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our new resources among, emerging technologies, our revenues would
be negatively affected.

Technology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry. We must continually anticipate and adapt our products to emerging
technologies. When we choose to incorporate a new technology into a product or to develop a product for a new platform, operating system or media format, we often are required to make a substantial
investment one to two years prior to the introduction of the product. If we invest in the development of video games incorporating a new technology or for a new platform that does not achieve
significant commercial success, our revenues from those products likely will be lower than we anticipated and may not cover our development costs. If, on the other hand, we elect not to pursue the
development of products incorporating a new technology or for new platforms that achieve significant commercial success, our revenues would also be adversely affected, and it may take significant time
and resources to shift product development resources to that technology or platform. Any such failure to adapt to, and appropriately allocate resources among, emerging technologies would harm our
competitive position, reduce our share and significantly increase the time we take to bring popular products to market.

If we fail to successfully manage our new product development, or if we fail to anticipate the issues associated with such development, our business may suffer.

Our business model is evolving and we believe that our growth will depend upon our ability to successfully develop and sell new types
of products and to otherwise expand the methods by which we reach our consumers, including via digital distribution. Developing new products and distribution channels will require substantial
up-front expenditures. If such products or distribution channels do not achieve expected market acceptance or generate sufficient revenues upon introduction, whether because of competition
or otherwise, we may not be able to
recover the substantial development and marketing costs associated with those products and distribution channels. In addition, expanding our business model will add complexity to our business and
require us to effectively adapt our business and management processes to address the unique challenges and different requirements of any new areas in which we operate, which we may not be able to do,
for lack of institutional expertise or otherwise. If any of these occur, our revenues, margins, and profitability could decline.

Competition within and to the interactive entertainment industry is intense, and competitors may succeed in reducing our sales.

We compete with other publishers of PC and video game console interactive entertainment software. Those competitors vary in size from
small companies with limited resources to very large corporations with significantly greater financial, marketing, and product development resources than we have. For example, integrated video game
console hardware and software companies such as Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms. Further, certain major media
companies, such as the Time Warner, Inc., have



been
investing in video game products and have increased competition within the industry. Our competitors may spend more money and time on developing and testing products, undertake more extensive
marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, pay higher fees to licensors for desirable motion picture, television, sports, music and character properties, pay more to third-party
software developers, or otherwise develop more commercially successful products for the PC or video game platforms than we do. In addition, competitors with large product lines and popular titles
typically have greater leverage with retailers, distributors, and other customers who may be willing to promote titles with less consumer appeal in return for access to those competitors' more popular
titles.

We
also compete with other forms of interactive entertainment, such as casual games like iPhone applications and other mobile phone games, and games developed for use by consumers on the
iPad or social networking sites, most of which are currently free to play. Increased consumer acceptance and increases in the availability of such games or other online games, availability and
consumer acceptance of technology which allows users to play games on televisions without consoles, or technological advances in online game software or the Internet could result in a decline in
platform-based software and negatively impact sales of our console and hand-held products.

Additionally,
we compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities. For example, the overall growth in the use of the Internet and online services such as social
networking sites by consumers may pose a competitive threat if customers and potential customers spend less of their available time using interactive entertainment software and more using the
Internet, including those online services.

We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction actions. Our ability to complete these actions and the impact of such actions on our business may be limited
by a variety of factors. The cost-reduction actions, in turn, may expose us to additional development risk and have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.

A significant portion of our selling and general and administrative expense is comprised of personnel and facilities. We have been
reducing costs by discontinuing the development and publication of titles, closing facilities and reducing our employee population. The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our
revenue and profitability may be influenced by factors including:

•

our ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts, in a manner that is timely enough to offset an immediate
shortfall in revenues and profit, or at all;

•

our ability to generate the level of cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to effectively compete even
if these efforts are successfully completed;

•

decreases in employee morale and the failure to execute upon our business plan due to the loss of employees; and

•

our ability to retain or recruit key employees.

The uncertainty of current worldwide economic conditions makes budgeting and forecasting very difficult.

We are unable to predict the likely duration of the current adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries, and all of the
effects those conditions may have on our business. In particular, the uncertainty of current worldwide economic conditions subjects our forecasts to heightened risks and uncertainties.



Vivendi owns a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock and the interests of Vivendi and its subsidiaries may conflict with the interests of our other
shareholders.

Vivendi and its subsidiaries currently own approximately 61% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock.

As
a result of the Business Combination, Vivendi has the ability to nominate a majority of our board of directors and determine the outcome of certain matters submitted to our
stockholders, such as the approval of significant transactions and the declaration of dividends on our common stock. As a result, actions that may be supported by a majority of stockholders other than
Vivendi may be blocked by Vivendi. In addition, Vivendi's ownership may affect the liquidity in the market for our common stock.

Furthermore,
the ownership position and governance rights of Vivendi may discourage a third party from proposing a change of control or other strategic transaction concerning Activision
Blizzard. As a result, our common stock may trade at prices that do not reflect a "control premium" to the same extent as do the stocks of similarly situated companies that do not have a stockholder
with an ownership interest as large as Vivendi's ownership interest.

We are a "controlled company" within the meaning of NASDAQ rules and, as a result, are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements.

For so long as Vivendi or any other entity or group owns more than 50% of the total voting power of our common shares, we will be a
"controlled company" within the meaning
of NASDAQ rules and, as a result, qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. As a controlled company, we are exempt from several NASDAQ standards, including the
requirements:

•

that a majority of our Board consists of independent directors;

•

that our prospective directors be nominated solely by independent directors; and

•

that the compensation of our executive officers be determined solely by independent directors.

We
currently rely on these exemptions and as a result, a majority of our Board is not independent (as defined by the NASDAQ rules). In addition, while we have a nominating and corporate
governance committee and a compensation committee, these committees do not consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to
stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.

Subject to certain limitations, Vivendi may sell common stock at any time, which could cause our stock price to decrease.

Vivendi may sell the shares of our stock that it owns, including pursuant to a registered underwritten public offering under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act. We have entered into an investor agreement with Vivendi, which includes
registration rights and which gives Vivendi the right to require us to register all or a portion of its shares at any time, subject to certain limitations. The sale of a substantial number of shares
of common stock by Vivendi within a short period of time could cause our stock price to decrease, and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.

Our sales may decline substantially without warning and in a brief period of time because a substantial portion of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key
customers and because we do not have long-term contracts for the sale of our products.

In the U.S. and Canada, Activision has primarily sold its boxed products on a direct basis to mass-market retailers,
consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game specialty stores.



Activision
boxed products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements and through our wholly-owned
European distribution subsidiaries. Activision's sales are made primarily on a purchase order basis without long-term agreements or other forms of commitments. We had one customer,
GameStop, which accounted for approximately 12% of our consolidated net revenues in 2010. We had two customers, GameStop and Wal-Mart, which accounted for 12% and 18% of consolidated gross
receivables at December 31, 2010, respectively. The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any of Activision's principal retail customers or distributors could significantly harm our
business and financial results. The concentration of sales in a small number of large customers also could make us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers becomes
unable to pay for our products or seeks protection under the bankruptcy laws. In addition, having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating
leverage with these customers.

Our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties of international trade.

We conduct business throughout the world, and we derive a substantial amount of revenue from international trade, particularly from
Europe, Asia and Australia. We expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues in the future and, moreover, believe that our growth will
depend on increased sales in emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere.

As
such, we are, and may be increasingly, subject to risks inherent in foreign trade generally, as well as risks inherent in doing business in emerging markets, including increased
tariffs and duties, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, shipping delays, increases in transportation costs, international political, regulatory and economic developments and differing local
business practices, all of which may impact operating margins or make it more difficult, if not impossible, for us to conduct business in foreign markets.

A
deterioration in relations between either us or the U.S. and any country in which we have significant operations or sales, or the implementation of government regulations in such a
country, including China in particular, could result in the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions that harm our business and operating results. For instance, to operate in China,

World of Warcraft, StarCraft
II

and any other game must have regulatory approval. A decision by the Chinese government to revoke its approval for

World of Warcraft

or to decline to approve

StarCraft II

or the

World of
Warcraft: Cataclysm

expansion pack or any other products we desire to sell in China in the future would adversely impact our operating results. Additionally, in the past,
legislation has been implemented in China that has required modifications to the

World of Warcraft

software. The future implementation of similar laws
in China or any other country in which we have operations or sales may require engineering modifications to our products that are not cost-effective, if even feasible at all, or could
degrade the customer experience to the point where customers cease to purchase such products.

We
are also subject to risks that our operations outside the U.S. could be conducted by our employees, contractors, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. While we have policies and procedures intended to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, representatives and
agents may take actions that violate our policies. Moreover, it may be more difficult to oversee the conduct of any such persons who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from
their actions. Any violations of those laws by any of those persons could have a negative impact on our business.

Further,
if government regulations or restrictions prevent us from repatriating internationally derived revenue into the U.S., or a country's tax structure makes repatriation
prohibitively expensive, we may not transfer such revenue into the U.S., which could affect our ability to reinvest or utilize such amounts in our business.



In addition, cultural differences may affect consumer preferences and limit the popularity of titles that are "hits" in the U.S or require us to modify the
content of the games or the method by which we charge our customers for the games in order to be successful. If we do not correctly assess consumer preferences in the countries in our market, our
sales and revenue may be lower than expected.

Our business may be harmed if our distributors, retailers or other parties with which we do business cannot honor their existing credit arrangements, default on their
obligations to us, or seek protection under the bankruptcy laws.

We rely on various business partners for several important aspects of our business, including distribution of our products, product
development and intellectual property licensing. Some of these business partners are highly-leveraged or small businesses that may be particularly vulnerable to difficult economic conditions. As a
result of current economic conditions, we are subject to heightened counterparty risks, including the risks that our business partners may default on their obligations to us or seek protection under
the bankruptcy laws.

For
example, retailers and distributors in the interactive entertainment industry have from time to time experienced significant fluctuations in their businesses and a number of them
have failed. We typically
make sales to most retailers and some distributors on unsecured credit, with terms that vary depending upon the customer's credit history, solvency, credit limits, and sales history, as well as
whether the customer can obtain sufficient credit insurance. Challenging economic conditions may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a result, our
reserves for doubtful accounts and write-off of accounts receivable could increase and, even if increased, may turn out to be insufficient. Moreover, even in cases where we have insolvency
risk insurance to protect against a customer's bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation, this insurance typically contains a significant deductible and co-payment obligation, and does not
cover all instances of non-payment. As a result, a payment default by, or the insolvency or business failure of, a significant customer could significantly harm our business and financial
results.

The
insolvency or business failure of other types of business partners could result in disruptions to the manufacturing or distribution of our products or the cancellation of contractual
arrangements that we consider to be favorable.

The increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model, including greater competition

The proportion of our revenue derived from digital content delivery as compared to traditional retail sales is increasing. This will
also require us to dedicate capital to developing and implementing alternative marking strategies, which we may not do successfully. The increased importance of digital content delivery in the
industry overall increases our potential competition, as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a game delivered digitally may be significantly less than that needed to produce and publish
one that is purchased through retail distribution and is played on a game console. It may also reduce overall demand for our distribution services. If either occurs, our revenues, margins, and
profitability could decline.

We are exposed to seasonality in the sale of our products.

The interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the
year-end holiday buying season. As a result, net revenues, gross profits, and operating income have historically been highest during the second half of the year. Receivables and credit
risk are likewise higher during the second half of the year as customers stock up on our products for the holiday season. Further, delays in development, licensor approvals, or manufacturing can also



affect
the timing of the release of products, causing us to miss key selling periods such as the year-end holiday buying season.

As online functionality has become an increasingly important feature of our software products, we may need to defer the recognition of an increasing amount of revenue, which
may adversely affect the net revenue, net income and earnings per share that we will report under U.S. GAAP in any given period.

As online functionality has become a more important component of gameplay, an increasing number of our online-enabled games contain a
more-than-inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product, and our performance obligations for these games extend beyond the sale of the games.
Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the online services, as we do not plan to separately charge for this component of online-enabled games. As a result, we recognize
revenues from the sale of certain online-enabled games for certain platforms ratably over an estimated service period. In addition, we defer the costs of sales of those titles. If we are required to
recognize a greater portion of the revenue of a sale after shipment, or if we are required to recognize revenue over a longer service period, there may be an adverse effect on our reported net
revenue, net income and earnings per share under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We may permit our customers to return products and to receive pricing concessions which could reduce net revenues and results of operations.

We are exposed to the risk of product returns and price protection with respect to our distributors and retailers. Return policies
allow distributors and retailers to return defective, shelf-worn, damaged and certain other products in accordance with terms granted. Price protection, when granted and applicable, allows
these distributors and retailers a credit against amounts owed with respect to merchandise unsold by them. We may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain
conditions. These conditions may include compliance with applicable payment terms, delivery of weekly inventory and sell-through reports, and consistent participation in the launches of
premium title releases. We may also consider other factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market factors. When we offer price protection, it may be offered
with respect to a particular product to all of our retail customers (although only customers who meet the conditions detailed above are entitled to such price protection). Activision also offers a
90-day limited warranty to its end users that Activision products will be free from manufacturing defects. Although we maintain a reserve for returns and price protection, and although we
may place limits on product returns and price protection, we could be forced to accept substantial product returns and provide substantial price protection to maintain our relationships with retailers
and our access to distribution channels. Product returns and price protection that exceed our reserves could significantly harm our business and financial results.

Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are required to
estimate future taxes. Although we currently believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the estimate process is inherently uncertain, and such estimates are not binding on tax authorities. The
effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the business, including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax elections, and changes in
applicable tax laws, as well as other factors. Further, tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax
provision.

the ultimate tax liability exceed estimates, our income tax provision and net income could be adversely affected.

We
are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes, in both the U.S. and various other
jurisdictions. Tax authorities regularly examine these non-income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations, changes in the business or changes in
applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

The development of quality products requires substantial up-front expenditures, and we may not be able to recover those costs for our future products.

Consumer preferences for games are usually cyclical and difficult to predict, and even the most successful titles remain popular for
only limited periods of time, unless refreshed with new content or otherwise enhanced. In order to remain competitive, we must continuously develop new products or enhancements to existing products.
The amount of lead time and cost involved in the development of quality products is increasing, and the longer the lead time involved in developing a product and the greater the allocation of
financial resources to such product, the more critical it is that we accurately predict consumer demand for such product. If our future products do not achieve expected market acceptance or generate
sufficient revenues upon introduction, we may not be able to recover the substantial development and marketing costs associated with those products, and our financial results could suffer.

A substantial portion of our revenue and profitability depends on the success of our Call of Duty franchise in the first-person action game category. If we do not maintain
our leadership position in this category, our financial results could suffer.

Activision Blizzard is a leading global developer, publisher and distributor in terms of revenues in the first-person action game
category, due to the popularity of Activision's

Call of Duty

franchise. Revenues from this game comprise a significant portion of our consolidated
revenues. To remain a leader in the first-person action game category, it is important that we continue develop new games in the

Call of Duty

franchise
that are favorably received by both our existing customer base and new customers. A number of software publishers have developed and commercialized, or are currently developing, first-person action
games which pose a threat to the popularity of

Call of Duty

, and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge in the first-person action category. If
consumer demand for

Call of Duty

games declines and we have not introduced new first-person action games or other products that replace

Call of Duty's

potentially decreasing revenue, or added other sources of revenue, our financial condition could suffer. Additionally, if consumer
preferences trend away from first-person action games, our revenue and profitability may decline.

A substantial portion of our revenue and profitability depends on the subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game category. If we do not
maintain our leadership position in this category, our financial results could suffer.

Blizzard is the leading global developer, publisher and distributor in terms of subscriber base and revenues in the subscription-based
MMORPG category, due primarily to the popularity of Blizzard's

World of Warcraft

and related expansion packs. Subscription revenues from this game
comprise a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. To remain the leader in the MMORPG category, it is important that we continue to refresh

World of
Warcraft

or develop new MMORPG products that are favorably received by both our existing customer base and new customers. A number of software publishers have developed and
commercialized, or are currently developing, online games for use by consumers over the Internet which pose a threat to the popularity of

World of
Warcraft

, and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge in the MMORPG category. If consumer demand for

World of



Warcraft

games declines and we have not introduced new MMORPG or other products that replace

World of Warcraft

's potentially
decreasing revenue, or added other sources of revenue, our financial condition could suffer. Additionally, if new technologies are developed that replace MMORPG games, consumer preferences trend away
from MMORPG games or new business models emerge that offer online subscriptions for free or at a substantial discount to current MMORPG subscription fees, our revenue and profitability may decline.

A substantial portion of Activision Blizzard's revenues is derived from subscriptions paid by World of Warcraft subscribers. If we are unable to sustain this business model
or these customers cancel their subscriptions, our results of operations may suffer.

A substantial portion of our revenues is generated by subscription fees paid by consumers who play

World of
Warcraft

. Typically,

World of Warcraft

subscribers purchase one to three month memberships that are cancelable, without penalty,
at the end of the membership period. If

World of Warcraft

subscribers become dissatisfied, they may chose not to renew their memberships in order to
engage in other forms of entertainment (including competing MMORPG offerings) and we may not be able to replace lost subscribers. Additionally, if general economic conditions do not improve, consumers
may decrease their discretionary spending on entertainment items such as MMORPG games and users may choose not to renew their

World of Warcraft

subscriptions. A decrease in the overall subscription base of

World of Warcraft

could substantially harm our operating results.

We depend on servers to operate our MMORPG business and other games of ours that have online features. If we were to lose server capacity, for any reason, our business could
suffer.

Our business relies on the continuous operation of our data servers. Any broad-based catastrophic server malfunction, a significant
intrusion by hackers that circumvents our security measures, or a failure of our disaster recovery service would likely interrupt the operation of our MMORPG game,

World of
Warcraft

, and other games of ours with online features and could result in the loss of sales for such games (including subscription-based sales for

World of Warcraft

). An
extended interruption of service could also harm our reputation and operating results.

We
must project our future server needs and make advance purchases of servers to accommodate expected business demands. If we underestimate the amount of server capacity our business
requires or if our business were to grow more quickly than expected, our customers may experience service problems, such as slow or interrupted gaming access. Insufficient server capacity may result
in decreased sales, a loss of our customer base, and adverse consequences to our reputation. Conversely, if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business, we may incur
additional operating costs that would adversely affect our operating margins.

If we do not continue to attract and retain skilled personnel, we will be unable to effectively conduct our business.

Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify, hire, retain and utilize the abilities of qualified personnel,
particularly personnel with the specialized skills needed to create the high-quality "hit" titles upon which our business is substantially dependent. The software industry is characterized
by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors for employees with technical, marketing, sales, product development, and management skills. We may have difficulties in
attracting and retaining skilled personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do so. If we are unable to attract additional qualified employees or retain and utilize the services of key
personnel, our business and financial results could be negatively impacted.



A substantial portion of World of Warcraft's subscribers pays their subscription fees using credit cards. Credit card fraud could have a negative impact on our business and
operating results.

A substantial portion of the subscription revenue generated by

World of Warcraft

is
paid by subscribers using credit cards. At times, there may be attempts to use fraudulently obtained credit card numbers to pay for

World of Warcraft

upgrades or subscriptions. Additionally, the credit card numbers of

World of Warcraft

's subscribers are maintained in a proprietary database that may be
compromised internally or externally. As fraudulent schemes become more sophisticated, it may become more difficult and more costly for us to detect credit card fraud and protect subscriber
information. An increase in credit card fraud could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.

We may not accurately predict the amount of Internet bandwidth necessary to sustain our online gaming businesses.

Our online gaming businesses are dependent on the availability of sufficient Internet bandwidth. An increase in the price of bandwidth
could have an adverse effect on operating margins since we may not be able to increase our prices or subscriber levels to compensate for such costs. Because of the importance of our online business to
our revenues and results of operations, our ability to access adequate bandwidth to support our business is critical. To secure bandwidth access, we have entered into arrangements with several
bandwidth providers and entered into long-term contracts with some of them to secure future bandwidth capacity. If the
price of bandwidth were to decrease, our contractual commitments to pay higher prices could affect our ability to compete with other video game producers.

Conversely,
because we purchase additional bandwidth based on anticipated growth, our bandwidth capacity is sometimes larger than necessary to sustain our existing needs. If our
projected online business growth is delayed or does not occur, we will incur larger bandwidth expenses than necessary. If we underestimate the amount of bandwidth that our online business requires,
and our purchased bandwidth capacity is insufficient to meet demand, our business and reputation may suffer.

The importance to our business of the "smart toys" related to one of our expected new titles will expose us to hardware manufacturing and shipping risks, including
availability of sufficient third-party manufacturing capacity and increases in manufacturing and shipping costs.

A new title we expect to launch in 2011,

Skylanders Spyro's Adventure

, will involve
"smart toys" consisting of action figures and an electronic "portal" which, when used together, will allow a player to store and access information about his character's performance in the game. We
anticipate that many of the manufacturers of those "smart toys" will be located in China. Anything that impacts the ability of those manufacturers to produce or otherwise supply the toys for us or
increases their costs of production, including the utilization of such manufacturer's capacity by another company, changes in safety, environmental or other regulations applicable to the toys and the
manufacturing thereof, natural or manmade disasters that disrupt manufacturing, transportation or communications, labor shortages, civil unrest or issues generally negatively impacting international
companies operating in China, increases in the price of petroleum or other raw materials, increases in fuel prices and other shipping costs, and increases in local labor costs in China, may adversely
impact our ability to supply those toys to the market and the prices we must pay for those toys, and therefore our financial performance. Moreover, the failure of those manufacturers to consistently
deliver action figures and portals meeting the quality and safety standards we require could adversely impact our financial performance.

Sales of one of our expected new titles may be affected by the availability of toys, which will increase our exposure to imbalances between projected and actual demand.

Skylanders Spyro's Adventure

will involve "smart toys" consisting of action figures and
an electronic "portal" which, when used together, will allow a player to store and access information about his



character's
performance in the game. We intend to sell the toys both bundled with the software for the title and on a stand-alone basis. Consumers may not want to buy the related software if they
cannot
also buy the "smart toys". If we underestimate demand or otherwise are unable to produce sufficient quantities of toys of an acceptable quality or allocate too few toys to geographic markets where
demand exceeds supply, we will forego revenue. This may also create greater opportunities for competitors to develop competitive product offerings. In addition, if we overestimate demand and make too
many toys, or allocate too many toys to geographic markets where there is insufficient demand, we will incur unrecoverable manufacturing costs for unsold units as well as for unsold game software. In
either case, toy manufacturing and allocation decisions may negatively affect our financial performance.

If we are unable to successfully develop or market owned intellectual property, we may publish fewer successful titles and our revenues may decline.

Some of our products are based on intellectual property that we have developed internally or acquired from third parties. Consumers
have historically preferred titles which are part of established franchises to titles based on new intellectual property, and if new intellectual property does not gain market acceptance, whether
because we are unable to successfully create consumer appeal and brand recognition or otherwise, our revenues, margins, and profitability could decline. Further, if the popularity of our owned
intellectual property declines, our revenues, margins, and profitability could decline, and we may have to write off the unrecovered portion of the underlying intellectual property assets, any of
which could harm our business and financial results.

If we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to intellectual property, we may publish fewer "hit" titles and revenues may decline.

Some of our products are based on intellectual property and other character or story rights licensed from third parties. These license
and distribution agreements are limited in scope and time, and we may not be able to renew key licenses when they expire or to include new products in existing licenses. Our loss of a significant
number of intellectual property licenses or relationships with licensors, or inability to obtain additional licenses of significant commercial value, could have an adverse effect on our ability to
develop new products and therefore on our business and financial results. Additionally, the failure of intellectual property we license to be, or remain, popularly received could impact the market
acceptance of those products in which the intellectual property is included. Such lack of market acceptance could result in the write-off of the unrecovered portion of acquired
intellectual property assets, which could harm our business and financial results. Furthermore, the competition for these licenses and distribution agreements is often intense. Competition for these
licenses may also increase the advances, guarantees, and royalties that must be paid to the licensor.

We may be subject to intellectual property claims.

As the number of interactive entertainment software products increases and the features and content of these products continue to
overlap, software developers increasingly may become subject to infringement claims. Many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on real world examples, which may be
the subject of intellectual property infringement claims of others. In addition, our products often utilize complex, cutting-edge technology that may become subject to emerging
intellectual property rights of others. Although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others, it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement.
From time to time, we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid or not, may be time consuming, distracting to
management and expensive to defend.



Intellectual
property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:

•

cease selling, incorporating, supporting or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual
property;

•

obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which if available at all, may not be available
on commercially favorable terms;

•

redesign the affected interactive entertainment software products, which could result in additional costs, delay
introduction and possibly reduce commercial appeal of the affected products; or

•

pay damages to the holder of the infringed intellectual property for past infringements.

Any
of these actions may harm our business and financial results.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a negative impact on our results of operations.

We transact business in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar and have significant international sales and expenses denominated
in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, subjecting us to currency exchange rate risks. A substantial portion of our international sales and expenses are denominated in local currencies, including
certain major currencies, such as the euro and U.K. pound, and emerging market currencies, such as the South Korean won and Chinese renminbi, which could fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. We have, in
the past, utilized currency derivative contracts to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures, with hedge tenors of generally less than 12 months, as well as managing these exposures with
natural offsets. We may also, from time to time, hedge non-U.S. dollar earnings. Our principal counterparty in respect of currency derivative contracts is Vivendi, though we periodically
evaluate and may use similar arrangements with other counterparties. There can be no assurance that we will continue these programs, or that we will be successful in managing exposure to currency
exchange rate risks.

We rely on independent third parties to develop some of our software products.

We rely on independent third-party software developers to develop some of our software products. Because we depend on these developers,
we are subject to the following risks:

•

continuing strong demand for top-tier developers' resources, combined with the recognition they receive in
connection with their work, may cause developers who worked for us in the past either to work for a competitor in the future or to renegotiate agreements with us on terms less favorable to us;

•

limited financial resources and business expertise and inability to retain skilled personnel may force developers out of
business prior to completing products or require us to fund additional costs; and

•

a competitor may acquire the businesses of key developers or sign them to exclusive development arrangements. In either
case, we would not be able to continue to engage such developers' services for our products, except for those developers that are contractually obligated to complete development for us.

Increased
competition for skilled third-party software developers also has compelled us to agree to make significant advance payments on royalties to game developers. If the products
subject to these arrangements do not generate sufficient revenues to recover these royalty advances, we would have to write-off unrecovered portions of these payments, which could harm our
business and financial results. Typically, we pay developers a royalty based on a percentage of net revenues from product sales, less agreed upon deductions, but from time to time, we have agreed to
pay developers fixed per unit



product
royalties after royalty advances are fully recouped. To the extent that sales prices of products on which we have agreed to pay a fixed per unit royalty are marked down, our profitability
could be adversely affected.

Our platform licensors set the royalty rates and other fees that must be paid to publish games for their platforms, and therefore have significant influence on our costs.

We pay a licensing fee to the hardware manufacturer for each copy of a product manufactured for that manufacturer's game platform. In
order to publish products for new hardware platforms, we must take a license from the platform licensor which gives the platform licensor the opportunity to set the fee and/or price that we must pay
in order to publish games for that platform. Similarly, the platform licensors have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures and/or pricing for online gameplay and features for their
consoles and the manufacturing of products. The control that platform licensors have over the fee structures and/or pricing for their platforms and online access makes it difficult for us to predict
our costs and profitability in the medium to long term. It is also possible that platform licensors will not renew our existing licenses. Any increase in fee structures and/or pricing, or nonrenewal
of licenses, could have a significant negative impact on our business models and profitability, particularly for Activision, as the publishing of products for console systems is the largest portion of
Activision's business.

Our business is highly dependent on the success, timely release and availability of new video game platforms and on the continued availability of existing video game
platforms, as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured by third
parties, such as Sony's PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii and NDS. For example, sales of products for consoles accounted for 52% of our
consolidated net revenue in 2010. The success of our business is driven in large part by the availability of an adequate supply of these video game platforms, our ability to accurately predict which
platforms will be successful in the marketplace, and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms. We must make product development decisions and commit significant
resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform. A new platform for which we are developing products may be delayed, may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than
anticipated. Alternatively, a platform for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than initially anticipated, causing us to miss a meaningful revenue opportunity.
Additionally, if the platforms for which we are developing products are not released when anticipated, are not available in adequate quantities to meet consumer demand, or do not attain wide market
acceptance, our revenues may suffer, we may be unable to fully recover our investment in developing those products, and our financial performance may be harmed.

Transitions in console platforms could adversely affect the market for interactive entertainment software.

In 2005, Microsoft released the Xbox 360 and, in 2006, Sony and Nintendo introduced the PlayStation 3 and Wii, respectively.
When new console platforms are announced or introduced into the market, consumers typically reduce their purchases of game console entertainment software products for current console platforms in
anticipation of new platforms becoming available. During these periods, sales of game console entertainment software products we publish may slow or even decline until new platforms are introduced and
achieve wide consumer acceptance. This decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new console platforms. As console hardware moves through its life cycle, hardware manufacturers
typically enact price reductions and decreasing prices may put downward pressure on software prices. During platform transitions, we may simultaneously incur costs both in continuing to develop and
market new titles for prior-generation video game



platforms,
which may not sell at premium prices, and also in developing products for current-generation platforms, which will not generate immediate or near-term revenue. As a result, our
operating results during platform transitions may be more volatile and more difficult to predict than during other times, and such volatility may cause greater fluctuations in our stock price.

We must make significant expenditures to develop products for new platforms that may not be successful.

We must make substantial product development and other investments in a particular platform well in advance of introduction of the
platform and may be required to realign our product portfolio and development efforts in response to market changes. Furthermore, development costs for new console platforms are greater than such
costs for current console platforms. If increased costs are not offset by higher revenues and other cost efficiencies, operating results will suffer and our financial position will be harmed. If the
platforms for which we develop new software products or modify existing products do not attain significant market penetration, we may not be able to recover our development costs, which could be
significant, and our business and financial results could be significantly harmed.

If we are unable to sustain launch pricing on current-generation titles, our operating results will suffer.

We expect to be able to price current-generation titles for the Microsoft Xbox 360, Sony's PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Wii at
a premium launch level, but if we are unable to sustain launch pricing on these current-generation titles, whether because retailers elect to price these products at a lower price, due to competitive
pressure or otherwise, we may experience a negative effect on our margins and operating results.

Platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of, and have broad approval rights over, our console and handheld video game products.

Generally, when we develop interactive entertainment software products for hardware platforms offered by Sony, Nintendo, or Microsoft,
the products are manufactured exclusively by that hardware manufacturer or their approved replicator.

The
agreements with these manufacturers include certain provisions, such as approval rights over all software products and related promotional materials and the ability to change the fee
they charge for the manufacturing of products, which allow them substantial influence over the cost and the release schedule of such interactive entertainment software products. In addition, because
each of the manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware platforms and manufactures products for all of its other licensees, a manufacturer may give priority to its own products or
those of our competitors in the event of insufficient manufacturing capacity. Accordingly, Sony, Nintendo, or Microsoft could cause unanticipated delays in the release of our products as well as
increases to projected development, manufacturing, marketing, or distribution costs, which could harm our business and financial results.

In
addition, platform licensors control our ability to provide online game capabilities for console platform products and in large part establish the financial terms and/or pricing on
which these products and services are offered to consumers. Currently, Microsoft provides online capabilities for the Xbox 360, Sony provides online capabilities for PlayStation 3 products, and
Nintendo provides online capabilities for the Wii. In each case, compatibility code and/or the consent of the licensor are required for us to include online capabilities in its console products. As
these capabilities become more significant, the failure or refusal of licensors to approve our products may harm our business and financial results.



We may face difficulty obtaining access to retail shelf space necessary to market and sell our products effectively.

Retailers typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources, and there is intense competition among consumer
interactive entertainment software products for high quality retail shelf space and promotional support from retailers. To the extent that the number of products and platforms increases, competition
for shelf space may intensify and may require us to increase our marketing expenditures. Retailers with limited shelf space typically devote the most and highest quality shelf space to those products
expected to be best sellers. We cannot be certain that our new products will consistently achieve such "best seller" status. Due to increased competition for limited shelf space, retailers and
distributors are in an increasingly better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale, including price discounts, price protection, marketing and display fees, and product return policies. Our
products constitute a relatively small percentage of most retailers' sales volume. We cannot be certain that retailers will continue to purchase our products or to provide those products with adequate
levels of shelf space and promotional support on acceptable terms. A prolonged failure in this regard may significantly harm our business and financial results.

Increased sales of used video game products could lower our sales.

Certain of our larger customers sell used video games, which are generally priced lower than new video games and do not result in any
revenue to the publisher of the games. The market for these games may be growing. Sales of used video games could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse impact on our
operating results.

We may not be able to maintain our distribution relationships with key vendors and customers.

Our NBG and Centresoft subsidiaries distribute interactive entertainment software and hardware products and provide related services in
Germany and the U.K., respectively, and via export in other European countries for a variety of entertainment software publishers, many of which are our competitors, and hardware manufacturers. From
time to time, these subsidiaries also maintain exclusive relationships to serve certain retail customers. These services are generally performed subject to limited-term arrangements.
Although we expect to use reasonable efforts to retain these vendors and retail customer relationships, we may not be successful in this regard. The cancellation or non-renewal of one or
more of these arrangements could adversely affect our business and financial results.

Our products may be subject to legal claims.

In prior years, at least two lawsuits have been filed against numerous video game companies, including against Activision, by the
families of victims who were shot and killed by teenage gunmen in attacks perpetrated at schools. These lawsuits alleged that the video game companies manufactured and/or supplied these teenagers with
violent video games, teaching them how to use a gun and causing them to act out in a violent manner. These lawsuits have been dismissed. Similar additional lawsuits may be filed in the future.
Although our general liability insurance carrier has agreed to defend lawsuits of this nature with respect to the prior lawsuits, it is uncertain whether insurance carriers would do so in the future,
or if such insurance carriers would cover all or any amounts for which we might be liable if such future lawsuits are not decided in our favor. If such future lawsuits are filed and ultimately decided
against us and the relevant insurance carrier does not cover the amounts for which we may be liable, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Payment of significant
claims by insurance carriers may make insurance coverage materially more expensive or unavailable in the future, thereby exposing us to additional risk.



If our products contain defects, our business and reputation could be harmed significantly.

Software products as complex as the ones we publish may contain undetected errors and defects. This risk is often higher when such
products are first introduced or when new versions are released. Failure to avoid, or to timely detect and correct, such errors or defects could result in loss of, or delay in, market acceptance, and
could significantly harm our business, financial results, and reputation.

Our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying, and inadequate intellectual property laws and other protections could prevent us from enforcing or
defending our proprietary technologies. We may also face legal risks arising out of user-generated content.

We regard our software as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and
trade secret laws and employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary rights. We own or license various copyrights, patents, and trademarks. We are aware that some
unauthorized copying occurs, and if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our software products were to occur, it could cause harm to our business and financial results.

Policing
unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and software piracy (including online piracy) is a persistent problem for us,. Further, the laws of some countries where our
products are or may be distributed either do not protect their products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., or are poorly enforced. Legal protection of our
rights may be ineffective in such countries. In addition, though we take steps to make the unauthorized copying and distribution of our products more difficult and to otherwise enforce and police our
rights, as do the manufacturers of consoles on which some of those games (and a majority of those games published by Activision) are played, our efforts and the efforts of the console manufacturers
may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products in all instances. Organized pirate operations have been expanding globally. In addition, the proliferation of technology designed to
circumvent the protection measures used in our products, the availability of broadband access to the Internet, the ability to download pirated copies of games from various Internet sites and
peer-to-peer networks, and the widespread proliferation of Internet cafes using pirated copies of our products all have contributed to an expansion in piracy. This could have a
negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future.

Moreover,
as user-generated content increases, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others may
diminish. We cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in connection with emerging technologies.

Data breaches involving the source code for our products or customer or employee data stored by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues.

We store the source code and game assets for our interactive entertainment software products as created. In addition, we store
confidential information with respect to our customers and employees. A breach of the systems on which such source code and assets, account information (including personally identifiable information)
and other sensitive data is stored could lead to piracy of our software or fraudulent activity resulting in claims and lawsuits against us in connection with data security breaches. A data intrusion
into a server for a game with online features, such as

World of Warcraft

or

Call of Duty

, could also
disrupt the operation of such game. If we are subject to data security breaches, we may have a loss in sales or be forced to pay damages or other amounts, which could adversely affect profitability.
In addition, any damage to our reputation resulting from a data breach could have an adverse impact on our revenues and future growth prospects, or increased costs arising from the implementation of
additional security measures.



Our products are subject to ratings by the Entertainment Software Rating Board and similar agencies. Our failure to obtain our target ratings for our products could
negatively impact our sales.

The Entertainment Software Rating Board (the "ESRB") is a self-regulatory body in the U.S. that provides consumers of
interactive entertainment software with ratings information, including information relating to violence, nudity or sexual content contained in software titles. Certain countries other than the U.S.
have also established similar rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. In some countries, a company may be required to modify its products to comply with the requirements
of the rating systems, which could delay or disrupt the release of any given product, or may prevent its sale altogether in certain territories. The relevant ESRB ratings include "Everyone" (age 6 and
older), "Everyone 10+" (age 10 and older), "Teen" (age 13 and over), or "Mature" (age 17 and over). Certain of our titles have received a "Mature" rating. None of our titles has received the "Adults
Only" rating (18 and over). If we are unable to obtain the ratings we have targeted for our products as a result of changes in the ESRB's ratings standards or for other reasons, including the adoption
of legislation in this area, our business and prospects could be negatively affected.

Our business, products, and distribution are subject to increasing regulation of content in key territories. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our
business may suffer.

Legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the content and the distribution of our products. Those laws and
regulations vary by territory. For example, privacy laws in the U.S. and Europe impose various restrictions on the collection, storage and use of personal information.

In
addition, many foreign countries, such as China and Germany, have laws that permit governmental entities to restrict the content and/or advertising of interactive entertainment
software or prohibit certain types of content. In the U.S, numerous laws have been introduced at one time or another at the federal and state levels which attempt to restrict the content of games or
the distribution of such products.

The
adoption and enforcement of such legislation in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business may harm the sales of our products, as the products we are able to offer to our
customers and the size of the potential market for our products may be limited. We may also be required to modify certain of our product development processes or alter our marketing strategies to
comply with new and possibly inconsistent regulations, which could be costly or delay the release of our products.

Our results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of offensive consumer-posted content.

We are subject to risks associated with the collaborative online features in our games which allow consumers to post narrative comment,
in real time, which is visible to other players. Despite our efforts to restrict inappropriate consumer content, from time to time objectionable and offensive consumer content may be posted to a
gaming or other site with online chat features or game forums which allow consumers to post comments. We may be subject to lawsuits, governmental regulation or restrictions, and consumer backlash
(including decreased sales and harmed reputation), as a result of consumers posting offensive content, any of which could harm our operating results. We may also be subject to consumer backlash from
comments made in response to postings we make on social media sites such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, which could similarly harm our reputation or operating results.

If one or more of our titles were found to contain objectionable undisclosed content, our business could suffer.

Throughout the history of the interactive entertainment industry, many video games have been designed to include certain hidden content
and gameplay features that are accessible through the use of in-game cheat codes or other technological means that are intended to enhance the gameplay experience. However, in some cases,
objectionable undisclosed content or features have been found in our and other publishers' interactive entertainment software products. In a few cases, the ESRB has



reacted
to discoveries of undisclosed content and features in other publisher's products by changing the rating that was originally assigned to the product, requiring the publisher to change the game
and/or game packaging and/or fining the publisher. Retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of such undisclosed content by removing these games from their shelves, refusing to sell them,
and demanding that their publishers accept them as product returns. Likewise, some interactive entertainment software consumers have reacted to the revelation of undisclosed content by refusing to
purchase such games, demanding refunds for games they have already purchased, refraining from buying other games published by the company whose game contained the objectionable material, and, on at
least one occasion, filing a lawsuit against the publisher of the product containing such content.

We
have implemented preventive measures designed to reduce the possibility of objectionable undisclosed content from appearing in the video games we publish. Nonetheless, these
preventive measures are subject to human error, circumvention, overriding, and reasonable resource constraints. If a video game we publish is found to contain undisclosed content, we could be subject
to any of these consequences and our reputation could be harmed, which could have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition, and our business and financial performance could
be significantly harmed.

We engage in strategic transactions and may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses or otherwise realizing the anticipated benefits of the transactions.

As part of our business strategy, we acquire, make investments in and enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures with
complementary businesses from time to time. These transactions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: (A) in the case of an acquisition, (i) the difficulty in
integrating the acquired business and operations in an efficient and effective manner, (ii) any liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition, and (iii) the potential loss of key
employees of the acquired businesses, and, (B) in the case of an investment, alliance or joint venture, our ability to cooperate with our partner. If any such transaction involves an entity
outside of the United States, it may also subject us to the risks and uncertainties of international trade, including the risk that our operations outside the U.S. could be conducted by our employees,
contractors,
representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar anti-bribery laws Further, any such transaction may involve the risk that our senior
management's attention will be excessively diverted from our other operations, the risk that our industry does not evolve as anticipated and that any intellectual property or personnel skills acquired
do not prove to be those needed for our future success, and the risk that our strategic objectives, cost savings or other anticipated benefits are otherwise not achieved. Any of the foregoing could
adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Our involvement in joint ventures decreases our ability to manage risk.

We conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we share control with our joint venture partners. Although we enter
into joint venture arrangements in order to share risks with our joint venture partners, these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk. As with any joint venture arrangement,
differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues. There is the risk that our joint venture partners may at any time
have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. There is also risk that our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we
may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any joint ventures could have
an adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.



We
anticipate entering into additional joint ventures with other entities. We cannot assure that we will undertake such joint ventures or, if undertaken, that such joint ventures will be
successful or produce the anticipated benefits.

Historically, our stock price has been highly volatile.

The trading price of our common stock has been, and could continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors,
including for example, but without limitation:

•

quarter to quarter variations in results of operations;

•

the announcement of new products;

•

the announcement of lower prices on competing products;

•

product development or release schedules;

•

general conditions in the computer, software, entertainment, media or electronics industries, and in the worldwide
economy;

•

timing of the introduction of new platforms and delays in the actual release of new platforms;

•

hardware manufacturers' announcements of price changes for hardware platforms;

•

consumer acceptance of hardware platforms;

•

consumer spending trends;

•

the outcome of lawsuits or regulatory investigations in which we may become involved;

•

changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts;

•

sales or acquisitions of common stock by our directors or executive management, or by Vivendi and its affiliates; and

•

investor perceptions and expectations regarding our products, plans and strategic position, and those of our competitors
and customers.

In
addition, the public stock markets have been experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of
many technology companies for reasons often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.

Our corporate headquarters are located in the Los Angeles, California area, which is near a major earthquake fault. A major earthquake
or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems, or otherwise prevents us from conducting our normal
business operations, could harm our operating results.

Cash Dividends

On February 9, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.165 per common share payable on May 11, 2011
to shareholders of record of the Company's common stock on March 16, 2011. On February 10, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per common share payable on
April 2, 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 22, 2010 and, on April 2, 2010, we made a cash dividend payment to such shareholders. Additionally, on
October 22, 2010, the Company made dividend equivalent payments
related to the 2010 cash dividend to the holders of restricted stock units. We did not pay cash dividends in 2009.

Upon
completion of the Business Combination on July 9, 2008, Vivendi Games returned $79 million of capital to Vivendi and distributed its excess cash on-hand,
as defined in the Business Combination Agreement, of $79 million to Vivendi.

Future
dividends will depend upon our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. There can be no
assurances that dividends will be declared in the future.

Return of capital to Vivendi related to settlement of pre-Business Combination taxes

Prior to the Business Combination, Vivendi Games' income taxes are presented in the financial statements as if Vivendi Games were a
stand-alone taxpayer even though Vivendi Games' operating results are included in the consolidated federal, certain foreign, and state and local income tax returns of Vivendi or Vivendi's
subsidiaries. Based on the subsequent filing of these tax returns by Vivendi or Vivendi's subsidiaries, we determined that the amount paid by Vivendi Games was greater than the actual amount due (and
settled) based upon filing of these returns. This difference between the amount paid and the actual amount due (and settled) represents a return of capital to Vivendi, which was required in accordance
with the terms of the Business Combination agreement immediately prior to the close of the Business Combination.

Stock Splits

In July 2008, the Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of our outstanding common stock effected in
the form of a stock dividend ("the split"). The stock dividend was issued on September 5, 2008 to shareholders of record as of August 25, 2008. The par value of our common stock was
maintained at the pre-split amount of $.000001 per share. The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, including all share and per share data, have been restated as if the
split had occurred as of the earliest period presented.

In
January 2010, we settled a $15 million purchase of 1.3 million shares of our common stock that we had agreed to repurchase in December 2009
pursuant to the stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in 2008 and amended by the Board in 2009 under which we were authorized to repurchase up to $1.25 billion of our
common stock until December 31, 2009. Purchases during the period from February 2010 through December 2010 were made pursuant to the stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of
Directors on February 10, 2010, pursuant to which we were authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in private transactions,
including structured or accelerated transactions, until December 31, 2010. In addition to the repurchases in the table, in January 2011, we settled the purchase of 1.8 million shares of
our common stock at an average price per share of $12.48 for $22 million that we had agreed to repurchase in December 2010 pursuant to that stock repurchase program.

On
February 3, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $1.5 billion of the Company's common stock from
time to time on the open market or in private transactions, including structured or accelerated transactions, on terms and conditions to be determined by the Company, until the earlier of
March 31, 2012 and a determination by the Board of Directors to discontinue the repurchase program.

Item 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

Item 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Business Overview

Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a worldwide online, personal computer ("PC"), console, handheld, and mobile game publisher of
interactive entertainment. The terms "Activision Blizzard," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Based upon our
organizational structure, we conduct our business through three operating segments as follows:

Activision Publishing, Inc.

Activision Publishing, Inc. ("Activision") is a leading international publisher of interactive software products and
downloadable content. Activision develops and publishes video games on various consoles, handheld platforms and the PC platform through internally developed franchises and license agreements.
Activision currently offers games that operate on the Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. ("Sony") PlayStation 3 ("PS3"), Nintendo Co. Ltd. ("Nintendo") Wii ("Wii"), and Microsoft
Corporation ("Microsoft") Xbox 360 ("Xbox 360") console systems; Nintendo Dual Screen ("NDS") and Nintendo DSi ("DSi") handheld devices; the PC; the Apple iPhone ("iPhone"), the Apple
iPad ("iPad") and other mobile devices. Our Activision business involves the development, marketing, and sale of products through retail channels or digital downloads, by license, or from our
affiliate label program with certain third-party publishers.

Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.

Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. ("Blizzard") is a leader in terms of subscriber base and revenues generated in the
subscription-based massively multi-player online role-playing game ("MMORPG") category. Blizzard internally develops and publishes PC-based computer games and maintains its
proprietary online-game related service, Battle.net. Our Blizzard business involves the development, marketing, sales and support of role playing action and strategy games. Blizzard also
develops, hosts, and supports its online subscription-based games in the MMORPG category. Blizzard is the development studio and publisher best known as the creator of

World of
Warcraft

and the multiple award winning

Diablo

,

StarCraft

, and

World of Warcraft

franchises. Blizzard distributes its products and generates revenues worldwide through various means, including: subscription revenues
(which consist of fees from individuals playing

World of Warcraft

, prepaid cards and other value-added service revenues such as realm transfers, faction
changes, and other character customizations within the

World of Warcraft

gameplay); retail sales of physical "boxed" products; online download sales of
PC products; and licensing of software to third-party or related party companies that distribute

World of Warcraft

and

StarCraft
II

.

Activision Blizzard Distribution

Activision Blizzard Distribution ("Distribution") consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistical, and sales
distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Business Combination

On July 9, 2008, a business combination (the "Business Combination") by and among Activision, Inc., Sego Merger
Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Activision, Inc., Vivendi S.A. ("Vivendi"), VGAC LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi, and Vivendi Games, Inc. ("Vivendi
Games"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of VGAC LLC, was consummated. As a result of the



consummation
of the Business Combination, Activision, Inc. was renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc. For accounting purposes, the Business Combination is treated as a "reverse acquisition,"
with Vivendi Games deemed to be the acquirer. The historical financial statements of Activision Blizzard, Inc. prior to July 10, 2008 are those of Vivendi Games.

Activision Blizzard's Non-Core Exit Operations

Activision Blizzard's non-core exit operations ("Other" or "Non-Core") represent legacy Vivendi Games'
divisions or business units that we have exited, divested or wound down as part of our restructuring and integration efforts as a result of the Business Combination described above, but that do not
meet the criteria for separate reporting of discontinued operations. Prior to July 1, 2009, Non-Core activities were managed as a stand-alone operating segment; however, in light of
the minimal activities and insignificance of Non-Core activities, as of that date we ceased their management as a separate operating segment. Consequently, we are no longer providing
separate operating segment disclosure and have reclassified our prior periods' segment presentation so that it conforms to the current period's presentation.

Key Industry Dynamics

Overall, the installed base of current-generation console systems and handheld devices has continued to significantly expand. As of
December 2010, according to The NPD Group with respect to North America and Charttrack and Gfk with respect to Europe, the installed base of current generation console systems and handhelds devices
grew to 267 million units, an increase of 50 million units or 23% from December 2009. Additionally, the online-enabled consoles (the
Microsoft Xbox 360 and the Sony PS 3) grew to 74 million units at December 2010, an increase of 19 million units, or 35%, year-over-year.

Further,
according to the same sources for North America and Europe, for the year ended December 31, 2010, retail sales of software for high-definition online-enabled
platforms (Microsoft Xbox 360, Sony PS 3, and the PC) experienced an increase of 13% versus prior year, while software sales for the Wii and handheld devices were collectively down by 24%,
resulting in an overall decrease in retail software sales of 7%.

The
sales of highly-rated core games with online functionality, such as

Call of Duty: Black Ops

, have continued to trend upwards and have
gained share. According to the same information sources, first-person action genres increased retail share by 29% in 2010 as compared to 2009 in North America and Europe, collectively. On the other
hand, considerable weakness in casual consumer titles, particularly in the music and casual genres, which declined in 2010, compared to 2009, was reflected in the decline in the retail sales of
software for the Wii and handheld devices.

Notably,
digital distribution channels continue to experience significant growth and are estimated to be up approximately 14% over prior year for North America and Europe, based on our
internal estimates. We also estimate that increasing revenues from the digital channel helped to offset weakness at retail, resulting in a total decrease of only 3%
year-over-year for the industry. We include downloadable games and content, massively multiplayer online subscriptions and value-added services, and mobile and social games in
our estimates of revenues from this digital channel.

Business Results and Highlights

Notwithstanding the above-mentioned industry dynamics, Activision Blizzard's overall results were strong in 2010. Consolidated net
revenues were $4.447 billion, and consolidated net income was $418 million, which included a $326 million non-cash pre-tax charge from the impairment of
finite-lived intangible assets reflecting the impact of the weaker sales in the casual and music genres. The



Company
grew revenues, operating income, operating margin and earnings per share as compared to the same period in 2009 and generated $1.376 billion in net cash from operating activities for
2010.

Also,
according to The NPD Group with respect to North America and Charttrack and Gfk for Europe and Activision Blizzard internal estimates, as applicable, during
2010:

•

Activision Blizzard was the #1 publisher in North America and Europe, collectively;

•

Activision Blizzard was the #1 publisher in North America on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC, collectively;

•

Activision's

Call of Duty: Black Ops

was the #1 title overall and has
achieved more than $1 billion in retail sales worldwide;

•

Blizzard Entertainment's

World of Warcraft: Cataclysm

, which was launched
on December 7, 2010, sold through more than 3.3 million copies worldwide to consumers during its first 24 hours of release, making it the fastest-selling PC game of all time and
sold through more than 4.7 million copies in its first month of release; and

•

In North America and Europe, Activision Blizzard had three of the top five PC titles:

StarCraft
II, World of Warcraft: Cataclysm

and

Call of Duty: Black Ops

.

In
addition, during the December quarter, in North America and Europe

, Call of Duty: Black Ops

was the #1 best-selling console
title in revenues and the

Call of Duty

franchise was the #1 franchise overall according to The NPD Group with respect to North America and
Charttrack and Gfk with respect to Europe.

In
April 2010, Bungie, a developer of successful game franchises, and Activision announced an exclusive 10-year alliance to bring Bungie's next big action game universe to
market.

On
February 3, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock until the earlier
of March 31, 2012 and a determination by the Board of Directors to discontinue the repurchase program.

On
February 9, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.165 per common share to be paid on May 11, 2011 to shareholders of record at the close of
business on March 16, 2011.

. The map pack launched on Xbox Live on February 1, 2011 and will be available on PS3 and the PC later in the
quarter.

International Operations

International sales are a fundamental part of our business. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 46%, 48%,
and 50% of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We maintain significant operations in the United States, Canada, the United
Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Australia, Sweden, South Korea, Norway, Denmark, China, and the Netherlands. We believe that it is important to develop content locally that is specifically
directed toward local cultures and customs to succeed internationally. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign
currency exchange rate volatility. Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Management's Overview of Business Trends

Online Content and Digital Downloads

We provide our products through both the retail channel and through digital online delivery methods. Many of our video games that are
available through retailers as packaged software products such as DVDs are also available by direct digital download through the Internet (both from websites that we own and from others owned by third
parties). We also offer downloadable content and add-ons to our products (

e.g.

, new multi-player map packs and additional songs). Digital
online-delivered content is generally offered to consumers for a one-time fee. Our subscription based services are digitally delivered and hosted by Blizzard Entertainment's proprietary
online gaming service, Battle.net. Digital revenues have become
an increasingly important part of our business and we continue to focus on and grow them. For 2010 compared to 2009, our sales through digital channels grew year-over-year.

Current Generation of Game Consoles

The current generation of game consoles began with Microsoft's launch of the Xbox 360 in 2005, and continued in 2006 when Sony
and Nintendo launched the PS3 and the Wii, respectively. We have seen a significant decline in PS2 revenues during 2010 and 2009 as compared to 2008, suggesting that this prior-generation platform is
very close to being completely replaced by the current generation of consoles. Overall console sales remained strong in 2010, with an installed base of hardware in the U.S. and Europe of
267 million units as of December 31, 2010, representing an increase of 23% in units year-over-year, according to The NPD Group, with respect to the U.S., and
Charttrack and Gfk, with respect to Europe. The installed base of PS3 and Xbox 360 hardware units increased 35% year-over-year, while the installed base of Wii hardware
units increased only 24% year-over-year. We will continue to monitor game console sales to manage our product delivery on each platform in a manner we believe to be most
effective.



Concentration of Top Titles

The concentration of retail revenues among key core titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive software industry.
According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 23% of the sales in the U.S. video game industry in 2010, as compared to 21% in 2009. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues has
historically been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games are responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, our two key
franchises of

Call of Duty

and

World of Warcraft

, accounted for over 62% of our net revenues, and a
significantly higher percentage of our operating income, in 2010. We expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our revenues
and profits.

Seasonality

The interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal. We have historically experienced our highest sales volume in the
year-end holiday buying season, which occurs in the fourth quarter, and our lowest sales volume in the second quarter of our calendar year. We defer the recognition of a significant amount
of net revenue related to our software titles containing online functionality that constitutes a more-than-inconsequential separate service deliverable over an extended period
of time (i.e., typically six months to less than a year). As a result, the quarter in which we generate the highest sales volume may be different than the quarter in which we recognize the
highest amount of net revenue. Our results can also vary based on a number of factors, including title release dates, consumer demand for our products, market conditions and shipment schedules.

Focused Product Offering and Restructuring Plan

Driven by a desire to improve operating margin by focusing Activision's resources on titles it believes have the best potential for
success and the anticipation of a continuing weak environment for casual and music-based games, we will be implementing a restructuring plan involving a focus on the development and publication of a
reduced slate of titles on a going-forward basis. Specifically, we will be disbanding our Guitar Hero business unit and discontinuing the development of all music-based games, including the Guitar
Hero title we had previously planned for 2011. In addition, we decided to discontinue development on

True Crime: Hong Kong

due to the concentration of
competitive titles in that genre. The restructuring plan will also involve a re-alignment of our cost structure to correspond to our more focused product slate and a related reduction in
studio headcount and corporate overhead. The reduction will result in the separation of approximately 500 employees.

As
a result of this shift in our focus, in 2011, we expect fewer overall releases but a more focused slate than in the past two years. As such, we expect our top line net revenues to be
down year-over-year, primarily due to lower revenues from products with low-to-no profitability. In addition, since Blizzard had two major releases in
2010 and has not yet announced a launch date for its next global release, we are currently assuming two fewer titles from Blizzard in 2011 and, accordingly, lower revenues.

Operating Segment Results

Our operating segments are consistent with our internal organizational structure, the manner in which our operations are reviewed and
managed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), the manner in which operating performance is assessed and resources are allocated, and the availability of
separate financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments.

The
CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of the impact of the change in deferred net revenues and related cost of sales with respect to certain of our online-enabled games,
stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expense, amortization of intangible assets and purchase price accounting related adjustments, impairment of intangible assets, integration and
transaction costs, and other*. Information on the operating segments and reconciliations of total segment net revenues and

Non-Core activities, which are legacy Vivendi Games' divisions or business units that we have exited, divested or wound down as part of
our restructuring and integration efforts as a result of the Business Combination. Prior to July 1, 2009, Non-Core activities were managed as a stand-alone operating segment;
however, in light of the minimal activities and insignificance of Non-Core activities, as of that date we ceased their management as a separate operating segment and consequently, we are
no longer providing separate operating segment disclosure and have reclassified our prior periods' segment presentation so that it conforms to the current period's presentation.

Note

—The historical financial statements prior to July 10, 2008 are those of Vivendi Games only. The financial information of the businesses
operated by Activision, Inc. prior to the Business Combination is included from the date of the Business Combination (i.e. from July 10, 2008 onwards), but not for prior periods.
We also provide a discussion and analysis of the operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 in the Supplemental Pro Forma Information section



below
as the pro forma basis provides greater comparability for the Activision and Distribution segments as the Supplemental Pro Forma Information reflects pre-Business Combination
businesses previously operated by Activision, Inc. The Blizzard segment is not affected by any of the pro forma adjustments.

For
better understanding of the differences in presentation between our segment results and the consolidated results, the following explains the nature of each reconciling item.

Net Effect from Deferral of Net Revenues and Related Cost of Sales

We have determined that some of our game's online functionality represents an essential component of gameplay and as a result a
more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable. As such, we are required to recognize the revenues of these game titles over the estimated service periods. The product life may
range from a minimum of five months to a maximum of less than a year. The related cost of sales is deferred and recognized to match revenues. In the table above, we present the amount of net revenues
and related cost of sales separately for each period as a result of the accounting treatment.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense

We expense our stock-based awards using the grant date fair value over the vesting periods of the stock awards. In the case of
liability awards, the liability is subject to revaluation based on the then-current stock price. Included within stock-based compensation are the net effects of capitalization, deferral,
and amortization. The stock-based compensation expenses for each period are presented above.

Restructuring

We implemented an organizational restructuring plan in the third quarter of 2008 as a result of the Business Combination. The
restructuring activities included severance costs, facility exit costs, write offs of assets and liabilities and exit costs from the cancellation of projects. On June 30, 2009, we had completed
the majority of our organizational restructuring activities as a result of the Business Combination and do not expect any material costs relating to this item going forward as we have completed these
restructuring activities.

However,
on February 3, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new restructuring plan expected to be implemented in the quarter ending March 31, 2011,
resulting in a net pretax charge in the first two quarters of 2011, which is expected to total between $35 and $50 million, comprised of severance costs, the costs of other separation benefits
and other exit costs. This represents a subsequent event that occurs after the balance sheet date.

Amortization of Intangible Assets and Purchase Price Accounting Related Adjustments

All of our intangible assets are the result of the Business Combination and other acquisitions. We amortize the intangible assets over
their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of consumption of the underlying economic benefits. The amount presented in the table represents the effect of the amortization of intangible assets
as well as other purchase price accounting adjustments, where applicable, in our consolidated statements of operations.

Impairment of Intangible Assets

We recorded a non-cash impairment charge on finite-lived intangible assets of $326 million and $409 million
for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, reflecting a continuing weaker environment for the casual game and music genres.



Integration and Transaction Costs

These costs were incurred to effect the Business Combination and included activities such as merging systems and streamlining the
business processes of the combined company of Activision Blizzard. We do not expect any further costs relating to this item going forward as we have completed our integration and transaction
activities.

Segment Net Revenues

Activision

Activision's
net revenues decreased for 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to the following:

•

Release of fewer key titles in 2010 than in 2009 and weaker sales of games in the music and casual genres. In 2010,
Activision released twelve key titles compared to the release of sixteen key titles in 2009; and

•

Blur

and

Singularity

, two
new intellectual properties that were released in the second quarter of 2010, had only limited market success. While establishing successful new intellectual properties has always been difficult, the
economic environment made it particularly challenging in 2010.

The
decreases were partially offset by the:

•

Strong performance from

Call of Duty: Black Ops,

which was released in the
fourth quarter of 2010;

•

Continued strong performance of

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,

which was
released in November 2009;

•

Launch of the

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Stimulus Package

map pack on
Microsoft Xbox Live ("XBLive") in the first quarter of 2010 and on PlayStation Network ("PSN") in the second quarter of 2010; and

•

Launch of the

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Resurgence

map pack on XBLive
in the second quarter of 2010 and on PSN in the third quarter of 2010.

For
2009, net revenues from the Activision segment increased as compared to 2008 primarily due to the following:

•

As a result of the consummation of the Business Combination, net revenues of $685 million from the Activision
businesses operated by Activision, Inc. for the six months ended June 30, 2009 were included in 2009, but not in 2008;

•

Launches of two new intellectual properties,

DJ Hero

and

PROTOTYPE

in 2009; and

•

Strong performance from

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2

, which was released
in November 2009.

These
were partially offset by weaker performance of the

Guitar Hero

franchise in 2009 versus 2008.

Blizzard

Blizzard's
net revenues increased for 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily as a result of the release of

World of Warcraft:
Cataclysm

in the fourth quarter of 2010 and

StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty

in the third quarter of 2010. The increase in net
revenues also reflects growth in sales of value-added services related to

World of Warcraft

, which consist of transactions such as realm transfers,
faction changes, and other character customizations within the

World of Warcraft

gameplay. The China region business was also back online for the full
year of 2010 and Blizzard successfully launched

World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King

in China in August 2010.



Blizzard's
net revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to no new releases in 2009 and an interruption of

World of Warcraft

in China from June 2009 to
September 2009 as a result of a license transfer. This compared to 2008 with the successful November 2008
release of the second expansion pack of

World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King

. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in other
value-added service revenues.

Distribution

Distribution's
net revenues decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to weakness in the interactive software industry in the United Kingdom
("U.K.") resulting in lower sales from U.K. independent retailers and warehousing services.

The
increase in Distribution net revenues for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to the consummation of Business Combination in which net revenues of $148 million from the
Distribution businesses operated by Activision, Inc. for the six months ended June 30, 2009 were included in the year ended December 31, 2009, but not in 2008.

Segment Income from Operations

Activision

Activision's
operating income decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to the following:

•

Release of fewer key titles in 2010 than in 2009 and weaker sales of games in the music and casual genres;

•

Limited market success of two new intellectual properties,

Blur

and

Singularity

;
and

•

Higher inventory obsolescence of peripherals and write offs as a result of cancellations of certain titles
(

e.g.,

a Guitar Hero title that had been planned for release in 2011 and

True Crime: Hong Kong

).

These
negative impacts on operating income were partially offset by:

•

Stronger performance from our

Call of Duty

franchise in both retail and
digital channels;

•

A positive shift in the sales mix to higher-margin digital products;

•

Lower sales and marketing expenses as a result of fewer releases; and

•

Savings realized from headcount reductions within certain administrative functions in the first quarter of 2010.

Activision's
operating income increased in 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily due to the following:

•

The increase in revenues from Activision as noted previously; and

•

Lower operating expenses stemming from continuing effective cost-containment strategies.

Blizzard

Blizzard's
operating income increased for 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to:

•

Release of

World of Warcraft: Cataclysm

in the fourth quarter of 2010 and

StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty

in the third quarter of 2010;

•

Increase in sales of value-added services related to

World of Warcraft

;
and



•

The China region business being back online for full year of 2010 and the successful launch of

World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King

in China in
August 2010.

Blizzard's
operating income for 2009 decreased as compared to 2008, primarily as a result of the following:

•

The decrease in net revenues noted previously; and

•

Incremental investments made by Blizzard for customer service and for product development for the sequel to

StarCraft

, the next

World of Warcraft

expansion pack, and enhancing Battle.net.

Supplemental Pro Forma Operating Segment Results

The consummation of the Business Combination has resulted in the businesses operated by Activision, Inc. prior to the Business
Combination being included from the date of the Business Combination (i.e. from July 9, 2008 onwards), but not for prior periods. Therefore, for comparability purposes, we combined
Activision, Inc.'s financial information with Activision Blizzard's reported financial information in the following table to create pro forma Activision Blizzard financial information for the
year ended December 31, 2008. This pro forma information is for informational purposes only and does not reflect any operating efficiencies or inefficiencies which may have resulted from the
Business Combination and therefore is not necessarily indicative of results that would have been achieved had the business been combined during the years presented. We have included a reconciliation
between the reported consolidated and segment financial information to the pro forma consolidated and segment financial information. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further details of our segment presentation.

On
a pro forma operating segment basis, our operating margin for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was 29%, 26% and 24%, respectively. Highlights and analysis of
our individual segment net revenues and income from operations are as follows:

Pro forma Activision Segment Net Revenues

Activision's net revenues decreased for 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to the:

•

Release of fewer key titles in 2010 than in 2009 and weaker sales of games in the music and casual genres; and

•

Limited market success of the two new intellectual properties,

Blur

and

Singularity.

These
negative impacts on net revenues were partially offset by the:

•

Strong performance from

Call of Duty: Black Ops,

which was released in the
fourth quarter of 2010; and

•

Continued strong performance of

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2

in retail
and its related digital downloadable content.

Activision's
net revenues decreased for 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily due to:

•

The weakness in the economy adversely impacting the casual game and music genres and the weaker performance of the

Guitar Hero

franchise in 2009 as
compared to 2008; and

•

The decline in sales of PS2 platform titles due to the aging lifecycle of the PS2 platform as consumers transitioned to
current-generation platforms.

Partially
offsetting these negative impacts on net revenues were the:

•

Increase in net revenues from the strong performance of

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare

; and

•

Growth in online digital revenues from

Call of Duty

downloadable content.

Pro Forma Activision Segment Income from Operations

Activision's operating income decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to the:

•

Release of fewer key titles in 2010 than in 2009 and weaker sales of games in the music and casual genres;

•

Limited market success of

Blur

and

Singularity

; and

•

Higher inventory obsolescence of peripherals and write-offs resulting from the cancellations of certain titles
in development.

These
negative impacts to operating income were partially offset by:

•

Stronger performance from our

Call of Duty

franchise in both retail and
digital channels;

•

A positive shift in the sales mix of higher-margin products;

•

Lower sales and marketing expenses as a result of fewer releases; and

•

Savings realized from headcount reductions within certain administrative functions in the first quarter of 2010.



Activision's operating income increased in 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily due to:

•

Strong performance of

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2

, which was released
in November 2009;

•

The change in business mix, with fewer sales of hardware peripherals and accordingly lower product costs;

•

Launches of two new intellectual properties,

DJ Hero

and

PROTOTYPE

in 2009;

•

Growth in higher margin online digital revenues; and

•

Lower operating expenses stemming from continuing effective cost-containment strategies.

These
factors were partially offset by the decrease in net revenues described above.

Schedules of Reconciliation of Reported Consolidated and Segment Financial Information to Pro Forma Consolidated and Segment Financial Information for the Year Ended
December 31, 2008

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the pro forma consolidated financial information below is comprised of
Activision, Inc.'s financial information for the period January 1, 2008 to July 9, 2008 together with Activision Blizzard's reported financial information for the year ended
December 31, 2008. Activision, Inc.'s financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and June 30, 2008 are extracted from the quarterly information which
has not been audited. Activision, Inc.'s financial information from July 1, 2008 to July 9, 2008 has not been audited. In conjunction with the Business Combination, senior
management changed the manner in which they assess the operating performance of, and allocate resources to, our operating segments during the year ended December 31, 2008.

Consolidated
net revenues increased in North America and Asia Pacific in 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to the success of the

Call of
Duty

franchise, particularly the release of

Call of Duty: Black Ops

in the fourth quarter of 2010 and continued strong
performance of

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2

during the year and the release of

World of Warcraft:
Cataclysm

and

StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty

in the fourth and third quarters of 2010, respectively, as well as higher



revenues
from sales of

World of Warcraft's

value-added services. The increase in consolidated net revenues in Asia Pacific was also attributable to the
China region business being back online for the full year of 2010 and its continued growth with the successful launch of

World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich
King

in China in August 2010. The increase in consolidated net revenues for North America was partially offset by the impact of fewer titles released in 2010 and the weaker
sales of games in the music and casual genres. Consolidated net revenues for Europe decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange effects and the greater
impact on the decrease in sales of games in the music and casual genres. The decrease was partially offset by the strong performance of the

Call of Duty

franchise in Europe, the release of

World of Warcraft: Cataclysm

and

StarCraft II

and continued growth
in

World of Warcraft's

value-added services.

The
greater success of

Call of Duty: Black Ops

sales at initial launch compared to

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare

sales at initial launch is the primary reason that less revenue was deferred during 2010 as compared to 2009. This decrease in deferred revenue was partially offset by the
additional deferral of revenue as a result of the release of

World of Warcraft: Cataclysm

and value-added services in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Consolidated
net revenues increased in all regions in 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily due to the post-Business Combination net revenues consisting of $690 million
in North America, $507 million in Europe and $54 million in Asia Pacific from the businesses previously operated by Activision, Inc. for the six month period ended June 30,
2009 that were included in 2009 but not in 2008. The increase in North America, which was further driven by the strong performance of the Call of Duty franchise, in particular the 2009 release of

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare

. The increase was partially offset by the impact of weaker sales of games in the music and casual genres in 2009.

Foreign Exchange Impact

Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of approximately $54 million and $71 million on Activision
Blizzard's net revenues in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The change is primarily due to the year-over-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and
euros.

Net
revenues from MMORPG decreased slightly in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily as a result of lower deferred and boxed revenue recognized in 2010 due to the timing of expansion pack
releases by Blizzard. While the

World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King

expansion pack launched in the fourth quarter of 2008 resulted in significant
deferred revenues that were recognized in 2009, the

World of Warcraft: Cataclysm

expansion pack launched in the fourth quarter of 2010, resulted in a
lower percentage of deferred revenue recognized in 2010, with the majority of deferred revenues to be recognized in 2011. This decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher revenues from sales of

World of
Warcraft

's value-added services. Net revenues from PC and other increased in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily as a result of the release of

StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty.

Net
revenues from Sony PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Xbox 360 increased in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily as a
result of the success of the

Call of Duty

franchise, in particular, the strength of

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare

and its associated map packs in downloadable content digital formats, and the strong consumer demand for

Call of Duty: Black
Ops.

Sony PlayStation 2 platform revenues continued to decline due to fewer titles published on this platform given the aging lifecycle of the Sony PlayStation 2 platform as
consumers are now almost fully transitioned to the current-generation platforms. Net revenues from Nintendo Wii decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to the weakness in the sales in
casual and music genres. Net revenues from handheld devices decreased for the same period primarily as a result of alternative handheld devices such as Apple's iPhone, Apple's iPad and other mobile
devices, as well as general weakness in the casual titles.

Regarding
deferred revenues by platform, additional revenues were deferred in 2010 across MMORPG, PC and other, Sony PlayStation 3 and the Microsoft Xbox 360 platforms driven by
the successful releases of

World of Warcraft: Cataclysm

,

StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty

and

Call of Duty: Black Ops

.

MMORPG
net revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of the continued growth of the

World of Warcraft

franchise and online
value-added services. Net revenues from various consoles and handheld platforms increased, except for PS2, in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily as a result of the consummation of the Business
Combination. The increases in net revenues by platform in 2009 were also driven by the success of our

Call of Duty

franchise, in particular,

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare

, on the Xbox360 and PS3 platforms. Partially offsetting the increase was the weaker sales of casual games and games in
the music genre as compared to the core games genre, which includes titles from the

Call of Duty

franchise. The weaker sales in the casual games and
music genres were due to extended economic weakness and competition from emerging platforms, such as the iPhone and other community internet applications that accommodate gameplay. PS2 platform
revenues declined due to the fewer titles published on this platform given aging lifecycle of the PS2 platform as consumers transitioned to the current-generation platforms.

Software royalties and amortization







(10

)


Intellectual property licenses







(118

)


Total cost of sales decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to:

•

The change in business mix for products with fewer hardware peripherals, and accordingly lower product costs;

•

A greater share of revenues generated by the Blizzard segment, which has a lower overall cost of sales; and

•

Lower intellectual property license expenses due to weaker sales of games in the music and casual games genres, selling
more of our owned titles rather than affiliated titles and the decrease in amortization of intangible assets.

These
decreases in cost of sales were partially offset by:

•

The stronger performance of the

Call of Duty

franchise and the release of

StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty

and

World of Warcraft: Cataclysm

and the resulting increase in product
costs;

•

More deferred costs recognized consistent with more deferred revenues recognized, during 2010 as compared to 2009;

•

Higher inventory obsolescence charges relating to peripherals; and

•

Costs related to our continued focus on customer service for our

World of
Warcraft

subscribers.

Total
cost of sales increased in 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily due to:

•

Post-Business Combination product costs of $530 million, software royalties and amortization of
$151 million, and intellectual property licenses of $112 million from businesses previously operated by Activision, Inc., for the six month period ended June 30, 2009 that
were included in 2009, but not in 2008; and

•

Incremental investments made by Blizzard for improved levels of customer service.

These
factors were partially offset by a change in business mix with lower cost of sales resulting from our shift to selling more software versus hardware, and selling more of our owned
titles than affiliated titles.

For 2010, product development costs increased as compared to 2009, mainly due to the write off of capitalized software development costs of
cancelled titles, primarily a Guitar Hero title that had been planned for 2011 and

True Crime: Hong Kong

. This increase in product development expense
was partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense and the benefits realized from headcount reductions at certain Activision studios, primarily in the first quarter of 2010, to align the
Company's resources with its product slate.

For
2009, product development costs increased as compared to 2008, primarily due to post-Business Combination product development costs of $143 million from businesses
previously operated by Activision, Inc., for the six month period ended June 30, 2009 that were included in 2009, but not in 2008. This increase in product development expense was
partially offset by the complete wind down of Non-Core operations, resulting in lower product development expense from Non-Core operations in 2009 as compared to 2008. Product
development costs in 2008 included the write off of capitalized software development costs of cancelled titles in the amount of $71 million as a result of the rationalization of our title
portfolio after the Business Combination.

Sales and marketing expenses decreased in 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, primarily as a result of a reduction in the number of major

Call of Duty

and

World of Warcraft

franchises, and the launch of

StarCraft II:
Wings of Liberty

.

For
2009, sales and marketing expense increased as compared to 2008, primarily due to post-Business Combination sales and marketing expenses of $147 million from
businesses previously operated by Activision, Inc., for the six month period ended June 30, 2009 that were included in 2009, but not in 2008. This increase was partially offset by a

General and administrative expenses decreased in 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to:

Favorable foreign exchange effects; and



•

Lower stock-based compensation expense.

These
factors were partially offset by higher accrued bonuses and legal expenses.

For
2009, general and administrative expenses increased as compared to 2008, primarily due to:

•

Post-Business Combination general and administrative expenses of $114 million from businesses
previously operated by Activision, Inc., for the six month period ended June 30, 2009 that were included in 2009, but not in 2008;

•

Increases in stock-based compensation expense; and

•

Foreign exchange losses from revaluation of our transaction exposures.

These
factors were partially offset by benefits from the cost-containment strategy we implemented and synergies resulting from our restructuring efforts from the Business

In the fourth quarter of 2010, as a result of the franchise and industry results of the holiday season, we significantly revised our outlook for
the retail sales of software. With the impact of the continued economic downturn on our industry in 2010 and the change in the buying habits of casual consumers, we reassessed our overall
expectations. We considered these economic changes during our 2011 planning process that was conducted during the months of November and December, which resulted in a strategy change to, among other
things, focus on fewer title releases in the casual and music genres. As a result, we updated our future projected revenue streams for our franchises in the casual and music genres. We performed
recoverability and, where applicable, impairment tests on the related intangible assets in accordance with ASC Subtopic 360-10. Based on the analysis performed, we recorded impairment
charges of $67 million, $9 million and $250 million to license agreements, game engines and internally developed franchises intangible assets, respectively, for 2010 within our
Activision segment. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information
regarding the determination of the impairment charges recorded for the year ended December 31, 2010.

In
the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded impairment charges of $24 million, $12 million and $373 million to license agreements, game engines and internally
developed franchises intangible assets, respectively, for 2009 within our Activision segment.

In the third quarter of 2008, we implemented an organizational restructuring as a result of the Business Combination. This organizational
restructuring was to integrate different operations and to streamline the combined Activision Blizzard organization. The implementation of the organizational restructuring resulted in restructuring
charges, including severance costs; contract termination costs;



fixed
asset write-off on disposals; impairment charges on acquired trade names, prepaid royalties, intellectual property licenses; impairment charges on goodwill; and loss on disposal of
assets/liabilities. At June 30, 2009, we had completed the majority of our organizational restructuring activities as a result of the Business Combination. See Note 8 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detail and a rollforward of the restructuring liability that includes the
beginning and ending liability, costs incurred, cash payments and non cash write downs.

Investment and other income, net increased in 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, primarily as a result of a reduction in fair value of a

Investment

The income tax expense of $74 million in 2010 reflects an effective tax rate of 15%. The effective tax rate of 15% for 2010 differs from
the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to foreign income taxes provided at lower rates, a beneficial geographic mix in profitability, recognition of Federal and California research and development
credits and IRC 199 domestic production deductions. The federal research credit was reinstated in December 2010 for tax years January 1, 2010- December 31, 2011.

For
2010, our effective tax rate of 15% differs from the effective tax rate for 2009, primarily due to the loss from the impairment of intangible assets which resulted in a book tax
benefit at the U.S. statutory rate and the release of valuation allowances on net operating losses deductions which provided additional benefit on both a book and taxable income basis for 2009. For
2008, the tax benefit as a result of net income (loss) before income taxes was offset by tax benefits from net operating losses surrendered and the release of valuation allowances.

tax liabilities, and payments to our workforce. Cash flows used in investing activities reflect that we purchased short-term investments totaling $800 million, made capital
expenditures of $97 million primarily for property and equipment, and received $580 million upon the maturity of investments, the majority of which consisted of our U.S. treasuries and
government agency securities during the year ended December 31, 2010. Cash flows used in financing activities primarily reflect our repurchase of 85 million shares of our common stock
for an aggregate purchase price of $959 million under the stock repurchase program and payment of a cash dividend of $189 million to shareholders of our common stock, partially offset by
$73 million of proceeds from issuance of shares of common stock to employees pursuant to stock option exercises.

In
addition to cash flows provided by operating activities, our primary source of liquidity was $3.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments at
December 31, 2010. With our cash and cash equivalents and expected cash flows provided by operating activities, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet daily operations in the
foreseeable future. We also believe that we have sufficient working capital (approximately $2.5 billion at December 31, 2010) to finance our operational requirements for at least the
next twelve months, including purchases of inventory and equipment, the funding of the development, production, marketing and sale of new products, to finance the acquisition of intellectual property
rights for future products from third parties, to fund a new stock repurchase program and to pay the dividends declared on February 9 to our shareholders.

On
April 29, 2008, Activision, Inc. entered into a senior unsecured credit agreement with Vivendi, as lender, which provided for a revolving credit facility of up to
$475 million. Borrowings under the agreement became available upon consummation of the Business Combination. Effective July 23, 2010, we terminated that agreement.

On
November 5, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (the "2008-2009 Stock Repurchase Program") under which we were
authorized to repurchase



up
to $1 billion of our common stock until October 30, 2009. On July 31, 2009, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of $250 million to the 2008-2009
Stock Repurchase Program, bringing the total authorization to $1.25 billion, and extended the expiration date of the
2008-2009 Stock Repurchase Program until December 31, 2009. During 2009, we repurchased 114 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of
$1,235 million pursuant to the 2008-2009 Stock Repurchase Program. In January 2010, we settled a $15 million purchase of 1.3 million shares of our common stock that we
had agreed to repurchase in December 2009 pursuant to the 2008-2009 Stock Repurchase Program, completing the 2008-2009 Stock Repurchase Program.

On
February 10, 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program (the "2010 Stock Repurchase Program") under which we were authorized to
repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock until December 31, 2010. During 2010, we repurchased 84 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of
$944 million pursuant to the 2010 Stock Repurchase Program. In January 2011, we settled a $22 million purchase of 1.8 million shares of our common stock that we had agreed to
repurchase in December 2010 pursuant to the 2010 Stock Repurchase Program.

On
February 3, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock, on terms and
conditions to be determined by the Company, until the earlier of March 31, 2012 and a determination by the Board of Directors to discontinue the repurchase program.

On
February 10, 2010, Activision Blizzard's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per common share payable on April 2, 2010 to shareholders of record at the
close of business on February 22, 2010. On April 2, 2010, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $187 million to such shareholders. On October 22, 2010, the Company
made dividend equivalent payments of $2 million related to this cash dividend to the holders of restricted stock units.

Additionally,
on February 9, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.165 per common share payable on May 11, 2011 to shareholders of record at the close
of business on March 16, 2011.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

The primary drivers of cash flows from operating activities have typically included the collection of customer receivables generated by
the sale of our products and our subscription revenues, offset by payments for taxes and payments to vendors for the manufacture, distribution and marketing of our products, to third-party developers
and intellectual property holders, and to our workforce. A significant operating use of our cash relates to our continued investment in software development and intellectual property licenses. We
expect that we will continue to make significant expenditures relating to our investment in software development and intellectual property licenses.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

The primary drivers of cash flows used in investing activities have typically included capital expenditures, acquisitions and the net
effect of purchases and sales/maturities of short-term investments. During 2010, we purchased short-term investments totaling $800 million, made capital expenditures of
$97 million, primarily for property and equipment, and received $580 million upon the maturity of investments.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

The primary drivers of cash flows used in financing activities have historically related to transactions involving our common stock,
including the issuance of shares of common stock to



employees
and the public and the purchase of treasury shares. We have not utilized debt financing as a source of cash flows.

In
2010, cash flows used in financing activities included $959 million used to purchase Activision Blizzard stock under the stock repurchase programs described above.

Capital Expenditures

We made capital expenditure of $97 million in 2010. In 2011, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately
$100 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be primarily for computer hardware and software purchases and various corporate projects.

Commitments

In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third-parties for non-cancelable operating
lease agreements for our offices, for the development of products, and for the rights to intellectual property ("IP"). Under these agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor,
developer or intellectual property holder, as the case may be, based upon contractual arrangements. The payments to third-party developers are generally conditioned upon the achievement by the
developers of contractually specified development milestones. Further, these payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders typically are deemed to be advances and are recoupable
against future royalties earned by the developer or intellectual property holder based on the sale of the related game. Additionally, in connection with certain intellectual property rights
acquisitions and development agreements, we commit to spend specified amounts for marketing support for the related game(s) which is to be developed or in which the intellectual property will be
utilized. Assuming all contractual provisions are met, the total future minimum commitments for these and other contractual arrangements in place at December 31, 2010 are scheduled to be paid
as follows (amounts in millions):

We
have omitted uncertain income tax liabilities from this table due to the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of potential issue resolution.
Specifically, either the underlying positions have not been fully enough developed under audit to quantify at this time or the years relating to the issues for certain jurisdictions are not currently
under audit. At December 31, 2010, we had $132 million of unrecognized tax benefits.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
parties, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance



sheet
arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operation, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Financial Disclosure

We maintain internal control over financial reporting, which generally includes those controls relating to the preparation of our
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). We also are focused on our "disclosure controls and procedures,"
which as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") are generally those controls and procedures designed to ensure that financial and non-financial information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC is reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is communicated to management, including our
principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our
Disclosure Committee, which operates under the Board-approved Disclosure Committee Charter and Disclosure Controls & Procedures Policy, includes senior management
representatives and assists executive management in its oversight of the accuracy and timeliness of our disclosures, as well as in implementing and evaluating our overall disclosure process. As part
of our disclosure process, senior finance and operational representatives from all of our corporate divisions and business units prepare quarterly reports regarding their current quarter operational
performance, future trends, subsequent events, internal controls, changes in internal controls and other accounting and disclosure relevant information. These quarterly reports are reviewed by certain
key corporate finance executives. These corporate finance representatives also conduct quarterly interviews on a rotating basis with the preparers of selected quarterly reports. The results of the
quarterly reports and related interviews are reviewed by the Disclosure Committee. Finance representatives also conduct reviews with our senior management team, our legal counsel and other appropriate
personnel involved in the disclosure process, as appropriate. Additionally, senior finance and operational representatives provide internal certifications regarding the accuracy of information they
provide that is utilized in the preparation of our periodic public reports filed with the SEC. Financial results and other financial information also
are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. As required by applicable regulatory requirements, the principal executive and financial officers review and make
various certifications regarding the accuracy of our periodic public reports filed with the SEC, our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting. With the
assistance of the Disclosure Committee, we will continue to assess and monitor, and make refinements to, our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. The estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are both important to the
portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on
estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs.



Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers and
once any
performance obligations have been completed. Certain products are sold to customers with a street date (

i.e.,

the earliest date these products
may be sold by retailers). For these products we recognize revenue on the later of the street date or the sale date. Revenue from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance
for returns and price protection.

For
our software products with online functionality, we evaluate whether those features or functionality are more than an inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software
product. This evaluation is performed for each software product and any online transaction, such as an electronic download of a title with product add-ons, when it is released. Determining
whether the online service for a particular game constitutes more than an inconsequential deliverable, as well as the
estimated service periods and product life over which to recognize the revenue and related costs of sales, are subjective and require management's judgment.

When
we determine that a software title contains online functionality that constitutes a more-than-inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the
product, principally because of its importance to gameplay, we consider that our performance obligations for this title extend beyond the sale of the game. Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
value does not exist for the online functionality, as we do not separately charge for this component of the title. As a result, we recognize all of the software-related revenue from the sale of the
title ratably over the estimated service period, which is estimated to begin the month after either the sale date or the street date of the title, whichever is later. In addition, we initially defer
the costs of sales for the title (excluding intangible asset amortization), and recognize the costs of sales as the related revenues are recognized. Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs,
software royalties and amortization, and intellectual property licenses.

We
recognize

World of Warcraft

boxed product, expansion packs and other value-added service revenues each with the related subscription
service revenue ratably over the estimated service periods beginning upon activation of the software and delivery of the services. Revenues attributed to the sale of

World of
Warcraft

boxed software and related expansion packs are classified as product sales and revenues attributable to subscription and other value-added services are classified as
subscription, licensing and other revenues.

Revenue
for software products with more than inconsequential separate service deliverables and

World of Warcraft

products are recognized
over the estimated service periods, which range from a minimum of five months to a maximum of less than a year.

For
our software products with features we consider to be incidental to the overall product offering and an inconsequential deliverable, such as products which provide limited online
features at no additional cost to the consumer, we recognize the related revenue from them upon the transfer of title and risk of loss of the product to our customer.

Allowances for Returns, Price Protection, Doubtful Accounts, and Inventory Obsolescence.

We may permit product returns from, or grant
price
protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the circumstances in which we elect to decrease the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and,
when granted and applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers must meet to be granted the
right to return products or price protection include, among other things, compliance with applicable trading and payment terms, and consistent return of inventory and delivery of
sell-through reports to us. We may also consider other factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market factors. Management must make estimates of
potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product revenue. We estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for current period product revenue
utilizing historical



experience
and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer. The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and
price protection for a particular title: historical performance of titles in similar genres; historical performance of the hardware platform; historical performance of the franchise; console hardware
life cycle; sales force and retail customer feedback; industry pricing; weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory; absolute quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory; our
warehouse on-hand inventory levels; the title's recent sell-through history (if available); marketing trade programs; and performance of competing titles. The relative
importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other items, genre, platform, seasonality, and sales strategy. Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and
used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period. Based upon historical experience, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. However,
actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a number of reasons including, among others, a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the
same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor, or technological obsolescence due to the emergence of new hardware platforms. Material differences in the amount and timing of our revenue for
any period may result if factors or market conditions change or if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in determining the allowances for returns and price protection.
For example, a 1% change in our December 31, 2010 allowance for sales returns, price protection and other allowances would impact net revenues by approximately $4 million.

Similarly,
management must make estimates as to the collectability of our accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze the age of current
outstanding account balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes in our customers' payment terms and their economic
condition, as well as whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance. Any significant changes in any of these criteria would affect management's estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful
accounts.

We
regularly review inventory quantities on-hand and in the retail channel. We write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future
anticipated demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of
the inventory and net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, which are inherently difficult to assess. At the point of a loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that
inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established basis.

Software Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses.

Software development costs include payments made to independent software
developers
under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for internally developed products.

We
account for software development costs in accordance with the FASB guidance for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed ("ASC Subtopic
985-20"). Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility
of a product encompasses both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and tested product design and working model. Significant management judgments and estimates
are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Technological feasibility
is evaluated on a product-by-product basis. Prior to a product's release, we expense, as part of "cost of sales—software royalties and amortization," capitalized
costs if and when we believe such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized costs for those products that are cancelled or expected to be abandoned are charged to product development expense in the
period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to product development expense.



Commencing
upon product release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "cost of sales—software royalties and amortization" based on the ratio of current
revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months or less.

Intellectual
property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks, copyrights, software, technology, music, or other
intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our products. Depending upon the agreement with the rights holder, we may obtain the rights to use acquired intellectual property in
multiple products over multiple years, or alternatively, for a single product. Prior to the related product's release, we expense, as part of "cost of sales—intellectual property
licenses," capitalized intellectual property costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized intellectual property costs for
those products that are cancelled or expected to be abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation.

Commencing
upon the related product's release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to "cost of sales—intellectual property licenses" based on the
ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed property will be utilized. As intellectual property license contracts may extend
for multiple years, the amortization of capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year.

We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior
periods, the primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance
of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed trademark or copyright is to be used. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance
of comparable products developed with comparable technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and, for any sequel product, estimated performance based on the performance of the product on
which the sequel is based. Further, as many of our capitalized intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized
intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors, such as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property, whether there are any
future planned theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property, and the rights holder's continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property.

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the
assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the original
forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge.
Material differences may result in the amount and timing of charges for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in evaluating these qualitative factors.

Income Taxes.

We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with
FASB income
tax guidance ("ASC Topic 740"), the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.



Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies,
together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are
determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. The calculation of tax liabilities
involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of ASC Topic 740 and other complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with
management's expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.

Fair Value Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP often requires us to determine the fair value of a
particular item to fairly present our Consolidated Financial Statements. Without an independent market or another representative transaction, determining the fair value of a particular item requires
us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting.

There
are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value. These include (1) the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or
liabilities are used to determine the fair value, (2) the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, future cash flows or future earnings) to a
single present amount, and (3) the cost approach, which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset. For many of our fair value estimates, including our estimates of the
fair value of acquired intangible assets, we use the income approach. Using the income approach requires the use of financial models, which require us to make various estimates including, but not
limited to (1) the potential future cash flows for the asset, liability or equity instrument being measured, (2) the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows,
(3) the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows, and (4) the inherent risk associated with the cash flows (risk premium). Making these cash
flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective, and, if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate, our financial results may be
negatively impacted. Furthermore, relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related
accounting conclusion reached. For example, a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired. While we are required to make
certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions, the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments:

Business Combinations.

We must estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Our
assessment of the
estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives. Furthermore, a change in the estimated fair value of an
asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill, which is an asset that is not amortized. Often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed
requires an assessment of expected use of the asset, the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired
in-process technology. Such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements.

Assessment of Impairment of Assets.

Management evaluates the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived
assets in accordance with FASB literature related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets within ASC Subtopic 360-10, which generally requires the
assessment of these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists. We considered certain events and circumstances in determining whether



the
carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable including, but not limited to: significant changes in performance relative to
expected operating results; significant changes in the use of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and
changes in our
business strategy. In determining whether an impairment exists, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets. If an impairment is
indicated based on a comparison of the assets' carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets.

During
2010, we recorded an impairment charge of $326 million to our finite-lived intangible assets. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the determination of the impairment charges recorded for the year ended December 31,
2010.

FASB
literature related to the accounting for goodwill and other intangibles within ASC Topic 350 requires a two-step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each
reporting unit. Our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which both (1) discrete financial information is available and
(2) segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. ASC Topic 350 requires that the impairment test be performed at least annually by applying a
fair-value-based test. The first step measures for impairment by applying fair-value-based tests at the reporting unit level. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount
of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit.

To
determine the fair values of the reporting units used in the first step, we use a discounted cash flow approach. Each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of
significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include long-term growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows,
risk-adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. These estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting
unit evaluated for impairment. Our estimates for market growth, our market share and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, and are based on
assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. If future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require future impairment charges. We
base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.

Stock-Based Compensation.

We estimate the value of stock-based payment awards on the measurement date using a binomial-lattice model.
Our
determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly
complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option
exercise behaviors.

For
a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an update to

Revenue
Recognition—Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

. This update establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple
revenue-generating activities. This update



provides
amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables, measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. The amendments in this update also establish a
selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. Significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor's multiple-deliverable revenue
arrangements, including information about the nature and terms, significant deliverables, and its performance within arrangements. The amendments also require providing information about the
significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling-price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition. The amendments in this
update are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The adoption of this update on
January 1, 2011 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
October 2009, the FASB issued an update to

Software—Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements

. This
update changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are "essential to the functionality," and excludes these products from the
scope of current software revenue guidance. The new guidance will include factors to help companies determine which software elements are considered "essential to the functionality." The amendments
will now subject software-enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements, such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple-deliverables. The amendments in this
update are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The adoption of this update on
January 1, 2011 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposures primarily include
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We transact business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatility is monitored throughout the year. To mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate exposure resulting from our foreign currency denominated monetary
assets, liabilities and earnings, we periodically enter into currency derivative contracts, principally swaps and forward contracts with maturities of twelve months or less. Vivendi is our principal
counterparty and the risks of counterparty non-performance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material. We expect to continue to use economic hedge programs in the
future to reduce foreign exchange-related volatility if it is determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk. We do not hold or purchase any foreign currency contracts for
trading or speculative purposes. All foreign currency economic hedging transactions are backed, in amount and by maturity, by an identified economic underlying item. Our foreign exchange forward
contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in
our consolidated balance sheets, and the associated gains and losses from changes in fair value are reported in investment and other income, net and general and administrative expense in the
consolidated statements of operations.

The
gross notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange swaps was $138 million and $120 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. A pre-tax
net unrealized gain of less than a million and an unrealized loss of $2 million for the years ended 2010 and 2009, respectively, resulted



from
the foreign exchange contracts and swaps with Vivendi and were recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.

Revenues
and related expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in their respective local currencies. Primary currencies include euros, British
pounds, Australian dollars,
South Korean won, and Swedish krona. The consolidated statements of operations are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates indicative of market rates during each applicable period. To the
extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency-denominated transactions results in reduced revenues, operating expenses, and net income from
our international operations. Similarly, our revenues, operating expenses, and net income will increase for our international operations if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies. From
time to time, we hedge our foreign currency translation risk by entering into foreign exchange contracts with Vivendi. We recognized a realized loss of $2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010 from the settlement of the hedging foreign exchange contracts and there was no outstanding foreign exchange contract hedging translation risk as of December 31, 2010.
As of December 31, 2010, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10% would have resulted potential declines in our net income of approximately $70 million. This
sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; however, all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and
actual results may differ materially.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We do not use derivative
financial instruments to manage interest rate risk in our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average
maturities and money market funds that invest in AAA-rated government-backed securities. Because short-term securities mature relatively quickly and must be reinvested at the
then current market rates, interest income on a portfolio consisting of cash, cash equivalents or short-term securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer
term securities. Conversely, the fair value of such a portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term securities. At December 31, 2010, our
$2.81 billion of cash and cash equivalents was comprised primarily of money market funds. At December 31, 2010, our $696 million of short-term investments included
$672 million of U.S. treasury and government-sponsored agency debt securities, and $24 million of restricted cash. We also had $23 million in auction rate securities at fair value
classified as long-term investments at December 31, 2010. Most of our investment portfolio is invested in short-term or variable rate securities. The Company has
determined that, based on our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2010, there was no material interest rate risk exposure to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows as of that date.

Item 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

Item 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Definition and Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that it will detect or uncover
failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. Inherent limitations to any system of disclosure controls and procedures
include, but are not limited to, the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of such controls by one or more persons. In addition, we have designed our system of controls based
on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, and our system of controls may therefore not achieve its desired objectives under all possible future
events.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures at December 31, 2010, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, at December 31, 2010, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis, and
(ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of December 31, 2010, of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report included in this annual report on Form 10-K.



Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Activision Blizzard, Inc.:

In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows, present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement Schedule II Valuation and Qualifying Accounts presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial
statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement
schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Description of Business

Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a worldwide online, personal computer ("PC"), console, handheld, and mobile game publisher of
interactive entertainment. The terms "Activision Blizzard," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Based upon our
current organizational structure, we operate three operating segments as follows:

(i) Activision Publishing, Inc.

Activision Publishing, Inc. ("Activision") is a leading international publisher of interactive software products and content.
Activision develops and publishes video games on various consoles, handheld platforms and the PC platform through internally developed franchises and license agreements. Activision currently offers
games that operate on the Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. ("Sony") PlayStation 3 ("PS3"), Nintendo Co. Ltd. ("Nintendo") Wii ("Wii"), and Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft")
Xbox 360 ("Xbox 360") console systems; the Nintendo Dual Screen ("NDS") and
Nintendo DSi ("DSi") handheld devices; the PC; the Apple iPhone ("iPhone"), the Apple iPad ("iPad") and other mobile devices. Our Activision business involves the development, marketing, and sale of
products through retail channels or digital downloads, by license, or from our affiliate label program with certain third-party publishers.

(ii) Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.

Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. ("Blizzard") is a leader in terms of subscriber base and revenues generated in the
subscription-based massively multi-player online role-playing game ("MMORPG") category. Blizzard internally develops and publishes PC-based computer games and maintains its
proprietary online-game related service, Battle.net. Our Blizzard business involves the development, marketing, sales and support of role playing action and strategy games. Blizzard also
develops, hosts, and supports its online subscription-based games in the MMORPG category. Blizzard is the development studio and publisher best known as the creator of

World of
Warcraft

and the multiple award winning

Diablo

,

StarCraft

, and

World of Warcraft

franchises. Blizzard distributes its products and generates revenues worldwide through various means, including: subscription revenues
(which consist of fees from individuals playing

World of Warcraft

, prepaid cards and other value-added service revenues such as realm transfers, faction
changes, and other character customizations within the

World of Warcraft

gameplay); retail sales of physical "boxed" products; online download sales of
PC products; and licensing of software to third-party or related party companies that distribute

World of Warcraft

and

StarCraft
II

.

(iii) Activision Blizzard Distribution

Activision Blizzard Distribution ("Distribution") consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistical and sales
distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Business Combination

On July 9, 2008, a business combination (the "Business Combination") by and among Activision, Inc., Sego Merger
Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Activision, Inc., Vivendi S.A.

1. Description of Business and Business Combination (Continued)

("Vivendi"),
VGAC LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi, and Vivendi Games, Inc. ("Vivendi Games"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of VGAC LLC was consummated. As a result of the
consummation of the Business Combination, Activision, Inc. was renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc. ("Activision Blizzard"). For accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as
a "reverse acquisition," with Vivendi Games deemed to be the acquirer. The historical financial statements of Activision Blizzard prior to July 10, 2008 are those of Vivendi Games.

The
common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol "ATVI." Vivendi owned approximately 61% of Activision Blizzard's outstanding common
stock at December 31, 2010.

We
maintain significant operations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom ("U.K."), France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Australia, Sweden, South Korea, China and the
Netherlands.

Activision Blizzard's Non-Core Exit Operations

Activision Blizzard's non-core exit operations ("Other" or "Non-Core") represent legacy Vivendi Games'
divisions or business units that we have exited, divested or wound down as part of our restructuring and integration efforts as a result of the Business Combination described above, but that do not
meet the criteria for separate reporting of discontinued operations. Prior to July 1, 2009, Non-Core activities were managed as a stand-alone operating segment; however, in light of
the minimal activities and insignificance of Non-Core activities, as of that date we ceased their management as a separate operating segment. Consequently, we are no longer providing
separate operating segment disclosure and have reclassified our prior periods' segment presentation so that it conforms to the current period's presentation.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies

Basis of Consolidation and Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.

Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current period presentation.

The
Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued, to provide additional evidence relative to certain
estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosures.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investment Securities

We consider all money market funds and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

Investments
designated as available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices or estimated based on quoted market prices of
financial instruments with similar characteristics. Unrealized gains and losses of the Company's available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a
component of other comprehensive income (loss), when credit losses are not expected and the Company does not intend, or it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required, to sell the
security prior to recovery of the security's amortized cost basis.

In
general, investments with original maturities greater than 90 days and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. In
addition, investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such investments represent the investment of cash that
is available for current operations.

The
specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed of with realized gains and losses reflected in investment and other income, net in the
consolidated statements of operations.

The
Company's investments include auction rate securities ("ARS"). These ARS are variable rate bonds tied to short-term interest rates with long-term maturities.
ARS have interest rates which reset through a modified Dutch auction at predetermined short-term intervals, typically every 7, 28, or 35 days. Interest on ARS is generally paid at
the end of each auction process and is based upon the interest rate determined for the prior auction. The majority of our ARS are AAA/Aaa rated, and are typically collateralized by student loans
guaranteed by the U.S. government under the Federal Family Education Loan Program or backed by monoline bond insurance companies.

On
November 14, 2008, we accepted an offer from UBS AG ("UBS"), providing us with rights related to our ARS held through UBS (the "Rights"). The Rights permitted us to require UBS
to purchase our ARS held through UBS at par value, which is defined as the price equal to the liquidation preference of the ARS plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest, at any time during the
period between June 30, 2010 and July 2, 2012. Conversely, UBS had the right, in its discretion, to purchase or sell our ARS at any time until July 2, 2012, so long as we receive
payment at par value upon any sale or disposition.

At
December 31, 2009, we held ARS through UBS, which were classified as trading securities. Investments designated as trading securities are reported at fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings.

The
Rights represented a firm agreement in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 815, regarding derivatives
and hedging ("ASC Topic 815"), which defines a firm agreement as an agreement binding on both parties and usually legally enforceable, with the following characteristics: (a) the agreement
specifies all significant terms, including the quantity to be exchanged, the fixed price, and the timing of the transaction, and (b) the agreement includes a disincentive for nonperformance
that is sufficiently large to make performance probable. The enforceability of the Rights was recognized as a free standing asset separate from the ARS. The Rights did not meet the definition of a
derivative instrument under ASC Topic 815, because the underlying securities were not readily convertible to cash. Therefore, we had elected to measure the Rights at fair value under ASC Subtopic
825-10 regarding the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities, which permits an entity to measure certain items at fair value, to mitigate volatility in reported
earnings from the changes in the fair value of the ARS. As a

result,
unrealized gains and losses were included in earnings during 2009 and 2008. At December 31, 2009, we had classified our investment in ARS held through UBS as a current asset and we
exercised the Rights on June 30, 2010.

Restricted Cash—Compensating Balances

Most of our restricted cash relates to a standby letter of credit required by one of our inventory manufacturers to qualify for payment
terms on our inventory purchases. Under the terms of this arrangement, we are required to maintain with the issuing bank a compensating balance, restricted as to use, of not less than the sum of the
available amount of the letter of credit plus the aggregate amount of any drawings under the letter of credit that have been honored thereunder, but not reimbursed. Restricted cash is included in
short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets.

Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses is a reasonable
approximation of fair value due to their short-term nature. Our U.S. treasuries and government agency securities and mortgage-backed securities are carried at fair value, with fair values
estimated based on quoted market prices or estimated based on quoted market prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics. Both short-term and long-term ARS are
carried at fair value, with fair values estimated using an income-approach model (specifically, a discounted cash-flow analysis). We carry derivative instruments, primarily foreign
exchange contracts, in the balance sheet as other assets or liabilities at their fair value. The fair value of foreign currency contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the
various hedged currencies as of the end of the period.

Activision
Blizzard transacts business in various foreign currencies and has significant international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting Activision
Blizzard to foreign currency risk. Activision Blizzard utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities. The foreign exchange forward contracts generally have contractual terms of less than a year. Activision Blizzard does not use foreign exchange forward contracts for
speculative or trading purposes. None of Activision Blizzard's foreign exchange forward contracts are designated as hedging instruments under ASC Topic 815. Accordingly, gains or losses resulting from
changes in the fair values of the foreign exchange contracts are reported as general and administrative expenses or investment and other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations
depending on the nature of derivatives.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments

On April 1, 2009, we adopted prospectively a new accounting standard addressing the evaluation of fixed maturity securities for
other-than-temporary impairments. These requirements have altered our policies and procedures for determining impairment charges recognized through earnings. The new standard
requires a company to recognize a credit component (a credit impairment) of an other-than-temporary impairment of a fixed maturity security in earnings and the
non-credit component in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) if the company does not intend, or it is more likely than not that the company will not be required, to sell the
security prior to recovery of the security's amortized cost basis. The new standard also changes the threshold for determining when an

F-10


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

other-than-temporary
impairment has occurred on a fixed maturity security with respect to intent and ability to hold the security until recovery and requires additional
disclosures. A credit impairment, which is recognized in earnings when it occurs, is the difference between the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security and the estimated present value of cash
flows expected to be collected (recovery value), as determined by management. The difference between fair value and amortized cost that is not related to a credit impairment is recognized as a
separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and
accounts receivable. We place our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions. At various times, we had deposits in excess of coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"),
or the equivalent agencies in overseas jurisdictions, at these financial institutions.

Our
customer base includes retail outlets and distributors, including mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game specialty stores in
the United States and countries worldwide. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses. We generally do not require collateral or other
security from our customers. We had one customer in our Activision and Blizzard operating segments, GameStop, who accounted for approximately 12% of consolidated net revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2010. GameStop and another customer, Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 12% and 18% of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2010, respectively.

For
the year ended December 31, 2009, we had two customers in our Activision and Blizzard operating segments, Wal-Mart and GameStop, who each accounted for
approximately 10% of consolidated net revenues and accounted for approximately 18% and 10% of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2009, respectively. For the year ended
December 31, 2008, we had two customers, Wal-Mart and GameStop, who each accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated net revenues.

Software Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses

Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct
costs incurred for internally developed products.

We
account for software development costs in accordance with the FASB guidance for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed ("ASC Subtopic
985-20"). Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility
of a product encompasses both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and tested product design and working model. Significant management judgments and estimates
are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Technological feasibility
is evaluated on a product-by-product basis. Prior to a product's release, we expense, as part of "cost of sales—software royalties and amortization", capitalized
costs if and when we believe such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized costs for those products that are cancelled or expected to be abandoned are charged to

F-11


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

product
development expense in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to product development expense.

Commencing
upon product release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "cost of sales—software royalties and amortization" based on the ratio of current
revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months or less.

Intellectual
property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks, copyrights, software, technology, music or other
intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our products. Depending upon the agreement with the rights
holder, we may obtain the rights to use acquired intellectual property in multiple products over multiple years, or alternatively, for a single product. Prior to the related product's release, we
expense, as part of "cost of sales—intellectual property licenses," capitalized intellectual property costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized intellectual
property costs for those products that are cancelled or expected to be abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation.

Commencing
upon the related product's release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to "cost of sales—intellectual property licenses" based on the
ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed property will be utilized. As intellectual property license contracts may extend
for multiple years, the amortization of capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year.

We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior
periods, the primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance
of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed trademark or copyright is to be used. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance
of comparable products developed with comparable technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and, for any sequel product, estimated performance based on the performance of the product on
which the sequel is based. Further, as many of our capitalized intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized
intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors, such as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property, whether there are any
future planned theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property, and the rights holder's continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property.

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the
assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the original
forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge.
Material differences may result in the amount and timing of charges for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in evaluating these qualitative factors.

Inventories

Inventories consist of materials (including manufacturing royalties paid to console manufacturers), labor and freight-in
and are stated at the lower of cost (weighted average method) or market value.

Long-Lived Assets

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the
estimated useful lives or the lease term: buildings, 25 to 33 years; computer equipment, office furniture and other equipment, 2 to 5 years; leasehold improvements, the shorter of
estimated useful lives or the life of the lease. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed and any resulting gains or losses are included in the
consolidated statements of operations.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Assets.

We account for goodwill using the provisions within ASC Topic 350. Under ASC Topic 350,
goodwill is
considered to have an indefinite life, and is carried at cost. Acquired trade names are assessed as indefinite lived assets as there are no foreseeable limits on the periods of time over which they
are expected to contribute cash flows. Goodwill and acquired trade names are not amortized, but are subject to an impairment test annually, as well as in between annual tests, when events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We perform our annual impairment testing at December 31

st

.

Our
annual goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. We have determined our reporting units based on the guidance within ASC Subtopic 350-20. As of
December 31, 2010, the Company's reporting units consisted of Activision, Blizzard, and Distribution. We test goodwill for possible impairment by first determining the fair value of the related
reporting unit and comparing this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill. In the event the recorded net assets of the reporting unit exceed the estimated fair
values, we perform a second step to measure the amount of the impairment, which is equal to the amount by which the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill after assessing the
fair value of each of the assets and liabilities within the reporting unit.

Fair
value is determined using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market comparable valuations of peer companies. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we
assumed a discount rate between 11.0% and 13.5%. The estimated fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a range of approximately $18 million to
$6 billion or 24% to 422% as of December 31, 2010. As such, we have determined that no impairment has occurred at December 31, 2010 based upon a set of assumptions regarding
discounted future cash flows, which represent our best estimate of future performance at this time.

In
completing our goodwill impairment analysis, we test the appropriateness of our reporting units' estimated fair value by reconciling the aggregate reporting units' fair values with
our market capitalization. Our impairment analysis indicated that the aggregate fair values of our reporting units exceeded our December 31, 2010 market capitalization by approximately
$4.6 billion or 30%.

The
fair value of an entity can be greater than its market capitalization for various reasons, one of which is the concept of control premium. A control premium is the amount that a
buyer is willing to pay over the current market price of a company to acquire a controlling interest. Substantial value may

F-13


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

arise
from the ability to take advantages of synergies, such as the expected increase in cash flow resulting from cost savings and revenue enhancements, and other benefits could be achieved by
controlling another entity. However, changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic conditions,
could result in future impairment charges.

We
test acquired trade names for possible impairment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. As of December 31, 2010, the estimated fair values of each of
our acquired trade names exceeded their carrying values by a range of approximately $143 million to $251 million, which exceeds their respective carrying values by a range of
approximately 37% to 534%. As such, we have determined that no impairment has occurred at December 31, 2010 based upon a set of assumptions regarding discounted future cash flows, which
represent our best estimate of future performance at this time. In determining the fair value of our trade names, we assumed a discount rate of 11%, and royalty saving rates of approximately 1.5%. A
one percentage point increase in the discount rate would not yield an impairment charge to our trade names. Changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function
of our future financial performance and changes in economic conditions, could result in future impairment charges.

Amortizable Intangible Assets.

Intangible assets subject to amortization are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible
assets subject
to amortization are amortized over the estimated useful life in proportion to the economic benefits received.

Management
evaluates the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets in accordance with FASB guidance within ASC Subtopic
360-10, which generally requires the assessment of these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists. We considered certain events and
circumstances in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable including, but not limited to: significant
changes in performance relative to expected operating results; significant changes in the use of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; a significant decline in our stock price
for a sustained period of time; and changes in our business strategy. In determining whether an impairment exists, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate
disposition of these assets. If an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets' carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which
the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.

In
the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded impairment charges of $67 million, $9 million and $250 million to license agreements, game engines and internally
developed franchises intangible assets, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded impairment charges of $24 million, $12 million and $373 million to license
agreements, game engines and internally developed franchises intangible assets, respectively. (See Note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements)

Revenue Recognition

Product Sales

We recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers and once any
performance obligations have been completed. Certain products are sold to customers with a street date (

i.e.,

the earliest date these products
may be sold by retailers). For these

F-14


ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)

products
we recognize revenue on the later of the street date or the sale date. Revenue from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection.

For
our software products with online functionality, we evaluate whether those features or functionality are more than an inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software
product. This evaluation is performed for each software product and any online transaction, such as an electronic download of a title or product add-ons, when it is released.

When
we determine that a software title contains online functionality that constitutes a more-than-inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the
product, principally because of its importance to gameplay, we consider that our performance obligations for this title extend beyond the sale of the game. Vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE")
of fair value does not exist for the online functionality, as we do not separately charge for this component of the title. As a result, we recognize all of the software-related revenue from the sale
of the title ratably over the estimated service period, which is estimated to begin the month after either the sale date or the street date of the title, whichever is later. In addition, we initially
defer the costs of sales for the title (excluding intangible asset amortization), and recognize the costs of sales as the related revenues are recognized. Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs,
software royalties and amortization, and intellectual property licenses.

We
recognize

World of Warcraft

boxed product, expansion packs and other value-added service revenues each with the related subscription
service revenue ratably over the estimated service periods beginning upon activation of the software and delivery of the services. Revenues attributed to the sale of

World of
Warcraft

boxed software and related expansion packs are classified as product sales and revenues attributable to subscription and other value-added services are classified as
subscription, licensing and other revenues.

Revenue
for software products with more than inconsequential separate service deliverables and

World of Warcraft

products are recognized
over the estimated service periods, which range from a minimum of five months to a maximum of less than a year.

For
our software products with features we consider to be incidental to the overall product offering and an inconsequential deliverable, such as products which provide limited online
features at no additional cost to the consumer, we recognize the related revenue from them upon the transfer of title and risk of loss of the product to our customer.

With
respect to online transactions, such as online downloads of titles or product add-ons that do not include a more-than-inconsequential separate
service deliverable, revenue is recognized when the fee is paid by the online customer to purchase online content, the product is available for download and is activated for gameplay. In addition,
persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection of the related receivable must be probable.

Sales
incentives and other consideration given by us to our customers are considered adjustments of the selling price of our products, such as rebates and product placement fees, and are
reflected as reductions to revenue. Sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received, such as the appearance of our products in a customer's
national circular ad, are reflected as sales and marketing expenses when the benefit from the sales incentive is separable from sales to the same customer and we can reasonably estimate the fair value
of the benefit.

Subscription Revenues

Subscription revenues are derived from

World of Warcraft

, a game that is playable
through Blizzard's servers on a subscription-only basis. After the first month of free usage that is included with the

World of Warcraft

boxed software, the

World of Warcraft

end user may enter into a subscription agreement for additional future access. Revenues associated with the sale
of subscriptions via packaged software and prepaid subscription cards, as well as prepaid subscriptions sales, are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and recognized
ratably over the subscription period. Revenue from internet gaming rooms in Asia is recognized upon usage of the time packages sold. Value-added service revenues associated with subscriptions are
recognized ratably over the estimated service periods.

Licensing Revenues

Third-party licensees in Russia, China and Taiwan distribute and host Blizzard's

World of
Warcraft

game in their respective countries under license agreements with Blizzard. We receive royalties from the licensees as a result. We recognize these royalties as
revenues based on the end users' activation of the underlying prepaid time, if all other performance obligations have been completed or based on usage by the end user when we have continuing service
obligations. We recognize any upfront licensing fee received over the term of the contracts.

With
respect to license agreements that provide customers the right to make multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenue is generally recognized upon delivery of a master
copy. Per copy royalties on sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned. In addition, persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection of the related receivable must be
probable.

Breakage Revenues

World of Warcraft

boxed product sales and subscription revenues are recognized upon
activation of the game. We analyze historical activation patterns over time to determine when the likelihood of activation ever occurring becomes remote. We recognize revenues from subscriptions that
have not yet been activated, prepaid subscription cards, as well as prepaid subscription sales, when the likelihood of future activation occurring is remote (defined as "breakage revenues"). In 2008,
we recognized breakage revenues for the first time since the initial launch of

World of Warcraft

. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009,
and 2008, we recorded $14 million, $5 million, and $6 million, respectively of breakage revenues from the sale of packaged software in product sales, and $6 million,
$8 million, and $16 million, respectively of prepaid and subscription breakage revenues in subscription, licensing and other revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.

Other Revenues

Other revenues primarily include licensing activity of intellectual property other than software to third-parties. Revenue is recorded
upon receipt of licensee statements, or upon the receipt of cash, provided the license period has begun.

Allowances for Returns, Price Protection, Doubtful Accounts, and Inventory Obsolescence

We closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other
publishers, market conditions, and the anticipated timing of other releases to assess future demand of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent reorders
are evaluated with the goal of ensuring that quantities are sufficient to meet the demand from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel. We
benchmark units to be shipped to our customers using historical and industry data.

We
may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the circumstances in which we elect to
decrease the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and applicable, allows customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and/or
future invoices. The conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or price protection include, among other things, compliance with applicable trading and payment
terms, and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell-through reports to us. We may also consider other factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory
and other market factors. Management must make estimates of potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product revenue. We estimate the amount of future returns
and price protection for current period product revenue utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer.
The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for a particular title: historical performance of titles in similar genres; historical performance of the
hardware platform; historical performance of the franchise; console hardware life cycle; sales force and retail customer feedback; industry pricing; weeks of on-hand retail channel
inventory; absolute quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory; our warehouse on-hand inventory levels; the title's recent sell-through history (if available);
marketing trade programs; and performance of competing titles. The relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other items, genre, platform, seasonality, and sales
strategy. Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period. Based upon
historical experience, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. However, actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a number of reasons
including, among others, a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor, or technological obsolescence due to the emergence of new
hardware platforms. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if factors or market conditions change or if management makes different judgments or utilizes
different estimates in determining the allowances for returns and price protection. For example, a 1% change in our December 31, 2010 allowance for sales returns, price protection and other
allowances would impact net revenues by approximately $4 million.

Similarly,
management must make estimates as to the collectability of our accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze the age of current
outstanding account balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes in our customers' payment terms and their economic
condition, as well as whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance. Any significant changes in any of these criteria would affect management's estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful
accounts.

We
regularly review inventory quantities on-hand and in the retail channel. We write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future
anticipated demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of
the inventory and net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, which are inherently difficult to assess and dependent on market conditions. At the point of a loss recognition, a
new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established basis.

Shipping and Handling

Shipping and handling costs, which consist primarily of packaging and transportation charges incurred to move finished goods to
customers, are included in "cost of sales—product costs."

Advertising Expenses

We expense advertising as incurred, except for production costs associated with media advertising which are deferred and charged to
expense the first time the related ad is run. Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $332 million, $366 million, and $241 million,
respectively, and are included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes using ASC Topic 740,

Income Taxes

. Under ASC Topic 740,
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

ASC
Topic 740 includes accounting guidance which clarifies the accounting for the uncertainty in recognizing income taxes in an organization by providing detailed guidance for financial
statement recognition, measurement and disclosure involving uncertain tax positions. This guidance requires an uncertain tax position to meet a more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized both upon the adoption of the related guidance and in subsequent periods.

Foreign Currency Translation

All assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance
sheet date, and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) in shareholders' equity.

Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share

Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding, increased by the weighted average number of common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents are calculated using the treasury stock method and represent incremental
shares issuable upon exercise of our outstanding options. However, potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings (loss) per share calculation when inclusion of
such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded.

On
January 1, 2009, we adopted the new accounting guidance for determining whether instruments granted in stock-based payment transactions are participating securities, and as a
result, unvested stock-based awards which include the right to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents are considered to participate with common stock in undistributed
earnings. Companies that issue stock-based awards considered to be participating securities are required to calculate basic and diluted earnings per common share amounts under the
two-class method. The two-class method excludes from earnings per common share calculations any dividends paid or owed to participating securities and any undistributed
earnings considered to be attributable to participating securities. The accounting guidance requires retrospective application to all prior-period earnings per share data presented. The adoption of
the accounting guidance did not change our basic or diluted loss per common share for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718-10,

Compensation-Stock
Compensation

and ASC Subtopic 505-50,

Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees

("ASC stock-based
compensation guidance"). Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the requisite services period is based on the value of stock-based payment awards after reduction for estimated forfeitures.
Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in
the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 included compensation expense for stock-based payment awards granted by Activision, Inc.
prior to, but not yet vested as of July 9, 2008, based on the revalued fair value estimated at July 9, 2008, and compensation expense for the stock-based payment awards granted
subsequent to July 9, 2008.

We
estimate the value of stock-based payment awards on the measurement date using a binomial-lattice model. Our determination of fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of
grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited
to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.

Prior
to the Business Combination, Vivendi Games had equity incentive plans that were equity-settled and cash-settled. Vivendi Games used a binomial model to assess the value
of these equity incentive awards. Equity-settled awards include stock options and restricted shares granted by Vivendi, and the cash-settled awards include stock appreciation rights and
restricted stock units granted both by

Vivendi
and under the Blizzard Equity Plan ("BEP"). The Company records a liability and recognizes changes in fair value of the liability that occur during the period as compensation cost over the
requisite service period. Changes in the fair value of the liability that occur after the end of the requisite service period are compensation cost of the period in which the change occurs. Any
differences between the amount for which the liability is settled and its fair value at the settlement date as estimated is an adjustment of compensation cost in the period of settlement. See
Note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

3. Acquisitions

Reverse Acquisition

The Business Combination (See Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements) is accounted for as a reverse
acquisition under the purchase method of accounting. For this purpose, Vivendi Games was deemed to be the accounting acquirer and Activision, Inc. was deemed to be the accounting acquiree.

The
purchase price of Activision, Inc. consists of the following items (amounts in millions):

The
fair value of Activision, Inc.'s stock awards was determined using the fair value of Activision, Inc.'s common stock of $15.04 per share, which was the closing price at
July 9, 2008, and using a binomial-lattice model and the following assumptions: (a) varying volatility ranging from 42.38% to 51.50%, (b) a risk free interest rate of 3.97%,
(c) an expected life ranging from 3.22 years to 4.71 years, (d) risk adjusted stock return of 8.89%, and (e) an expected dividend yield of 0.0%.

The
total unrealized loss of $4 million at December 31, 2010 is due to failed auctions of taxable ARS held through Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, which is 51%
owned by Morgan Stanley and 49% owned by Citigroup, Inc. The ARS were held directly through a wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, Inc. until the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC
joint-venture closed in the second quarter 2009. Our investments in ARS are all backed by higher education student loans.

Based
upon our analysis of the available-for-sale investments with unrealized losses, we have concluded that the gross unrealized losses of $4 million at
December 31, 2010 were temporary in nature. We do not intend to sell the investment securities that are in an unrealized loss position and do not consider that it is
more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. We have not
identified any issues related to the ultimate repayment of principal as a result of credit concerns on these securities. However, facts and circumstances may change which could result in a decline in
fair value considered to be other-than-temporary in the future.

Trading Investments

In 2008, prior to accepting the UBS offer (see Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements), we classified our
investment in ARS held through UBS as available-for-sale. We recorded unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale securities, net of tax, in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the shareholders' equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized loss did not reduce net income for the applicable accounting
period.

In
connection with our acceptance of the UBS offer in November 2008, resulting in our right to require UBS to purchase our ARS at par value beginning on June 30, 2010
(

i.e.,

the Rights), we transferred our investments in ARS held through UBS from available-for-sale to trading securities.
The transfer to trading securities reflected management's intent to exercise the Rights during the period between June 30, 2010 and July 3, 2012, which resulted in the securities being
held for the purpose of

F-24

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

6. Investments (Continued)

selling
them in the near future. Prior to our agreement with UBS, our intent was to hold the ARS until the market recovered. At the time of transfer, the unrealized loss on our ARS was
$5 million. This unrealized loss was included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Upon transfer to trading securities, we immediately recognized in investment income, net, the
$5 million unrealized loss not previously recognized in earnings. Subsequently, we recognized an additional decline in fair value
of $2 million for a total unrealized loss of $7 million, included in investment and other income (loss), net, in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2008. In June 2010, we exercised the Rights, thereby selling the remainder of our ARS held with UBS at par and recognized a gain of $7 million, which was offset by a loss of
$7 million for the change in fair value of the Rights, resulting in no impact to our investment and other income, net, in the consolidated statement of operations.

We have substantially completed our implementation of our organizational restructuring plan as a result of the Business Combination described in Note 1 of the notes to

primary goals of the organizational restructuring were to rationalize the title portfolio and consolidate certain corporate functions to realize synergies from the Business
Combination.

In
the fourth quarter of 2010, with the franchise and industry results of the holiday season, our outlook for the retail sales of software was significantly revised. With the continued
economic downturn within our industry in 2010 and the change in the buying habits of casual consumers, we reassessed our overall expectations. We considered these economic changes during our 2011
planning process conducted during the months of November and December, which resulted in a strategy change to, among other things, focus on fewer title releases in the casual genre and no music titles
with peripherals. As we consider this an indicator of impairment of our intangible assets, we updated our future projected revenue streams for certain franchises in the casual games and music genres.
We performed recoverability tests and, where applicable, measured the impairment of the related intangible assets in accordance with ASC Subtopic 360-10.

Determining
whether impairment has occurred requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the
estimated remaining useful life over which cash flows will occur, the amount of these cash flows and the asset's residual value, if any. For intangible assets that did not pass the recoverability
test, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available. Based on the characteristics of the assets being valued and the
availability of information, the Company used the income approach, which presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the estimated remaining
useful life of the asset, discounted to present value. We derived the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and applied an appropriate discount
rate. Based on this analysis, we recorded impairment charges of $67 million, $9 million and $250 million to license agreements, game
engines and internally developed franchises intangible assets, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010 within our Activision segment.

Similarly
in 2009, we recorded impairment charges of $24 million, $12 million and $373 million to license agreements, game engines and internally developed
franchises intangible assets, respectively, within our Activision segment.

14. Operating Segments and Geographic Region

Our operating segments are consistent with our internal organizational structure, the manner in which our operations are reviewed and managed by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our
Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), the manner in which operating performance is assessed and resources are allocated, and the availability of separate financial information. Currently, we
operate under three operating segments: Activision, Blizzard and Distribution (see Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). We do not aggregate operating segments.

The
CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of the impact of the change in deferred net revenues and related cost of sales with respect to certain of our online-enabled games,
stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expense, amortization of intangible assets and purchase price accounting related adjustments, impairment of intangible assets, integration and
transaction costs, and other. The CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis and, accordingly, no disclosure is made. Information on the operating
segments and reconciliations of total net revenues and total segment income (loss) from operations to consolidated

Non-Core activities, which are legacy Vivendi Games' divisions or business units that we have exited, divested or wound down as part of
our restructuring and integration efforts as a result of the Business Combination. Prior to July 1, 2009, Non-Core activities were managed as a stand-alone operating segment;
however, in light of the minimal activities and insignificance of Non-Core activities, as of that date we ceased their management as a separate operating segment. Consequently, we are no
longer providing separate operating segment disclosure and have reclassified our prior periods' segment presentation so that it conforms to the current period's presentation.

Our
unvested restricted stock rights (including restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and performance shares) are considered participating securities since these securities
have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents during the contractual period of the award. Since the unvested restricted stock rights are considered participating
securities, we are required to use the two-class method in our computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had
outstanding unvested restricted stock rights with respect to 12 million and 10 million shares of common stock on a weighted-average basis, respectively.

According
to the terms of our restricted stock plans, our unvested restricted stock rights do not participate with common stock in undistributed losses. Therefore, the
two-class method in our computation of basic and diluted net earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2008 does not apply as there were losses during this period.

In
July 2008, the Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of our outstanding common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend ("the split"). The
stock dividend was issued on September 5, 2008 to shareholders of record as of August 25, 2008. The par value of our common stock was maintained at the pre-split amount of
$.000001 per share. The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, including all share and per share data, have been restated as if the split had occurred as of the earliest period
presented.

15. Computation of Basic/Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share (Continued)

On
July 9, 2008, Vivendi obtained control of Activision, Inc. through acquisition of the majority of the outstanding common stock of Activision, Inc. For accounting
purposes, Vivendi Games is deemed to be the acquirer (as the transaction was a "reverse acquisition"—see Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements). As such, the
historical financial statements prior to July 10, 2008, are those of Vivendi Games.

Potential
common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per common share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive.
Therefore, options to acquire 25 million, 20 million, and 40 million shares of common stock were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per common share for
the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

As
of December 31, 2010, our available federal net operating loss carryforward of less than a million is subject to certain limitations as defined under Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforward will begin to expire in 2023. We have various state net operating loss carryforwards totaling $17 million which are not subject to
limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and will begin to expire in 2013. We have tax credit carryforwards of $5 million and $20 million for federal and state
purposes, respectively, which begin to expire in fiscal 2016.

Through
our foreign operations, we have approximately $54 million in net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2010, attributed mainly to losses in France, Ireland,
and Sweden. We evaluate our deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, to determine if a valuation allowance is required. We assess whether a valuation allowance should be established or
released based on the consideration of all available evidence using a "more likely than not" standard. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively
verified. At December 31, 2010, there are no valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.

Realization
of the U.S. deferred tax assets is dependent upon the continued generation of sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of tax credits and loss carryforwards. Although
realization

is
not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the net carrying value of the U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized.

Cumulative
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided approximated $759 million at December 31, 2010. Deferred income
taxes on these earnings have not been provided as these amounts are considered to be permanent in duration. It is not practical to estimate the amount of tax that would be payable upon distribution of
these earnings.

As
of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $132 million in total unrecognized tax benefits of which $130 million would affect our effective tax rate if
recognized. A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows (amounts in millions):

In
addition, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we reflected $111 million and $123 million, respectively, of income tax liabilities as non-current
liabilities because payment of cash or settlement is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date. These non-current income tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities
in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

We
recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had approximately $11 million and
$8 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded $3 million,
$6 million and $1 million of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions, respectively.

Vivendi
Games results for the period January 1, 2008 through July 9, 2008 are included in the consolidated federal and certain foreign, state and local income tax returns
filed by Vivendi or its affiliates while Vivendi Games results for the period July 10, 2008 through December 31, 2008 are included in the consolidated federal and certain foreign, state
and local income tax returns filed by Activision Blizzard. Vivendi Games is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for tax years before 2002. Vivendi Games is also no longer subject
to state examinations for tax years before 2000. Activision Blizzard's tax years 2007 through 2009 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject, including the
United States of America ("U.S.") and non-U.S. locations. Activision Blizzard is currently under audit by the California Franchise Tax Board for the tax years 2005 through 2007, and it is
reasonably possible that the current portion of our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly decrease within the next twelve months due to the outcome of these audits.

ACTIVISION BLIZZARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

16. Income Taxes (Continued)

On
July 9, 2008, Activision Blizzard entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement (the "Tax Sharing Agreement") with Vivendi. The Tax Sharing Agreement generally governs Activision
Blizzard's and Vivendi's respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to the ordinary course of business taxes. Currently, under the Tax Sharing Agreement, with certain exceptions,
Activision Blizzard generally is responsible for the payment of U.S. and certain non-U.S. income taxes that
are required to be paid to tax authorities on a stand-alone Activision Blizzard basis. In the event that Activision Blizzard joins Vivendi in the filing of a group tax return, Activision Blizzard will
pay its share of the tax liability for such group tax return to Vivendi, and Vivendi will pay the tax liability for the entire group to the appropriate tax authority. Vivendi will indemnify Activision
Blizzard for any tax liability imposed upon it due to Vivendi's failure to pay any group tax liability. Activision Blizzard will indemnify Vivendi for any tax liability imposed on Vivendi (or any of
its subsidiaries) due to Activision Blizzard's failure to pay any taxes it owes under the Tax Sharing Agreement.

Prior
to the Business Combination, Vivendi Games' income taxes are presented in the financial statements as if Vivendi Games were a stand-alone taxpayer even though Vivendi Games'
operating results are included in the consolidated federal, certain foreign, and state and local income tax returns of Vivendi or Vivendi's subsidiaries. Based on the subsequent filing of these tax
returns by Vivendi or Vivendi's subsidiaries, we determined that the amount paid by Vivendi Games was greater than the actual amount due (and settled) based upon filing of these returns for the year
ended December 31, 2008. This difference between the amount paid and the actual amount due (and settled) represents a return of capital to Vivendi, which was required in accordance with the
terms of the Business Combination agreement immediately prior to the close of the Business Combination. This difference has resulted in no additional payment to Vivendi and no impact to our
consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Within
the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible we will reduce approximately $66 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of statutes of
limitation and anticipated closure of income tax examinations.

17. Fair Value Measurements

Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis

FASB literature regarding fair value measurements for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities establishes a
three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of "observable inputs" and minimize the use of
"unobservable inputs." The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

•

Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices
for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

•

Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant
to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

Auction
Rate Securities ("ARS") rights from UBS represent an offer from UBS providing us with the right to require UBS to purchase our ARS held through UBS
at par value. To value the ARS rights, we considered the intrinsic value, time value of money, and our assessment of the credit worthiness of UBS. We exercised our ARS rights with UBS on
June 30, 2010.

As of December 31, 2009 other financial liability represented the earn-out liability from a previous acquisition. The
earn-out liability was recorded at fair value at the date of the Business Combination, as it was to be settled by a variable number of shares of our common stock based on the average of
the closing prices on each of the five business days immediately preceding issuance of the shares. When estimating the fair value, we considered our projection of revenues from the related titles
under the earn-out provisions. For the year ended December 31, 2010, there was a $23 million decrease in our fair value estimate of this financial liability, which was
recorded in investment and other income, net. There was no earn-out liability recorded at December 31, 2010.

(a)

Fair
value measurements have been estimated using an income-approach model (specifically, discounted cash-flow analysis). When estimating the
fair value, we consider both observable market data and non-observable factors, including credit quality, duration, insurance wraps, collateral composition, maximum rate formulas,
comparable trading instruments, and the likelihood of redemption. Significant assumptions used in the analysis include estimates for interest rates, spreads, cash flow timing and amounts, and holding
periods of the securities. Assets measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) represent less than 1% of our financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring
basis at December 31, 2010.

In
June 2010, we sold the remainder of our ARS held with UBS at par and recognized a gain of $7 million included within investment and other income, net in the consolidated
statement of operations.

ARS
rights from UBS represented an offer from UBS providing us with the right to require UBS to purchase our ARS held through UBS at par value. To value the
ARS rights, we considered the intrinsic value, time

of money, and our assessment of the credit worthiness of UBS. We exercised our ARS rights with UBS on June 30, 2010 and recorded a loss of $7 million included within investment and
other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges

We transact business in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar and have significant international sales and expenses denominated
in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, subjecting us to currency exchange rate risks. To mitigate our risk from foreign currency fluctuations we periodically enter into currency derivative
contracts, principally swaps and forward contracts with maturities of twelve months or less, with Vivendi as our principal counterparty. We do not hold or purchase any foreign currency contracts for
trading or speculative purposes and we do not designate these forward contracts or swaps as hedging instruments. Accordingly, we report the fair value of these contracts in the consolidated balance
sheet with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of foreign currency contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various
hedged currencies as of the end of the period.

Fair Value Measurements on a Non-Recurring Basis

We measure the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis, generally annually or when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.

In
accordance with the provisions of the impairment of long-lived assets subsections of ASC Subtopic 360-10, intangible assets were written down to their fair
value during in the quarter ended December 31, 2010 within our Activision operating segment. The write down resulted in impairment charges of $67 million, $9 million and
$250 million to license agreements, game engines and internally developed franchises intangible assets, respectively (see Note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements
for details).

We
recorded impairment charges of $24 million, $12 million and $373 million to license agreements, game engines and internally developed franchises intangible
assets, respectively, in the quarter ended December 31, 2009 within our Activision operating segment.

18. Commitments and Contingencies

Credit Facilities

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we maintained a $22 million and $30 million irrevocable standby letter of credit,
respectively. The standby letter of credit is required by one of our inventory manufacturers to qualify for payment terms on our inventory purchases. Under the terms of this arrangement, we are
required to maintain on deposit with the bank a compensating balance, restricted as to use, of not less than the sum of the available amount of the letter of credit plus the aggregate amount of any
drawings under the letter of credit that have been honored thereunder, but not reimbursed. The letter of credit was undrawn at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

At
December 31, 2010 and 2009, our publishing subsidiary located in the U.K. maintained a EUR 30 million ($40 million and $43 million, respectively)
irrevocable standby letter of credit. The standby letter of credit is required by one of our inventory manufacturers to qualify for payment terms on our inventory purchases. The standby letter of
credit does not require a compensating balance and expires in July 2011. No amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

On
April 29, 2008, Activision, Inc. entered into a senior unsecured credit agreement with Vivendi, as lender. Borrowings under the agreement became available upon
consummation of the Business Combination. The credit agreement provided for a revolving credit facility of up to $475 million, bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.20% per annum. Any unused amount
under the revolving credit facility was subject to a commitment fee of 0.42% per annum. No borrowings under revolving credit facility with Vivendi were outstanding at December 31, 2009.
Effective July 23, 2010, we terminated our unsecured credit agreement.

Commitments

In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for non-cancelable operating
lease agreements for our offices, for the development of products, and for the rights to intellectual property. Under these agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor, developer
or intellectual property holder, as the case may be, based upon contractual arrangements. The payments to third-party developers are generally conditioned upon the achievement by the developers of
contractually specified development milestones. Further, these payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders typically are deemed to be advances and are

against future royalties earned by the developer or intellectual property holder based on the sale of the related game. Additionally, in connection with certain intellectual property rights
acquisitions and development agreements, we will commit to spend specified amounts for marketing support for the related game(s) which is to be developed or in which the intellectual property will be
utilized. Assuming all contractual provisions are met, the total future minimum commitments for these and other contractual arrangements in place at December 31, 2010 are scheduled to be paid

We
have omitted uncertain tax liabilities from this table due to the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of potential issue resolution. Specifically,
either (a) the underlying positions have not been fully developed under audit to quantify at this time or, (b) the years relating to the issues for certain jurisdictions are not
currently under audit. At December 31, 2010, we had $132 million of unrecognized tax benefits.

Legal Proceedings

After concluding an internal human resources inquiry into breaches of contract and insubordination by two senior employees at Infinity
Ward, the Company terminated its employment of Jason West and Vince Zampella on March 1, 2010. On March 3, 2010, West and Zampella filed a complaint against the Company in Los Angeles
Superior Court for breach of contract and wrongful termination, among other claims. West and Zampella are seeking damages, including punitive damages, in excess of $36 million and declaratory
relief. On April 9, 2010, the Company filed a
cross complaint against West and Zampella, asserting claims for breach of contract and fiduciary duty, among other claims. The Company is seeking damages and declaratory relief.

In
addition, 38 current and former employees of Infinity Ward filed a complaint against the Company in Los Angeles Superior Court on April 27, 2010
(

Alderman et al. v. Activision Publishing, Inc. et al)

. An amended complaint was filed on July 8, 2010, which added seven additional
plaintiffs. On October 5, 2010, five plaintiffs, all current employees of Infinity Ward, filed dismissals without prejudice. There are currently 40 plaintiffs in the case. The plaintiffs have
asserted claims for breach of contract, violation of the Labor Code of the State of California, conversion and other claims. The plaintiffs claim that the Company failed to pay them bonuses and other
compensation allegedly owed

to
them in an amount of at least $75 million to $125 million, plus punitive damages. On October 12, 2010, the court consolidated this matter with the West and Zampella matter.

On
August 10, 2010, the Company filed a demurrer to various causes of action in the amended Alderman complaint. On October 15, 2010, the court overruled the demurrer with
respect to all causes of action other than conversion, for which it was sustained. On November 4, 2010, the Alderman plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. On November 15, 2010,
the Company filed a demurrer with respect to the claim for conversion in the second amended complaint.

On
January 18, 2011, the court granted the Company's motion to amend its cross complaint against West and Zampella to add allegations with respect to them and to add Electronic
Arts, Inc. as a party. On January 26, 2011, Electronic Arts, Inc. filed a demurrer with respect to the claims asserted against it in the amended cross complaint. On
January 31, 2011, the case was transferred to the complex division, staying the case pending a status hearing with the new judge. A status conference is scheduled for March 16, 2011.

The
Company has accrued and will continue to accrue appropriate amounts related to bonuses and other monies allegedly owed in connection with this matter. The Company does not expect
this lawsuit to have a material impact on the Company.

In
addition, we are party to other routine claims and suits brought by us and against us in the ordinary course of business, including disputes arising over the ownership of intellectual
property rights, contractual claims, employment laws, regulations and relationships, and collection matters. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such
routine claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

19. Stock-Based Compensation

Activision Blizzard Equity Incentive Plans

The Activision Blizzard Inc. 2008 Incentive Plan was adopted by our Board on July 28, 2008, approved by our stockholders
and amended and restated by our Board on September 24, 2008, further amended and restated by our Board with stockholder approval on June 3, 2009, further amended and restated by the
Compensation Committee of our Board with stockholder approval on December 17, 2009, and further amended and restated by our Board and the Compensation Committee of our Board with shareholder
approval on June 3, 2010 (as so amended and restated, the "2008 Plan"). The 2008 Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors to provide stock-based compensation in the
form of stock options, share appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and other performance- or value-based awards structured by the
Compensation Committee within parameters set forth in the 2008 Plan, including custom awards that are denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or
related to, shares of our common stock, or factors that may influence the value of our common stock or that are valued based on our performance or the performance of any of our subsidiaries or
business units or other factors designated by the Compensation Committee, as well as incentive bonuses, for the purpose of providing incentives and rewards for performance to the directors, officers,
and employees of, and consultants to, Activision Blizzard and its subsidiaries.

19. Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)

While
the Compensation Committee has broad discretion to create equity incentives, our stock-based compensation program for the most part currently utilizes a combination of options and
restricted stock units. Options have time-based vesting schedules, generally vesting annually over a period of three to five years, and all options expire ten years from the grant date.
Restricted stock units either have time-based vesting schedules, generally vesting in their entirety on an
anniversary of the date of grant, or vesting annually over a period of three to five years, or vest only if certain performance measures are met. In addition, under the terms of the 2008 Plan, the
exercise price for the options must be equal to or greater than the closing price per share of our common stock on the date the award is granted, as reported on NASDAQ.

Upon
the effective date of the 2008 Plan, we ceased to make awards under the following equity incentive plans (collectively, the "Prior Plans"), although such plans will remain in effect
and continue to govern outstanding awards: (i) Activision, Inc. 1998 Incentive Plan, as amended; (ii) Activision, Inc. 1999 Incentive Plan, as amended;
(iii) Activision, Inc. 2001 Incentive Plan, as amended; (iv) Activision, Inc. 2002 Incentive Plan, as amended; (v) Activision, Inc. 2002 Executive Incentive
Plan, as amended; (vi) Activision, Inc. 2002 Studio Employee Retention Incentive Plan, as amended; (vii) Activision, Inc. 2003 Incentive Plan, as amended; and
(viii) Activision, Inc. 2007 Incentive Plan.

Pursuant
to the 2008 Plan as adopted, 30 million shares of our common stock were made available for issuance. The 2008 plan was amended with stockholder approval on
December 17, 2009 to increase the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance thereunder by 14 million and was further amended with stockholder approval on June 3,
2010 to increase the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance thereunder by 56 million. The number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the 2008 Plan may
be further increased from time to time by: (i) the number of shares relating to awards outstanding under any Prior Plan that: (a) expire, or are forfeited, terminated or cancelled,
without the issuance of shares; (b) are settled in cash in lieu of shares; or (c) are exchanged, prior to the issuance of shares of our common stock, for awards not involving our common
stock; and (ii) if the exercise price of any option outstanding under any Prior Plan is, or the tax withholding requirements with respect to any award outstanding under any Prior Plan are,
satisfied by withholding shares otherwise then deliverable in respect of the award or the actual or constructive transfer to the Company of shares already owned, the number of shares equal to the
withheld or transferred shares. At December 31, 2010, we had approximately 60 million shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2008 Plan. Shares issued in
connection with awards made under the 2008 Plan are generally issued as new stock issuances.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan was terminated by the Board of Directors and there were no further purchases thereunder after
October 1, 2008. Effective October 1, 2005, the Board of Directors of Activision, Inc. approved the Activision, Inc. Third Amended and Restated 2002 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan and the Activision, Inc. Second Amended and Restated 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for International Employees (together, the "ESPP"). Before the termination, up to an aggregate of
4,000,000 shares of Activision, Inc. common stock was available for purchase by eligible employees during two six-month offering periods that commenced each April 1 and
October 1 (the "Offering Period") at a price per share generally equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on the first day of the Offering Period and the fair
market value of our common stock on the purchase date (the last day of the Offering Period). Employees had been able to purchase

shares
having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an Offering Period and were limited to a maximum of $10,000 in value for any two purchases within the same calendar year. As
a result of the Business Combination the offering period in effect at the time of the Business Combination was assumed by us, and on October 1, 2008, employees purchased 262,002 shares of our
common stock at a purchase price of $11.65 per share under the ESPP.

Blizzard Equity Plan ("BEP")

In 2006, Blizzard implemented the BEP, an equity incentive plan denominated in U.S. dollars. Under the BEP, restricted shares of
Blizzard stock and other cash settled awards were granted to certain key executives and employees of Blizzard.

Under
the provisions of the BEP and the Business Combination Agreement, the consummation of the Business Combination was deemed to be a change in control. As such, the outstanding
non-vested rights became immediately vested upon the closing of the Business Combination, cancelled and extinguished and converted into a new right to receive an amount in cash eighteen
months after the closing upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the BEP and in the Business Combination Agreement, including continued employment through the payment date. The
determination of the value of Blizzard shares upon a change in control was equal to the transaction value under the provisions of the BEP. At December 31, 2009, other current liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheet included $87 million related to this plan, which was settled during 2010.

Method and Assumptions on Valuation of Stock Options

Our employee stock options have features that differentiate them from exchange-traded options. These features include lack of
transferability, early exercise, vesting restrictions, pre- and post-vesting termination provisions, blackout dates, and time-varying inputs. In addition, some of
the options have non-traditional features, such as accelerated vesting upon the satisfaction of certain performance conditions that must be reflected in the valuation. A binomial-lattice
model was selected because it is better able to explicitly address these features than closed-form models such as the Black-Scholes model, and is able to reflect expected future changes in
model inputs, including changes in volatility, during the option's contractual term.

We
have estimated expected future changes in model inputs during the option's contractual term. The inputs required by our binomial-lattice model include expected volatility,
risk-free interest rate, risk-adjusted stock return, dividend yield, contractual term, and vesting schedule, as well as measures of employees' forfeiture, exercise, and
post-vesting termination behavior. Statistical methods were used to estimate employee rank- specific termination rates. These termination rates, in turn, were used to model the
number of options that are expected to vest and post-vesting termination behavior. Employee rank-specific estimates of Expected Time-To-Exercise
("ETTE") were used to reflect employee exercise behavior. ETTE was estimated by using statistical procedures to first estimate the conditional probability of exercise occurring during each time
period, conditional on the option surviving to that time period and then using those probabilities to estimate ETTE. The model was calibrated by adjusting parameters controlling exercise and
post-vesting termination behavior so that the measures output by the model matched values of these measures that were estimated from historical data.

Upon
consummation of the Business Combination the fair value of Activision, Inc.'s stock awards was determined using the fair value of Activision, Inc.'s common stock of
$15.04 per share, which was the closing price at July 9, 2008, and using a binomial-lattice model with the following assumptions: (a) varying volatility ranging from 42.38% to 51.50%,
(b) a risk free interest rate of 3.97%, (c) an expected life ranging from 3.22 years to 4.71 years, (d) risk adjusted stock return of 8.89%, and (e) an
expected dividend yield of 0.0%.

To
estimate volatility for the binomial-lattice model, we use methods that consider the implied volatility method based upon the volatilities for exchange-traded options on our stock to
estimate short-term volatility, the historical method (annualized standard deviation of the instantaneous returns on Activision Blizzard's stock) during the option's contractual term to
estimate long-term volatility, and a statistical model to estimate the transition or "mean reversion" from short-term volatility to long-term volatility. Based on
these methods, for options granted during the year ended December 31, 2010, the expected stock price volatility ranged from 32.87% to 53.71%.

As
is the case for volatility, the risk-free rate is assumed to change during the option's contractual term. Consistent with the calculation required by a binomial-lattice
model, the risk-free rate reflects the interest from one time period to the next ("forward rate") as opposed to the interest rate from the grant date to the given time period ("spot
rate"). The expected dividend yield assumption for options granted during the year ended December 31, 2010 is based on the Company's historical and expected future amount of dividend payouts.

The
expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is an output from the binomial-lattice model.
The expected life of employee stock options depends on all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. A binomial-lattice model can be viewed as assuming that employees will exercise
their options when the stock price equals or exceeds an exercise boundary. The exercise boundary is not constant, but continually declines as the option's expiration date approaches. The exact
placement of the exercise boundary depends on all of the model inputs as well as the measures that are used to calibrate the model to estimated measures of employees' exercise and termination
behavior.

As
stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it
has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience.

Accuracy of Fair Value Estimates

We developed the assumptions used in the binomial-lattice model, including model inputs and measures of employees' exercise and
post-vesting
termination behavior. Our ability to accurately estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards at the grant date depends upon the accuracy of the model and our ability to accurately forecast
model inputs as long as ten years into the future. These inputs include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility, risk-free rate, dividend yield, and employee termination
rates. Although the fair value of employee stock options is determined using an option-pricing model, the estimates that are produced by this model may not be indicative of the fair value observed
between a willing buyer and a willing seller. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine if this is the case, as markets do not currently exist that permit the active trading of employee stock option
and other stock-based instruments.

Non-Plan Employee Stock Options Granted to Executives

In connection with prior employment agreements between Activision, Inc. and Robert A. Kotick, our Chief Executive Officer, and
Brian G. Kelly, our Co-Chairman, Mr. Kotick and Mr. Kelly were previously granted options to purchase common stock of Activision, Inc. which were not awarded under a
stockholder- or board-approved plan. These awards were assumed as a result of the Business Combination and accounted for as an exchange for options to purchase our common stock. All
non-plan options were exercised during 2009.

Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Awards Activities

We grant restricted stock units and restricted stock awards (collectively referred to as "restricted stock rights") under the 2008 Plan
to employees around the world, and we have assumed as a result of the Business Combination the restricted stock rights granted by Activision, Inc. Restricted stock rights entitle the holders
thereof to receive shares of our common stock at the end of a specified period of time or otherwise upon a specified occurrence (which may include the satisfaction of a performance measure).
Restricted stock awards are issued and outstanding upon grant. Holders of restricted stock rights are restricted from selling the shares until they vest. Upon vesting of restricted stock rights, we
may withhold shares otherwise deliverable to satisfy tax withholding requirements. Restricted stock rights are subject to forfeiture and transfer restrictions. Vesting for restricted stock rights is
contingent upon the holders' continued employment with us and may be subject to other conditions (which may include the satisfaction of a performance measure). If the vesting conditions are not met,
unvested restricted stock rights will be forfeited.

In
connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, on July 9, 2008, Robert A. Kotick, our Chief Executive Officer, received a grant of 2,500,000 market
performance-based restricted shares, which vest in 20% increments on each of the first, second, third, and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, with another 20% vesting on December 31,
2012, the expiration date of Mr. Kotick's employment agreement with the Company, in each case subject to the Company attaining the specified compound annual total shareholder return target for
that vesting period. If the Company does not achieve the market performance measure for a vesting period, no performance shares will vest for that vesting period. If, however, the Company achieves the
market performance measure for a subsequent vesting period, then all of the performance shares that would have vested on the previous vesting date will vest on the vesting date when the market
performance measure is achieved.

The
following table summarizes our restricted stock rights activity for the year ended December 31, 2010 (amounts in thousands except per share amounts):.

stock options and restricted stock awards granted to employees and directors that were outstanding and unvested at the date of the Business Combination, were accounted for as an exchange of awards.
The fair value of the outstanding vested and unvested awards was measured on the date of the acquisition, and for unvested awards which require service subsequent to the date of the Business
Combination, a portion of the awards' fair values have been allocated to future service and will be recognized over the remaining future requisite service period.

The
following table sets forth the total stock-based compensation expense resulting from stock options granted by Activision Inc. or Activision Blizzard, restricted stock rights
awarded by Activision, Inc. or Activision Blizzard, awards made to our employees under the BEP, and awards made to our employees under the Vivendi corporate plans described below included in
our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 (amounts in millions):

Repurchase Program

On November 5, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (the "2008-2009
Stock Repurchase Program") under which we were authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. On July 31, 2009, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of
$250 million to the 2008-2009 Stock Repurchase Program bringing the total authorization to $1.25 billion. During 2009, we repurchased 114 million shares of our common
stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,235 million pursuant to the 2008-2009 Stock Repurchase Program. In January 2010, we settled a $15 million purchase of
1.3 million shares of our common stock that we had agreed to repurchase in December 2009 pursuant to the 2008-2009 Stock Repurchase Program, completing that program.

On
February 10, 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program (the "2010 Stock Repurchase Program") under which we may repurchase up to
$1 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we repurchased 84 million shares of our common stock for $944 million pursuant to the 2010 Stock Repurchase Program. In
January 2011, we settled a $22 million purchase of 1.8 million shares of our common stock that we had agreed to repurchase in December 2010 pursuant to the 2010 Stock Repurchase Program.
The 2010 Stock Repurchase Program expired on December 31, 2010.

On
February 3, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock, on terms and

financial instruments, primarily currency forward contracts and swaps,

23. Related Party Transactions (Continued)

with
Vivendi as our principal counterparty. The gross notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange swaps was $138 million and $120 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. A pretax net unrealized gain of less than a million and unrealized loss of $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, resulted from the
foreign exchange contracts and swaps with Vivendi and were recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.

Prior
to the Business Combination, Vivendi maintained a centralized cash management pool from which Vivendi Games borrowed and loaned cash on a daily basis. Net cash transfers, under the
cash pooling agreement, were included in owner's equity as part of net transfers to Vivendi. Vivendi charged Vivendi Games interest on the cumulative net cash transfers and such charges are included
in investment income (loss), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Net interest earned from Vivendi for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $4 million.

In
addition, in accordance with the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, in 2008 Vivendi Games settled its payable to Vivendi S.A. and distributed its excess cash
on-hand as defined in the Business Combination Agreement immediately prior to the close of the transaction, resulting in cash payments of $79 million to settle its payable and
$79 million to distribute its excess cash to Vivendi.

Others

Activision Blizzard has entered into various transactions and agreements, including cash management services, investor agreement, tax
sharing agreement, and music royalty agreements with Vivendi and its subsidiaries and affiliates. Effective July 23, 2010, we terminated our unsecured credit agreement with Vivendi, the lender,
which provided for a revolving credit facility of up to $475 million. None of these services, transactions and agreements with Vivendi and its subsidiaries and affiliates is material either
individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements as a whole.

Annual
overhead and support costs were allocated to Vivendi Games by Vivendi to approximate management leadership, treasury, legal, tax and other similar service-based support functions
incurred on Vivendi Games' behalf. These costs amounted to approximately $2 million in 2008. These allocations were included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as general
and administrative expense.

For
the year ended December 31, 2008, a management fee of approximately $1 million was allocated to Vivendi Games from Vivendi for insurance, share-employee costs and other
general corporate support functions incurred on Vivendi Games' behalf. This allocation is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as general and administrative expense.

In
addition, we are party to a number of agreements with Universal Music Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vivendi, and its affiliates. These agreements pertain to the licensing of
master recordings and compositions for our games and for marketing and promotional purposes. We expensed and paid an aggregate of $12 million, $14 million and $2 million in
royalties and other fees (including fees relating to the marketing of artists whose music was licensed for our games) to Universal Music Group and its affiliates for those uses during the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Royalty amounts due to Universal Music Group and its affiliates are not material at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

24. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2009, the FASB issued an update to

Revenue Recognition—Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

. This update
establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements
including multiple revenue-generating activities. This update provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables, measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units
of accounting. The amendments in this update also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. Significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to
provide information about a vendor's multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, including information about the nature and terms, significant deliverables, and its performance within arrangements. The
amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling-price method affects the timing
or amount of revenue recognition. The amendments in this update are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after
June 15, 2010. The adoption of this update on January 1, 2011 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In
October 2009, the FASB issued an update to

Software—Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements

. This
update changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are "essential to the functionality," and excludes these products from the
scope of current software revenue guidance. The new guidance will include factors to help companies determine which software elements are considered "essential to the functionality." The amendments
will now subject software-enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements, such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple-deliverables. The amendments in this
update are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The adoption of this update on
January 1, 2011 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

25. Subsequent events

Restructuring Plan.

On February 3, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a restructuring plan involving a focus on
the
development and publication of a reduced slate of titles on a going-forward basis, including the discontinuation of the development of all music-based games and
the closure of the related business unit and the cancellation of other titles then in production, and a related reduction in studio headcount and corporate overhead. Driven by a desire to improve
operating margin by focusing the Company's resources on titles the Company believes have the largest potential for success and the anticipation of a continuing weak environment for casual and
music-based games, the plan will result in the separation of approximately 500 employees. The plan is expected to be implemented in the quarter ending March 31, 2011, resulting in a net pretax
charge in the first two quarters of 2011, which is expected to total between $35 million and $50 million, comprised of severance costs, the costs of other separation benefits and other
exit costs. All of the above estimated charges are expected to result in future cash expenditures during 2011.

Repurchase Program.

On February 3, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we may
repurchase up to
$1.5 billion of our common stock until the earlier of March 31, 2012 and a determination by the Board of Directors to discontinue the repurchase program.
