Item 1.    BUSINESS

(a)

General

Activision, Inc. is a leading international publisher of interactive entertainment software and peripheral products. We have built a company with a diverse
portfolio of products that spans a wide range of categories and target markets and that are used on a variety of game hardware platforms and operating systems. We have created, licensed, and acquired
a group of highly recognizable franchises, which we market to a variety of consumer demographics. Our fiscal 2008 product portfolio included titles such as

Guitar Hero III:
Legends of Rock, Guitar Hero II

for the Microsoft Xbox360

, Guitar Hero: Rocks the 80s

for the PS2,

Call
of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Spider-Man 3 The Game ("Spider-Man 3"), Shrek the Third, TRANSFORMERS: The Game, Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, Tony Hawk's Proving Ground, Bee Movie
Game,

and

Spider-Man: Friend or Foe.

Our
products cover diverse game categories including action/adventure, action sports, racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person action, music-based gaming, and strategy.
Our target customer base ranges from casual players to game enthusiasts, children to adults, and mass-market consumers to "value" buyers. We currently offer our products primarily in
versions that operate on the Sony PlayStation 2 ("PS2"), the Sony PlayStation 3 ("PS3"), the Nintendo Wii ("Wii"), and the Microsoft Xbox360 ("Xbox360") console systems, the Nintendo Dual Screen
("NDS"), and the Sony PlayStation Portable ("PSP") hand-held devices, and the personal computer ("PC"). The installed base for the previous generation of hardware platforms
(e.g., the PS2) is significant and the fiscal 2006 release of the Xbox360 and the fiscal 2007 releases of the PS3 and the Wii have further expanded the software market. To take advantage of the
growth of the PS3, the Xbox360, and the Wii ("the next-generation platforms"), during fiscal 2008, we increased our presence on the next-generation platforms through the
increased number of new released titles on the next-generation platforms. For example, the number of new released titles for the Wii tripled from 5 releases during fiscal 2007 to 15
releases, and we successfully released several major titles for the PS3, the Xbox360 and/or the Wii—

Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock

,

Call of Duty 4: Modern
Warfare

,

Spider-Man 3

,

Shrek the
Third

,

TRANSFORMERS: The Game

, and

Tony Hawk's Proving Ground

. Some of these
titles are also available on the PS2. Our plan is to continue to build a significant presence on the next-generation platforms by continuing to expand


the
number of titles released on the next-generation and hand-held platforms while continuing to market to the PS2 platform as long as economically attractive given its large
installed base.

Our
publishing business involves the development, marketing, and sale of products directly, by license, or through our affiliate label program with certain third-party publishers. Our
distribution business consists of operations in Europe that provide logistical and sales services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and
manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

We
were originally incorporated in California in 1979. In December 1992, we reincorporated in Delaware. In June 2000, we reorganized into our current holding company organizational
structure.

(b)

Business Combinations

We have completed a number of acquisitions of both software development companies and interactive entertainment product distribution companies. In fiscal 2008, we
acquired Bizarre Creations Limited, a video game developer focusing on the racing category. Also, in fiscal 2008, we completed the acquisition of DemonWare, Ltd., a provider of network
middleware technologies for console and PC games. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
for additional information regarding the accounting treatment of these and prior acquisitions.

On
December 2, 2007, we and Vivendi S.A. ("Vivendi") (Euronext Paris: VIV) announced the signing of a definitive agreement to combine Vivendi Games, Inc.
("Vivendi Games"), Vivendi's interactive entertainment business which includes Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. with us. If the transaction closes, we will be renamed Activision
Blizzard, Inc. ("Activision Blizzard"), and we expect to continue to operate as a public company traded on NASDAQ under the ticker ATVI. While we will be the legal acquirer and the surviving
entity in this transaction, Vivendi Games will be deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction treated as a reverse acquisition for accounting purposes. See Note 20 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the pending business combination with Vivendi
Games.

(c)

Financial Information About Industry Segments

We have two reportable segments: publishing and distribution. Publishing relates to the development (both internally and externally), marketing and sale of DVD,
CD, UMD, online, and cartridge-based interactive entertainment software and peripheral products owned or controlled by us directly, by license, or through our affiliate label program with certain
third-party publishers. Distribution primarily refers to logistical and sales services provided by our European distribution subsidiaries to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment
software, our own publishing operations and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain financial information regarding reporting segment and geographic areas required by Item 1 of Form 10-K.

Narrative Description of Business

Our objective is to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of quality interactive entertainment software and peripheral products
that deliver a highly satisfying consumer
entertainment experience. Our business strategy, the key components of our business operations, and the risk factors that could impact our business are detailed below.


Strategy

Create, Acquire, and Maintain Strong Franchises.

We focus development and publishing activities principally on products that
are, or have the potential to become, franchises with sustainable consumer appeal and recognition. It is our experience that these products can then serve as the basis for sequels, prequels, and
related new products that can be released over an extended period of time. We believe that the publishing and distribution of products based in large part on franchises enhances predictability of
revenues and the probability of high unit volume sales and operating profits. We have created a number of successful internally developed intellectual properties such as the Guitar Hero and Call of
Duty franchises. We have also entered into a series of strategic relationships with the owners of intellectual property pursuant to which we have acquired the rights to publish products based on
franchises such as Marvel Entertainment, Inc. properties, including Spider-Man and X-Men. We have multi-year, multi-property agreements with DreamWorks
Animation LLC that grant us the exclusive rights to publish video games based on DreamWorks Animation SKG's theatrical releases, including "Shark Tale," which was released in the second quarter
fiscal 2005, "Madagascar," which was released in the first quarter fiscal 2006, "Over the Hedge," which was released in the first quarter fiscal 2007, "Shrek the Third," which was released in the
first quarter fiscal 2008, "Bee Movie," which was released in the third quarter fiscal 2008, and all of their respective sequels. In addition, our multi-year agreements with DreamWorks
Animation LLC grant us the exclusive video game rights to three upcoming DreamWorks Animation feature films, including "Kung Fu Panda," "Monsters vs Aliens" and "How to Train Your Dragon." We
plan to release

Kung Fu Panda

,

Monsters vs Aliens

, and

Madagascar 2

during fiscal 2009 coinciding with
each of their respective theatrical releases. We have a strategic alliance with Harrah's
Entertainment, Inc. that grants us the exclusive, worldwide interactive rights to develop and publish "World Series of Poker" video games based on the popular World Series of Poker Tournament.
We also have an agreement with MGM Interactive and EON Productions Ltd. to develop and publish video games based on the James Bond license and with Hasbro Properties Group ("Hasbro") to develop
and publish video games based on the "Transformers" franchise.

Execute Disciplined Product Selection and Development Processes.

The success of our publishing business depends, in
significant part, on our ability to develop high quality games that will generate high unit volume sales. Our publishing units have implemented a formal control process for the selection, development,
production, and quality assurance of our products. We apply this process, which we refer to as the "Greenlight Process," to all of our products, whether externally or internally developed. The
Greenlight Process includes in-depth reviews of each project at several important stages
of development by a team that includes many of our highest-ranking operating managers and coordination between our sales and marketing personnel and development staff at each step in the process.

We
develop our products using a combination of our internal development resources and external development resources acting under contract with us. We typically select our external
developers based on their track record and expertise in producing products in the same category. One developer will often produce the same game for multiple platforms and will produce sequels to the
original game. We believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources, which we
believe adds to the quality of our products.

Create and Maintain Diversity in Product Mix, Platforms, and Markets.

We believe that maintaining a diversified mix of
products can reduce our operating risks and enhance profitability. Therefore, we develop and publish products spanning a wide range of product categories, including action/adventure, action sports,
racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person action, music-based gaming, and strategy. We also develop products designed for target audiences ranging from casual players to game
enthusiasts, children to adults, and mass-market consumers to "value" buyers. Presently, we concentrate on developing, publishing, and distributing products that operate on the PS2, PS3,
Xbox360, and Wii


console
systems, PSP and NDS hand-held devices, and the PC. We typically offer our products for use on multiple platforms in order to reduce the risks associated with any single platform,
leverage our costs over a larger installed hardware base, and increase unit sales.

Continue to Improve Profitability.

We continually strive to manage risk and increase our operating leverage and efficiency
with the goal of increased profitability. We believe the key factor affecting our future profitability will be the success rate of our product releases. Therefore, our product selection and
development process includes, as a significant component, periodic evaluations of the expected commercial success of products under development. Through this process, for titles that we determine to
be less promising, corrections are made in the development process or, if necessary, they are discontinued before we incur additional development costs. In addition, we believe our focus on cross
platform releases and franchised products will contribute to improved profitability.

We
continue to focus on increasing our margins. We have, for example, acquired certain experienced and specialized developers in instances where we can enhance profitability through the
elimination of royalty obligations. Additionally, we often rely on independent third-party interactive entertainment software developers to develop some of our software products, thereby taking
advantage of specialized independent developers without incurring the fixed overhead obligations associated with increased internally employed staff.

Our
sales and marketing staff work with our studio resources to increase the visibility of new product launches and to coordinate the timing and promotion of product releases. Our
finance and sales and marketing personnel work together to improve inventory management and receivables collections. We have instituted broad, objective-based reward programs that provide incentives
to management and staff throughout the organization to produce results that meet our financial objectives.

Grow Through Continued Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances.

The interactive entertainment industry has been consolidating,
and we believe that success in this industry will be driven in part by the ability to take advantage of scale. Specifically, smaller companies are more capital constrained, enjoy less predictability
of revenues and cash flow, lack product diversity and must spread fixed costs over a smaller revenue base. Several industry leaders are emerging that combine the entrepreneurial and creative spirit of
the industry with professional management, the ability to access the capital markets, and the ability to maintain favorable relationships with developers, intellectual property owners, and retailers.
Through numerous completed acquisitions since 1997, we believe that we have successfully diversified our operations, channels of distribution, development talent pool, and library of titles, and we
have emerged as one of the industry's leaders. We intend to continue to evaluate the expansion of our resources through acquisitions, strategic relationships, and key license transactions. We intend
to continue expanding our intellectual property library through key license transactions and strategic relationships with intellectual property owners. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to
increase our development capacity through the acquisition of or investment in selected experienced software development firms.

Products

Historically, we have been best known for our action/adventure, strategy, and simulation products. We have been successful in the superheroes category with our
release of titles based on the Spider-Man and X-Men properties. We have also been successful in the first person action categories through the Call of Duty original
intellectual property, which we plan on continuing as a successful long-term franchise. Call of Duty has achieved over $1 billion life-to-date sales. In
fiscal 2007 we successfully entered the music-based gaming genre with the acquisition of the Guitar Hero franchise. This franchise combines interactive software with a hardware peripheral in the form
of a guitar. In fiscal 2008 the Guitar Hero franchise has set an industry record, surpassing $1 billion in North America retail sales in


26 months.
We have established ourselves as a leader in the "value" software publishing business with products under our Cabela's, Rapala, World Series of Poker, and Greg Hasting's Paintball
licenses, as well as with products distributed on behalf of our "value" affiliate label partners. Products published by us in this category are generally developed by third parties, often under
contract with us. Value software is typically less sophisticated and less complex, both in terms of the development process and consumer gameplay.

Hardware Licenses.

Our products currently are being developed or published primarily for the PS2, PS3, Wii, and Xbox360
console systems; PSP and NDS hand-held devices; and PCs. In order to maintain general access to the console systems and hand-held devices marketplace, we have maintained
licenses for the PS2, PS3, Wii, and Xbox360 console systems and PSP, and NDS hand-held devices with the owners of each such platform. Each license allows us to create multiple products for
the applicable platform, subject to certain approval rights which are reserved by each licensor. Each license also requires that we pay the licensor a per unit royalty for each unit manufactured. In
contrast, we are not required to obtain any license for the development and production of products for PCs.

Intellectual Property Rights.

Many of our current and planned releases are based on intellectual property, other character or
story rights, and music rights licensed from third parties, as well as a combination of characters, worlds, and concepts derived from our extensive library of titles, and original characters and
concepts owned and created by us. When publishing products based on licensed intellectual property rights, we generally seek to capitalize on the name recognition, marketing efforts, and goodwill
associated with the underlying property. For intellectual property owned by Activision, we generally attempt to establish such properties as sustainable, long-term game franchises.

In
acquiring intellectual property rights from third parties, we seek to obtain rights to publish titles across a variety of platforms, to include the ability to produce multiple titles
and to retain rights over an extended period of time. In past years, we have been able to enter into a series of long-term or multi-product agreements with owners of various intellectual
properties that are well known throughout the world and to create products based on these recognizable characters, story lines, or concepts. These agreements typically provide us with exclusive
publishing rights for a specific period of time and, in some cases, for specified platforms and, in other cases, with renewal rights upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The scope of our
licensing activities includes theatrical motion pictures, television shows, animated films and series, comic books, literary works, music, sports personalities and events, and celebrities. We intend
to continue expanding relationships with our existing intellectual property partners and to enter into agreements with other intellectual property owners for additional recognizable properties,
characters, story lines and concepts. However, we may not be able to maintain or expand our existing relationships or to seek out and sustain new long-term relationships of similar caliber
in the future.

Product Development and Support

We develop and produce titles using a model in which a core group of creative, production, and technical professionals, in coordination with our marketing and
finance departments, have responsibility for the entire development and production process including the supervision and coordination of internal and external resources. This team assembles the
necessary creative elements to complete a title using, where appropriate, outside programmers, artists, animators, scriptwriters, musicians and songwriters, sound effects and special effects experts,
and sound and video studios. We believe that this model allows us to supplement internal expertise with top quality external resources on an as-needed basis.

In
addition, we often seek out and engage independent third-party developers to create products on our behalf. Such products are sometimes owned by us, and usually we have unlimited
rights to commercially exploit these products. In other circumstances, the third-party developer may retain


ownership
of the intellectual property and/or technology included in the product and reserve certain exploitation rights. We typically select these independent third-party developers based on their
expertise in developing products in a specific category and use the same developer to produce the same game for multiple platforms. Each of our third-party developers is under contract with us for
specific or multiple titles. From time to time, we also acquire the license rights to publish and/or distribute software products that are or will be independently created by third-party developers.
In such cases, the agreements with such developers provide us with exclusive publishing and/or distribution rights for a specific period of time, often for specified platforms and territories. In
either case, we often have the ability to publish and/or distribute sequels, conversions, enhancements, and add-ons to the product initially being produced by the independent developer and
we frequently have the right to engage the services of the original developer with regard to the development of such products.

In
consideration for the services that the independent third-party developer provides, the developer receives a royalty generally based on net sales of the product that it has developed.
Typically, the developer also receives an advance, which we recoup from the royalties otherwise payable to the developer. The advance generally is paid in "milestone" stages. The payment at each stage
is tied to the completion and delivery of a detailed performance milestone. Some contracts include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are recorded as an asset when actually paid and as a
liability when incurred, rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract. Working with an independent developer allows us to reduce our fixed development costs, share
development risks with the third-party developer, take advantage of the third-party developer's expertise in connection with certain categories of products or certain platforms, and gain access to
proprietary development technologies.

"Greenlight Process"

We have adopted and implemented a rigorous procedure for the selection, development, production, and quality assurance of our internally and externally produced
interactive entertainment software titles. The process, known internally as the "Greenlight Process," involves several phases throughout the development and production and the post-release
review of a title, each of which includes a number of specific performance milestones. The phases of the "Greenlight Process" are the concept, developer selection, prototype, first playable, alpha,
and post-mortem. This procedure is designed to enable us to manage and control production and development budgets and timetables, to identify and address production and technical issues at
the earliest opportunity, and to coordinate marketing and quality control strategies throughout the production and development phases, all in an environment that fosters creativity. The
post-release review of a title is critical to provide feedback and ideas to our future development. Checks and balances are intended to be provided through the structured interaction of
the project team with our creative, technical, marketing, and quality assurance/customer support personnel, as well as our legal, accounting, and finance
departments. In order to maintain the competitiveness of our products and to take advantage of increasingly sophisticated technology associated with hardware platforms, our development process
includes a significant amount of time for play-testing new products, and extensive product quality evaluations.

Product Support

We provide various forms of product support to both our internally and externally developed titles. Our quality assurance personnel are involved throughout the
development and production of each title published by us. We subject all such products to extensive testing before release to ensure compatibility with all appropriate hardware systems and
configurations and to minimize the number of bugs and other defects found in the products. To support our products after release, we provide online access to our customers on a 24-hour
basis as well as telephone operator help lines during regular business


hours.
The customer support group tracks customer inquiries and we use this data to help improve the development and production processes.

Publishing Activities

Marketing

Our marketing efforts include online activities (such as the creation of World Wide Web pages to promote specific titles and build user communities around our
franchises), public relations, print and broadcast advertising, coordinated in-store and industry promotions (including merchandising and point of purchase displays), participation in
cooperative advertising programs, direct response vehicles, and product sampling through demonstration software distributed through the Internet or on compact discs. From time to time, we also receive
marketing support from hardware manufacturers and retailers in connection with their own promotional efforts. In addition, certain of our products contain software that enables customers to
"electronically register" their purchases with us online.

We
believe that certain of our franchises have loyal and devoted audiences who purchase our sequels as a result of dedication to the property and satisfaction from previous product
purchases. We therefore market these sequels both toward the established market as well as broader audiences. In addition, in marketing titles based on licensed properties, we believe that we derive
benefits from the continued exploitation of these licensed properties and the marketing and promotional activities of the property owners.

Sales and Distribution

North America.

Our products are available for sale or rental in thousands of retail outlets domestically. Our North American
customers include Best Buy, Blockbuster, Circuit City, GameStop, Target, Toys "R" Us, and Wal-Mart.

In
the United States and Canada, our products are sold primarily on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game
specialty stores. We believe that a direct relationship with retail accounts results in more effective inventory management, merchandising, and communications than would be possible through indirect
relationships. We have implemented electronic data interchange linkages with many of our retailers to facilitate the placing and shipping of orders. We sell our products to a limited number of
distributors.

International.

Our products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party
distribution and licensing arrangements, and through our wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries. We conduct our international publishing activities through offices in the United Kingdom,
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden, Australia, South Korea, and Japan. We seek to maximize our worldwide revenues and profits by releasing high quality foreign
language releases concurrently with English language releases and by continuing to expand the number of direct selling relationships we maintain with key retailers in major territories.

On
a worldwide basis, our largest customers, Wal-Mart and GameStop, accounted for approximately 14% and 13%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2008. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, our largest customers, Wal-Mart and GameStop, accounted for 22% and 8%, respectively, of consolidated net
revenues.

Affiliate Labels.

In addition to our own products, we distribute a select number of interactive entertainment products that
are developed and marketed by other third-party publishers through our "affiliate label" programs in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. The distribution of other publishers' products
allows us to increase the efficiencies of our sales force and provides us with the ability to better ensure adequate shelf presence at retail stores for all of the products that we distribute.
Distributing other publishers' titles mitigates the risk associated with a particular title or


titles
published by us failing to achieve expectations. Services provided by us under our affiliate label program include order solicitation, in-store marketing, logistics and order
fulfillment, sales channel management, as well as other accounting and general administrative functions. Our current affiliate label partners include LucasArts, as well as several affiliate label
partners in our "value" business. Each affiliate label relationship is unique and may pertain only to distribution in certain geographic territories such as the North America, Europe, or the Asia
Pacific region and may be further limited only to specific titles or titles for specific platforms.

See
Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for certain financial information
regarding reporting segments and geographic areas required by Item 1.

Distribution

We distribute interactive entertainment hardware and software products in Europe through our European distribution subsidiaries: Centresoft in the United Kingdom;
NBG in Germany; and CD Contact in the Benelux countries. These subsidiaries act as wholesalers in the distribution of products and also provide packaging and logistical and sales services. They
provide services to our publishing operations and to various third-party publishers, including Sony Computer Entertainment ("Sony"), Nintendo Co. Ltd. ("Nintendo"), and Microsoft
Corporation ("Microsoft"). Centresoft is Sony's exclusive distributor of PlayStation products to the independent channel in the United Kingdom. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, sales
for Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft accounted for approximately 29%, 5%, and 2%, respectively, of our worldwide distribution net revenues.

We
entered into the distribution business to obtain distribution capacity in Europe for our own products, while supporting the distribution infrastructure with third-party sales, and to
diversify our operations into the European market. Centresoft and our other distribution subsidiaries operate in accordance with strict confidentiality procedures in order to provide independent
services to various third-party publishers.

Emerging Technologies

We are actively supporting emerging platforms (wireless devices, digital downloads, and closed and open online networks) by publishing and licensing key
franchises for these emerging platforms. We have published and licensed rights to various franchises, such as the Call of Duty franchise, the Guitar Hero franchise,

Tony Hawk's
Project 8

, and

Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam

for various hand-held wireless devices. We also develop and optimize many of
our titles for consoles that support online play, such as PS2, Xbox Live on the Xbox360, and the Sony PS3 and Nintendo Wii consoles. We believe that more of our franchises can be successfully
published for wireless and online platforms, as well as exploited through other emerging technologies, as they continue to evolve.

In
addition, we derive revenue from in-game advertising consisting primarily of fixed product placement. We are developing and expanding on dynamic ad serving technology and
will continue to focus on attracting third parties to advertise in our video games.

Manufacturing

We prepare a set of master program copies, documentation, and packaging materials for our products for each hardware platform on which the product will be
released. We also manufacture separate hardware peripherals, such as the guitar in Guitar Hero. Except with respect to products for use on the Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft systems, our disk and
hardware peripheral's duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly, and shipping are performed by third-party subcontractors.


To maintain protection over their hardware technologies, Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft generally specify or control the manufacturing and assembly of finished products. We deliver the
master materials to the licensor or its approved replicator, which then manufactures finished goods and delivers them to us for distribution under our label. We use the manufacturers who are
authorized by Sony, Nintendo, or Microsoft to make the hardware peripheral for Guitar Hero. At the time our product unit orders are filled by the manufacturer, we become responsible for the costs of
manufacturing and the applicable per unit royalty on such units, even if the units do not ultimately sell.

To
date, we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the manufacture and assembly of our products or material returns due to product defects.

Competition

The interactive entertainment industry is intensely competitive and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly introduced. Our
competitors vary in size from small companies with limited resources to large corporations with greater financial, marketing, and product development resources than we have. Due to their different
focuses and allocation of resources, certain of our competitors spend more money and time on developing and testing products, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive
pricing policies, pay higher fees to licensors for desirable motion picture, television, sports and character properties, and pay more to third-party software developers. In addition, competitors with
large product lines and popular titles typically have greater leverage with retailers, distributors, and other customers who may be willing to promote titles with less consumer appeal in return for
access to such competitor's most popular titles. We believe that the main competitive factors in the interactive entertainment industry include: product features and playability; brand name
recognition; compatibility of products with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; quality of products; ease of use; price; marketing support; and quality of customer service.

We
compete primarily with other publishers of personal computer and video game console interactive entertainment software. Significant third-party software competitors currently include,
among others: Capcom Co. Ltd.; Eidos PLC; Electronic Arts Inc.; Konami Company Ltd.; Midway Games Inc.; Namco Bandai Games Ltd.; Sega
Enterprises, Ltd.; Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.; THQ Inc.; Ubisoft Entertainment; Viacom/MTV; Vivendi Games Publishing; Warner Bro's Interactive; and the Walt
Disney Company. In addition, integrated video game console hardware and software companies
such as Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms.

Employees

As of March 31, 2008, we had approximately 2,640 employees, including approximately 1,200 in product development, 500 in North American publishing, 500 in
international publishing, 170 in operations, corporate finance and administration, and 270 in European distribution activities.

As
of March 31, 2008, approximately 260 of our full-time employees were subject to term employment agreements with us. These agreements generally commit such employees
to employment terms of between one and five years from the commencement of their respective agreements. Most of the employees subject to such agreements are executive officers or key members of the
product development, sales, or marketing divisions. These individuals perform services for us as executives, directors, producers, associate producers, computer programmers, game designers, sales
directors, and marketing product managers. The execution by us of employment agreements with such employees, in our experience, reduces our turnover during the development, production, and
distribution phases of our entertainment software products and allows us to plan more effectively for future development and marketing activities.


None
of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement except for the employees of our German distribution subsidiary who are allowed by German law to belong to an
organized labor council. To date, we have not experienced any labor-related work stoppages.

Item 1A.    RISK FACTORS

Our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance. If any of the events or circumstances described below
occurs, our business and financial performance could be harmed, our actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and the market value of our securities could decline. The risks
discussed below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks exist that we do not currently believe to be material, and there may also be other risks that are not currently known to us, that may
also harm our business and adversely affect our future financial performance and the market value of our stock.

Risks Factors Relating to the Interactive Entertainment Industry and Our Business

We depend on a relatively small number of franchises for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.

A significant portion of our revenues is derived from products based on a relatively small number of popular franchises each year, and these products are
responsible for a disproportionate amount of our profits. In addition, many of these products have substantial production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets. In fiscal 2008, 65% of our
consolidated net revenues and 75% of our worldwide publishing net revenues were derived from three franchises and in fiscal 2007, 39% of our consolidated net revenues and 52% of our worldwide
publishing net revenues were derived from three franchises. We expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately large amount of our revenues and
profits. Due to this dependence on a limited number of franchises, the failure to achieve anticipated results by one or more products based on these franchises may significantly harm our business and
financial results.

Our future success depends on our ability to release popular products.

The life of any one console or handheld game product is relatively short and generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after
introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales. Because revenues associated with an initial product launch generally constitute a high percentage of the total revenues associated with the life of a
product, delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cause such operating
results to be materially different from expectations. It is therefore important for us to be able to continue to develop many high quality new products that are popularly received. We focus our
development and publishing activities principally on


products
that are, or have the potential to become, franchise brand properties. If we are unable to do this, our business and financial results may be negatively affected.

Our business is "hit" driven. If we do not deliver "hit" titles, or if consumers prefer competing products, our sales could suffer.

While many new products are regularly introduced, only a relatively small number of "hit" titles account for a significant portion of net revenues. Competitors
may develop titles that imitate or compete with our "hit" titles, and take sales away from us or reduce our ability to command premium prices for those titles. Hit products published by our
competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than anticipated, which could cause our product sales to fall below expectations. If our competitors develop more successful products or offer
competitive products at lower prices, or if we do not continue to develop consistently high-quality and well received products, our revenue, margins, and profitability will decline.

If we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to intellectual property, we may publish fewer "hit" titles and our revenue may decline.

Some of our products are based on intellectual property and other character or story rights acquired or licensed from third parties. These license and
distribution agreements are limited in scope and time, and we may not be able to renew key licenses when they expire or to include new products in existing licenses. The loss of a significant number
of our intellectual property licenses or of our relationships with licensors, or our inability to obtain additional licenses of significant commercial value could have a material adverse effect on our
ability to develop new products and therefore on our business and
financial results. Additionally, the failure of intellectual property acquired by us to be popularly received could impact the market acceptance of those products in which the intellectual property is
included. Such lack of market acceptance could result in the write-off of the unrecovered portion of acquired intellectual property assets, which could cause material harm to our business
and financial results. Furthermore, the competition for these licenses and distribution agreements is often intense. Competition for these licenses may also increase the advances, guarantees, and
royalties that we must pay to the licensor.

Our business is highly dependent on the success, timely release and availability of new video game platforms, on the continued availability of existing
video game platforms, as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms.

We derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured by third parties, such as Sony's PlayStation 2, PlayStation
3 and PlayStation Portable, Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii and DS. The success of our business is driven in large part by the availability of an adequate supply of these video game
platforms, our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace, and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms. We must make
product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform. A new platform for which we are developing products may be delayed,
may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated. Alternatively, a platform for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than initially anticipated,
causing us to miss a meaningful revenue opportunity. Additionally, if the platforms for which we are developing products are not released when anticipated, are not available in adequate quantities to
meet consumer demand, or do not attain wide market acceptance, our revenue may suffer, we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing those products, and our financial
performance may be harmed.


Transitions in console platforms could have a material impact on the market for interactive entertainment software.

In 2005, Microsoft released the Xbox 360 and, in 2006, Sony and Nintendo introduced their respective next-generation hardware platforms, the
PlayStation 3 and Wii. When new console platforms are announced or introduced into the market, consumers typically reduce their purchases of game console entertainment software products for current
console platforms in anticipation of new platforms becoming available. During these periods, sales of our game console entertainment software products may be expected to slow or even decline until new
platforms are introduced and achieve wide consumer acceptance. This decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new console platforms. As console hardware moves through its life
cycle, hardware manufacturers typically enact
price reductions and decreasing prices may put downward pressure on software prices. During platform transitions, we may simultaneously incur costs both in continuing to develop and market new titles
for prior-generation video game platforms, which may not sell at premium prices, and also in developing products for next-generation platforms, which will not generate
immediate or near-term revenue. As a result, our operating results during platform transitions may be more volatile and more difficult to predict than during other times, and such
volatility may cause greater fluctuations in our stock price.

We must make significant expenditures to develop products for new platforms which may not be successful.

We must make substantial product development and other investments in a particular platform well in advance of introduction of the platform and may be required to
realign our product portfolio and development efforts in response to market changes. Furthermore, development costs for new console platforms are greater than such costs for current console platforms.
If increased costs are not offset by higher revenues and other cost efficiencies, our operating results will suffer and our financial position will be harmed. If the platforms for which we develop new
software products or modify existing products do not attain significant market penetration, we may not be able to recover our development costs, which could be significant, and our business and
financial results could be significantly harmed.

If the average price of prior-generation titles continues to decline or if we are unable to sustain launch pricing on
next-generation titles, our operating results will suffer.

We have experienced a decrease in the average price of titles for prior-generation platforms. With the transition of the interactive entertainment
industry to next-generation video game platforms, fewer prior-generation titles are able to command premium prices, and we expect that even those titles that can do so will be
subject to price reductions at an earlier point in their sales cycle than was the case with prior platform transitions. We expect the average price of prior-generation titles to continue
to be under pressure, which may have a negative effect on our margins and operating results.

Next-generation
titles for the Xbox 360, Sony's PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Wii have been offered at premium retail prices since the launch of such consoles. We
expect to continue to price next-generation titles at a premium level, but if we are unable to sustain launch pricing on these next-generation titles we may experience a
negative effect on our margins and operating results.

The interactive entertainment industry is highly competitive and our competitors may succeed in narrowing our market share and reducing our sales.

We compete with other publishers of PC and video game console interactive entertainment software and peripherals. Those competitors vary in size from small
companies with limited resources to very large corporations with significantly greater financial, marketing, and product development resources than we have. For example, integrated video game console
hardware and software companies such as Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft compete directly with us in the development of software titles


for
their respective platforms. Certain of these competitors may spend more money and time on developing and testing products, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive
pricing policies, pay higher fees to licensors for desirable motion picture, television, sports, music and character properties, and pay more to third-party software developers than we do.

We
also compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities. For example, the overall growth in the use of the Internet and online services by consumers may pose a
competitive threat if customers and potential customers spend less of their available time using interactive entertainment software and more using the Internet and online services. A number of
software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games for use by consumers over the Internet. Future increased consumer acceptance and
increases in the availability of online games or technological advances in online game software or the Internet could result in a decline in platform-based software and negatively impact
sales of our console and handheld products. Direct sales of software over the Internet by competitors could materially adversely affect our distribution business as well.

Competition
in the interactive entertainment industry is intense and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge.

Our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of and have broad approval rights over our console and
handheld video game products.

Generally, when we develop interactive entertainment software products for hardware platforms offered by Sony, Nintendo, or Microsoft, the products are
manufactured exclusively by that hardware manufacturer or their approved replicator.

The
agreements with these manufacturers include certain provisions, such as approval rights over all software products and related hardware peripherals and promotional materials and the
ability to
change the fee they charge for the manufacturing of products, which allow them substantial influence over the cost and the release schedule of such interactive entertainment software products. In
addition, since each of the manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware platforms and manufactures products for all of its other licensees, a manufacturer may give priority to its
own products or those of our competitors in the event of insufficient manufacturing capacity. Accordingly, Sony, Nintendo, or Microsoft could cause unanticipated delays in the release of our products
as well as increases to our projected development, manufacturing, marketing, or distribution costs, which could materially harm our business and financial results.

In
addition, platform licensors control our ability to provide online game capabilities for console platform products and in large part establish the financial terms on which these
services are offered to consumers. Currently, Microsoft provides online capabilities for the Xbox 360 and Sony provides online capabilities for PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 products. In each
case, compatibility code and/or the consent of the licensor are required for us to include online capabilities in our console products. As these capabilities become more significant, the failure or
refusal of licensors to approve our products may harm our business and financial results.

Our platform licensors set the royalty rates and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their platforms, and therefore have significant
influence on our costs.

We pay a licensing fee to the hardware manufacturer for each copy of a product manufactured for that manufacturer's game platform. In order to publish products
for new hardware platforms, we must take a license from the platform licensor which gives the platform licensor the opportunity to set the fee structure that we must pay in order to publish games for
that platform. Similarly, the platform licensors have retained the flexibility to change their fee structures for online gameplay and features for their consoles and the manufacturing of products. The
control that platform licensors have over the fee


structures
for their platforms and online access makes it difficult for us to predict our costs and profitability in the medium to long term. It is also possible that platform licensors will not renew
our existing licenses. Because publishing products for console systems is the largest portion of our business, any increase in fee structures or nonrenewal of licenses could have a significant
negative impact on our business model and profitability.

We rely on independent third parties to develop some of our software products.

We rely on independent third-party software developers to develop some of our software products. Since we depend on these developers, in the
aggregate, we remain subject to the following risks:

•

continuing
strong demand for developers' resources, combined with the recognition they receive in connection with their work, may cause developers who worked for us in the
past either to work for a competitor in the future or to renegotiate our agreements with them on terms less favorable for us;

•

limited
financial resources and business expertise and inability to retain skilled personnel may force developers out of business prior to completing products or require us
to fund additional costs; and

•

our
competitors may acquire the businesses of key developers or sign them to exclusive development arrangements. In either case, we would not be able to continue to engage
such developers' services for our products, except for those that they are contractually obligated to complete development of for us.

Increased
competition for skilled third-party software developers also has compelled us to agree to make significant advance payments on royalties to game developers. If the
products subject to these arrangements do not generate sufficient revenues to recover these royalty advances, we would have to write-off unrecovered portions of these payments, which could
cause material harm to our business and financial results. Typically, we pay developers a royalty based on a percentage of net revenues, less agreed upon deductions, but from time to time, we have
agreed to pay developers fixed per unit product royalties after royalty advances are fully recouped. To the extent that sales prices of products on which we have agreed to pay a fixed per unit royalty
are marked down, our profitability could be adversely affected.

If our products contain defects, our business could be harmed significantly.

Software products and hardware peripherals as complex as the ones we publish and distribute may contain undetected errors and defects. This risk is often higher
when such products or peripherals are first introduced or when new versions are released. Failure to avoid, or to timely detect and correct, such errors or defects could result in loss of, or delay
in, market acceptance, and could significantly harm our business, financial results, and reputation.

We may permit our customers to return products and to receive pricing concessions which could reduce our net revenues and results of operations.

We are exposed to the risk of product returns and price protection with respect to our distributors and retailers. Return policies allow distributors and
retailers to return defective, shelf-worn, and damaged products in accordance with terms granted. Price protection, when granted and applicable, allows customers a credit against amounts
owed to us with respect to merchandise unsold by them. We may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. These conditions include compliance
with applicable payment terms, delivery of weekly inventory and sell-through reports, and consistent participation in the launches of our premium title releases. We may also consider other
factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market factors.


When
we offer price protection, we offer it with respect to a particular product to all of our retail customers (although only customers who meet the conditions detailed above are entitled to such
price protection). We also offer a 90-day limited warranty to our end users that our products will be free from manufacturing defects. Although we maintain a reserve for returns and price
protection, and although we may place limits on product returns and price protection, we could be forced to accept substantial product returns and provide substantial price protection to maintain our
relationships with retailers and our access to distribution channels. Product returns and price protection that exceed our reserves could significantly harm our business and financial results.

Sales of certain titles such as Guitar Hero are affected by hardware peripheral availability.

Some of our titles involve one or more separate hardware peripherals, such as the guitar controller in

Guitar
Hero

. Typically, we sell such software both in bundles with the hardware peripheral and on a stand-alone basis. Consumers may not want to buy such game software if
they cannot also buy the hardware peripheral. If we underestimate demand or otherwise are unable to produce sufficient quantities of the hardware peripheral of an acceptable quality or allocate too
few peripherals to geographic markets and hardware platforms where demand exceeds supply, we will forego revenue. This may also create greater opportunities for competitors to develop or gain market
share with competitive product offerings. If we overestimate demand and make too many peripherals, or allocate too many peripherals to geographic markets and hardware platforms where there is
insufficient demand, we will incur unrecoverable manufacturing costs for unsold units as well as for unsold game software. In either case, hardware peripheral manufacturing and allocation decisions
may negatively affect our financial performance.

A
limited number of manufacturers are authorized by Sony, Nintendo or Microsoft to make the hardware peripherals for

Guitar Hero

, and the
majority of those manufacturers are located in China. Anything that adversely impacts the ability of those manufacturers to produce or otherwise supply the hardware peripherals for us, including the
revocation of the first-party license to
produce the hardware, the utilization of such manufacturer's capacity by one of our competitors, natural disasters that disrupt manufacturing, transportation or communications, labor shortages, civil
unrest or issues generally negatively impacting international companies operating in China, may adversely impact our ability to supply those peripherals to the market.

We may face difficulty obtaining access to retail shelf space necessary to market and sell our products effectively.

Retailers typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources, and there is intense competition among consumer interactive entertainment
software products for high quality retail shelf space and promotional support from retailers. To the extent that the number of products and platforms increases, competition for shelf space may
intensify and may require us to increase our marketing expenditures. Retailers with limited shelf space typically devote the most and highest quality shelf space to those products expected to be best
sellers. We cannot be certain that our new products will consistently achieve such "best seller" status. Due to increased competition for limited shelf space, retailers and distributors are in an
increasingly better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale, including price discounts, price protection, marketing and display fees, and product return policies. Our products constitute a
relatively small percentage of any retailer's sales volume. We cannot be certain that retailers will continue to purchase our products or to provide those products with adequate levels of shelf space
and promotional support on acceptable terms. A prolonged failure in this regard may significantly harm our business and financial results.


Our sales may decline substantially without warning and in a brief period of time because a majority of our sales are made to a relatively small number
of key customers and because we do not have long-term contracts for the sale of our products.

In the United States and Canada, we primarily sell our products on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount
warehouses, and game specialty stores. Our products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party distribution and licensing
arrangements and through our wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries. Our sales are made primarily on a purchase order basis without long-term agreements or other forms
of commitments. Our largest customers, Wal-Mart and GameStop, accounted for approximately 14% and 13%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2008 and approximately 22% and 8%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to,
any of our principal retail customers or distributors could significantly harm our business and financial results. The concentration of sales in a small number of large customers also could make us
more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more
of these large customers became unable to pay for our products. In addition, having such a large portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with
these customers.

We may be burdened with payment defaults and uncollectible accounts if our distributors or retailers cannot honor their existing credit arrangements.

Distributors and retailers in the interactive entertainment industry have from time to time experienced significant fluctuations in their businesses and a number
of them have failed. The insolvency or business failure of any significant retailer or distributor of our products could materially harm our business and financial results. We typically make sales to
most such retailers and some such distributors on unsecured credit, with terms that vary depending upon the customer's credit history, solvency, credit limits, and sales history, as well as whether we
can obtain sufficient credit insurance. Although, as in the case with most of our customers, we have insolvency risk insurance to protect against a customer's bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation,
this insurance contains a significant deductible and co-payment obligation, and does not cover all instances of non-payment. In addition, although we maintain a reserve for
uncollectible receivables, the reserve may not be sufficient in every circumstance. As a result, a payment default by a significant customer could significantly harm our business and financial
results.

We may not be able to maintain our distribution relationships with key vendors and customers.

Our CD Contact, NBG, and Centresoft subsidiaries distribute interactive entertainment software and hardware products and provide related services in the Benelux
countries, Germany, and the United Kingdom, respectively, and via export in other European countries for a variety of entertainment software publishers, many of which are our competitors, and hardware
manufacturers. From time to time, they also maintain exclusive relationships to serve certain retail customers. These services are generally performed subject to limited-term arrangements.
Although we expect to use reasonable efforts to retain these vendors and retail customer relationships, we may not be successful in this regard. The cancellation or non-renewal of one or
more of these arrangements could adversely affect business and financial results.

Our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry, any of which could significantly harm our operating results.

Our business is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment industry, including the popularity, price and timing of the release of our
games and the platforms on which they are played; economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending; changes in consumer demographics; the availability and popularity of other
forms of entertainment; and critical


reviews
and public tastes and preferences, which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted. Many of these risks are beyond our control. These risks could negatively impact our business
and financial results.

As online functionality becomes an increasingly important feature of our software products, we may need to defer the recognition of an increasing amount
of revenue, which may adversely affect the net revenue, net income and earnings per share that we will report under GAAP.

As online functionality becomes a more important component of gameplay, an increasing number of our online-enabled games may contain a
more-than-inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product, and our performance obligations for these games will extend beyond the sale of the games.
Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the online services, as we do not plan to separately charge for this component of online-enabled games. As a
result, for certain key titles to be released in the December quarter of fiscal year 2009 and thereafter, we will recognize all of the revenues from the sale of certain online-enabled
games for certain platforms ratably over an estimated service period, which we currently estimate to be six months beginning the month after shipment. In addition, we will defer the costs of sales of
those titles. This may have an adverse effect on the revenue, net income and earnings per share that we will report for future periods under GAAP. If we are required to recognize a greater portion of
the revenue of a sale after shipment, or if we are required to recognize revenue over a longer service period, there may be an adverse effect on our reported net revenue, net income and earnings per
share under GAAP.

We are exposed to seasonality in the sale of our products.

The interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the calendar year end holiday buying
season. As a result, net revenues, gross profits, and operating income have historically been highest during the second half of the calendar year. Our receivables and credit risk are likewise higher
during the second half of the calendar year as customers stock up on our products for the holiday season. Further, delays in development, licensor approvals, or
manufacturing can also affect the timing of the release of our products, causing us to miss key selling periods such as the calendar year end holiday buying season.

We may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand.

A significant portion of our selling and general and administrative expense is comprised of personnel and facilities. In the event of a significant decline in
revenues, we may not be able to exit facilities, reduce personnel, or make other changes to our cost structure without disruption to operations or without significant termination and exit costs.
Management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner, if at all, to offset an immediate shortfall in revenues and profit.

If we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel, we will be unable to effectively conduct our business.

Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify, hire, and retain skilled personnel. The software industry is characterized by a high level
of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors for personnel with technical, marketing, sales, product development, and management skills. We may have difficulties in attracting and
retaining skilled personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do so. If we are unable to attract additional qualified employees or retain the services of key personnel, our business and
financial results could be negatively impacted.


Our products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying, and inadequate intellectual property laws and other protections could prevent
us from enforcing or defending our proprietary technologies. We may also face legal risks arising out of user-generated content.

We regard our software as proprietary and rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, employee and third-party
nondisclosure agreements, and other methods to protect our proprietary rights. We own or license various copyrights, patents, and trademarks. We are aware that some unauthorized copying occurs, and if
a significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our software products were to occur, it could cause material harm to our business and financial results.

Policing
unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and software piracy is a persistent problem, especially in certain countries. Further, the laws of some countries where our
products are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or are poorly enforced. Legal protection of
our rights may be ineffective in such countries. In addition, though we take steps to make the unauthorized copying and distribution of our products more difficult, as do the manufacturers of consoles
on which the majority of our games are played, our efforts and those of the console manufacturers may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products. Organized pirate operations have been
expanding globally. In addition, the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used in our products, the availability of broadband access to the Internet, the ability
to download pirated copies of our games from various Internet sites and peer-to-peer networks, and the widespread proliferation of Internet cafes using pirated copies of our
products, all have contributed to an expansion in piracy. This could have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future.

Moreover,
as we leverage our software products using technologies such as the Internet and online services, and as user-generated content increases, our ability to protect
our intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others may diminish. We cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate
protection for our products in connection with these emerging technologies.

Data breaches involving the source code for our products or customer or employee data we store could adversely affect our reputation and revenue.

We store the source code for our interactive entertainment software products as it is created on multiple electronic devices. In addition, we store confidential
information with respect to our customers and employees. A breach of the systems on which such source code, account information (including personally identifiable information) and other sensitive data
is stored could lead to piracy of our software or fraudulent activity resulting in claims and lawsuits against us in connection with data security breaches. If we are subject to data security
breaches, we may have a loss in sales or be forced to pay damages or other amounts, which could materially and adversely affect profitability. In addition, any damage to our reputation resulting from
a data breach could have a material adverse impact on either revenue and future growth prospects, or increased costs arising from the implementation of additional security measures.

We may be subject to intellectual property claims.

As the number of interactive entertainment software products increases and the features and content of these products continue to overlap, software developers
increasingly may become subject to infringement claims. Many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on real world examples, which may be the subject of intellectual
property infringement claims of others. In addition, our products often utilize complex, cutting edge technology that may become subject to emerging intellectual property rights of others. Although we
believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others, it is possible that third


parties
still may claim infringement. From time to time, we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid or not,
may be time consuming, distracting to management and expensive to defend.

Intellectual
property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:

•

cease
selling, incorporating, or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;

•

obtain
a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which if available at all, may not be available on commercially favorable terms; or

•

redesign
the affected interactive entertainment software products or hardware peripherals, which could result in additional costs, delay introduction and possibly reduce
commercial appeal of the affected products.

Any
of these actions may cause material harm to our business and financial results.

Our products are subject to ratings by the Entertainment Software Rating Board and similar agencies. Failure to obtain our target ratings for our
products could negatively impact our sales.

The Entertainment Software Rating Board, or ESRB, is a self-regulatory body in the U.S. which provides consumers of interactive entertainment software
with ratings information, including information relating to violence, nudity, or sexual content contained in software titles. Certain countries other than the U.S. have also established similar rating
systems as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. In some instances, we may be required to modify our products to comply with the requirements of the rating systems, which could delay or
disrupt the release of any given product, or may prevent its sale altogether in certain territories. The relevant ESRB ratings include "Everyone" (age 6 and older), "Everyone 10+" (age 10 and older),
"Teen" (age 13 and over), or "Mature" (age 17 and over). Certain of our titles have received a "Mature" rating. None of our titles has received the "Adults Only" rating (18 and over). We believe that
we comply with rating systems and properly display the ratings and content descriptions received for our titles. If we are unable to obtain the ratings we have targeted for our products as a result of
changes in the ESRB's ratings standards or for other reasons, including the adoption of legislation in this area, our business and prospects could be negatively affected.

Our business, products, and distribution are subject to increasing regulation of content in key territories. If we do not successfully respond to these
regulations, our business may suffer.

Legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the content and the distribution of our products. For example, privacy laws in the United States
and Europe impose various restrictions on the collection and storage of personal information. Those laws and regulations vary by territory. In addition, many foreign countries have laws that permit
governmental entities to censor the content and/or advertising of interactive entertainment software. Other countries, such as Germany, prohibit certain types of content.

In
the United States, numerous laws have been introduced at the federal and state level which attempt to restrict the content of games or the distribution of such products. For example,
legislation has been adopted in several states, and proposed at the federal level, that prohibits the sale of certain games (

e.g.,

violent games
or those with "M (Mature)" or "AO (Adults Only)" ratings) to minors. In addition, a number of state legislative bodies in states such as Illinois, California, Michigan, and Washington have introduced
various forms of legislation designed to regulate and control sales of video games deemed inappropriate for sales to minors. Some argue that there is a link between video games and violence, which may
lead to increased pressure for legislative activity. To date, most courts that have ruled on such legislation have ruled in a manner favorable to the interactive entertainment industry. But in the
event such legislation is adopted and enforced, the sales of our products may be


harmed
because the products we are able to offer to our customers and the size of the potential market for our products may be limited. We may also be required to modify certain products or alter our
marketing strategies to comply with new and possibly inconsistent regulations, which could be costly or delay the release of our products.

If one or more of our titles were found to contain objectionable undisclosed content, our business could suffer.

Throughout the history of the interactive entertainment industry, many video games have been designed to include certain hidden content and gameplay features that
are accessible through the use of in-game cheat codes or other technological means that are intended to enhance the gameplay experience. However, in some cases, undisclosed content or
features have been found in other publishers' interactive entertainment software products. In a few cases, the ESRB has reacted to discoveries of undisclosed content and features by changing the
rating that was originally assigned to the product, requiring the publisher to change the game and/or game packaging and/or fining the publisher. Retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of
such undisclosed content by removing these games from their shelves, refusing to sell them, and demanding that their publishers accept them as product returns. Likewise, interactive entertainment
software consumers have reacted to the revelation of undisclosed content by refusing to purchase such games, demanding refunds for games they have already purchased, refraining from buying other games
published by the company whose game contained the objectionable material, and, in at least one occasion, filing a lawsuit against the publisher of the product containing such content.

We
have implemented preventive measures designed to reduce the possibility of objectionable undisclosed content from appearing in the video games we publish. Nonetheless, these
preventive measures are subject to human error, circumvention, overriding, and reasonable resource constraints. If a video game we published were found to contain undisclosed content, the ESRB could
demand that the game be recalled and its packaging changed to reflect a revised rating, retailers could refuse to sell it and demand the acceptance of returns of any unsold copies or returns from
customers, and/or consumers could refuse to buy it, demand refunds or file lawsuits against us. This could have a material negative impact on operating results and financial condition. In addition,
our reputation could be harmed, which could impact sales of our other video games. If any of these consequences were to occur, our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed.

Our products may be subject to legal claims.

In prior fiscal years, at least two lawsuits have been filed against numerous video game companies, including against us, by the families of victims who were shot
and killed by teenage gunmen in attacks perpetrated at schools. These lawsuits alleged that the video game companies manufactured and/or supplied these teenagers with violent video games, teaching
them how to use a gun and causing them to act out in a violent manner. These lawsuits have been dismissed. Similar additional lawsuits may be filed in the future. Although, our general liability
insurance carrier agreed to defend prior lawsuits of this nature against us, it is uncertain whether our insurance carrier would do so in the future, or if such insurance carriers would cover all or
any amounts for which we might be liable if such future lawsuits are not decided in our favor. If such future lawsuits are filed and ultimately decided against us and our insurance carrier does not
cover the amounts for which we may be liable, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Payment of significant claims by insurance carriers may make such insurance
coverage materially more expensive or unavailable in the future, thereby exposing us to additional risk.

Our business is subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade.

We conduct business throughout the world, and derive a substantial amount of revenue from international trade, particularly from Europe and Australia. Revenues
outside of North America have accounted for 39%, 50% and 52% of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,


respectively.
We expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues in the future.

We
are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased tariffs and duties, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, shipping delays, and international political,
regulatory and economic developments, all of which may impact our operating margins or make it more difficult, if not impossible, for us to conduct business in foreign markets.

For
example, a deterioration in relations between the U.S. and any country in which we have significant operations or sales could result in the adoption or expansion of trade
restrictions that harm our business and operating results, as could the implementation of government regulations in a country in which we have significant operations or sales.

If
government regulations or restrictions prevent us from repatriating internationally derived revenue into the U.S., or a country's tax structure makes repatriation prohibitively
expensive, we may not transfer this revenue into the U.S., which could affect our ability to reinvest or utilize such amounts in our business.

In
addition, cultural differences may affect consumer preferences and limit the popularity of titles that are "hits" in the United States. If we do not correctly assess consumer
preferences in the countries in our market, our sales and revenue may be lower than expected.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a negative impact on our business.

We transact business in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar and have significant international sales and expenses denominated in currencies other than
the U.S. dollar, subjecting us to currency exchange rate risks. We have engaged in limited currency hedging activities and, while these hedging activities mitigate some currency exchange rate risks,
our reported revenues from international sales and licensing, and thus our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected by unfavorable movements in currency exchange
rates.

Other Risks Relating to Our Business and Ownership of Our Stock

We seek to manage our business with a view to achieving long-term results, and this could have a negative effect on short-term
trading.

We focus on creation of shareholder value over time, and we intend to make decisions that will be consistent with this long-term view. As a result,
some of our decisions, such as whether to make or discontinue operating investments, manage our balance sheet and capital structure, or pursue or discontinue strategic initiatives, may be in conflict
with the objectives of short-term traders. Further, this could adversely affect our quarterly or other short-term results of operations.

We may face limitations on our ability to find suitable acquisition opportunities or to integrate additional acquired businesses.

We intend to pursue additional acquisitions of companies, properties, and other assets that can be purchased or licensed on acceptable terms and which we believe
can be operated or exploited profitably. Some of these transactions could be material in size and scope. Although we continue to search for additional acquisition opportunities, we may not be
successful in identifying suitable acquisitions. As the interactive entertainment software industry continues to consolidate, we face significant competition in seeking and consummating acquisition
opportunities. We may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or an acquisition may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings. In the future, we may issue
additional shares of our common stock in connection with one or more acquisitions, which may dilute our existing shareholders. Future acquisitions could also divert substantial management time and
result in short-term reductions in earnings or special transaction, ongoing goodwill amortization or other charges . In addition, we cannot


guarantee
that we will be able to successfully integrate the businesses that we may acquire into our existing business. Our shareholders may not have the opportunity to review, vote on, or evaluate
future acquisitions.

From
time to time, we may make a capital investment and hold a minority interest in a third-party developer in connection with interactive entertainment software products to be developed
by such developer for us, which we believe helps to create a closer relationship between us and the developer. We account for those capital investments over which we have the ability to exercise
significant influence using the equity method. For those investments over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, we account for our investment using the cost method. There
can be no assurance that we will realize long-term benefits from such investments or that we will continue to carry such investments at their current value.

Our shareholder rights plan, charter documents, and other agreements may make it more difficult to acquire us without the approval of our Board of
Directors.

We have adopted a shareholder rights plan under which one right entitles the holder to purchase one six-hundredths of a share of our Series A
Junior Preferred Stock, as adjusted on account of stock dividends made since the plan's adoption (as so adjusted, one-hundredths (1/100) of a share), at an exercise price of $6.67 per
share, as adjusted on account of stock dividends made since the plan's adoption (as so adjusted, $1.11 per share) is attached to each outstanding share of common stock. Such rights only become
exercisable if a person or group acquires 15% or more of our common stock (or announces or commences an offer which would result in their owning 15% of the stock) and if such an acquisition occurs,
generally each holder of a right may exercise that right for a number of shares of our common stock having a value equal to two times the then-current exercise price of the right
(which would currently be $2.22) in lieu of shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock. This plan therefore makes an acquisition of control in a transaction not approved by our Board of
Directors more difficult. The rights plan was amended in connection with the proposed transaction with Vivendi to provide that such transaction will not trigger the rights under the plan and will
terminate if and when the transaction is consummated, extinguishing all rights thereunder. However, until such time as the transaction closes the rights plan continues to make it difficult for a
company to acquire us without approval of our Board of Directors. In addition, our Amended and Restated By-laws have advance notice provisions for nominations for election of nominees to
the Board of Directors which may make it more difficult to acquire control of us. Our long-term incentive plans provide, in the discretion of a committee, for acceleration of stock options
following a change in control under certain circumstances, which has the effect of making an acquisition of control more expensive. In addition, some of our officers have severance compensation
agreements that provide for substantial cash payments or the acceleration of other benefits in the event of a change in control. These agreements and arrangements may also inhibit a change in control.

Historically, our stock price has been highly volatile.

The trading price of our common stock has been and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, including:

•

quarter
to quarter variations in our results of operations;

•

our
announcements of new products;

•

our
competitors' announcements of new products;

•

our
product development or release schedule;

•

general
conditions in the computer, software, entertainment, media or electronics industries, and in the economy;


•

the
timing of the introduction of new platforms and delays in the actual release of new platforms;

•

our
hardware manufacturers' announcements of price changes in hardware platforms;

•

consumer
spending trends;

•

the
outcome of lawsuits or regulatory investigations in which we are involved;

•

changes
in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts; and

•

investor
perceptions and expectations regarding products, plans and strategic position, and those of our competitors and customers.

In
addition, the public stock markets may experience extreme price and trading volume volatility, particularly in high technology sectors of the market. This volatility has significantly
affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely
affect the market price of our common stock.

Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in various other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision
for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are required to estimate future taxes.
Although we currently believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the estimate process is inherently uncertain, and such estimates are not binding on tax authorities. Our effective tax rate could be
adversely affected by changes in our business, including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our tax elections, changes in applicable tax laws as well as
other factors. Further, tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision. Should our ultimate tax
liability exceed estimates, our income tax provision and net income could be materially affected.

We
are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and
various other jurisdictions. Tax authorities regularly examine these non-income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations, changes in our business or
changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

SEC investigation and litigation relating to stock options remain pending and may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Although the special subcommittee of independent members of our board of directors established in July 2006 to review our historical stock option granting
practices, which we refer to as the special subcommittee, has completed its review of those practices and our stock option grants made in the period between 1992 and 2006, and although we have made to
the SEC Staff an offer of settlement of the SEC's formal investigation relating to our stock option granting practices, which the SEC Staff has indicated it is prepared to recommend to the SEC, and
have agreed to a settlement of the derivative litigation against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers, the settlement with the SEC remains subject to final documentation and
then approval by the Commission and the settlement of the derivative litigation remain subject to final court approval. We believe that we have taken appropriate action by restating our financial
statements through the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, as filed in our amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A on May 25, 2007, and made appropriate disclosures for matters
relating to stock options. If, however, the pending settlements are not approved,


the
SEC could institute enforcement action seeking other or additional relief or the court in the derivative actions could make findings disagreeing with the findings of the special subcommittee or
with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported, or not reported, the financial impact of past option grant measurement date errors. If so, we could be required to further restate our
prior financial statements, further amend our filings with the SEC, or take other actions not currently contemplated. In addition, additional proceedings would be likely to result in additional legal
expense that may affect our results in future periods, and may also result in diversion of management attention and other resources, as well as fines, penalties, damages and other sanctions against
the company or individual directors and officers. These eventualities could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We cannot currently predict the ultimate outcome of
these proceedings.

Our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that may have an adverse effect on our liquidity.

As of March 31, 2008, the par value of our investment in auction rate securities was $95.2 million, or approximately 6%, of our cash, cash
equivalents and investments, and the fair value of these securities was estimated to be $90.9 million, or $4.3 million below par. The change in fair value was recorded as a component of
comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders' equity, as the decline in fair value is not considered to be "other-than-temporary". The
auction rate securities we currently hold are all long term debt obligations secured by student loans, and they carry a "AAA" credit rating—the highest rating given to
securities—by a nationally recognized rating agency.

Liquidity
for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at
pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. Each of the auction rate securities in our investment portfolio as of March 31, 2008 has experienced a failed auction.
There is no assurance that future auctions for these securities will succeed. An auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of
buyers. In the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for
other types of similar short-term instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to earn interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every 7 to
35 days until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities or they mature. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in
the near term may be limited or not exist. All of our investments were classified as short-term as of December 31, 2007, because such securities were reasonably expected to be
realized in cash or sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the business, however we have classified these securities as non-current investments in our consolidated financial
statements as of March 31, 2008 due to uncertainties of the timing of liquidation.

If
the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to successfully close future auctions, their credit ratings deteriorate and we determine that an
"other-than-temporary" decline in fair market value has occurred, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments. We believe we will be
able to liquidate our investment without significant loss, and we currently believe these securities are not significantly impaired, primarily due to the government guarantee of a substantial portion
of the underlying loans, however, it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes (up to 39 years) to realize our investments' par value. Based on our other available cash and
expected operating cash flows and financing, we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan or to consummate the
proposed post-closing self tender offer described in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Additionally, we have received indications
from certain lenders that we may borrow against the par value of the securities at competitive rates.

Item 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On February 8, 2008, the Wayne County Employees' Retirement System filed a lawsuit challenging the transactions contemplated by the business combination
agreement, dated as of December 1, 2007, among us, a wholly owned subsidiary of ours established in connection with the proposed transaction, Vivendi, S.A., Vivendi Games, Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Vivendi, S.A., and VGAC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vivendi, S.A., and the sole stockholder of Vivendi Games, Inc. The suit is a putative class action
filed against the parties to that business combination agreement as well as certain members of our Board of Directors. The plaintiff alleges, among other things, that our directors named therein
failed to fulfill their fiduciary duties with regard to the transactions by "surrendering" the negotiating process to "conflicted management," that those breaches were aided and abetted by
Vivendi, S.A., and those of its subsidiaries named in the complaint, and that a preliminary proxy


statement
contains certain statements that the plaintiff alleges are false and misleading. The plaintiff seeks an order from the court that, among other things, certifies the case as a class action,
enjoins the transaction, requires the defendants to disclose all material information, declares that the transaction is in breach of the directors' fiduciary duties and therefore unlawful and
unenforceable, awards the plaintiff and the putative class damages for all profits and special benefits obtained by the defendant in connection with the transaction and tender offer, and awards the
plaintiff its cost and expense, including attorney's fees.

In
a ruling on March 12, 2008, the court initially declined to schedule a preliminary injunction hearing or allow broad discovery, pending the Company's filing of a revised
preliminary proxy statement in connection with the proposed transactions. The court did order the parties to initiate discovery of core documents, and the Company made an initial production of
documents. On March 7, 2008, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, the grounds for which were detailed in a brief filed on April 30, 2008. On April 30, 2008, the
Company also filed a motion to stay discovery in the case pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss. Separately, on March 6, 2008, Vivendi, S.A., and those of its subsidiaries named in
the complaint filed a motion to dismiss the sole claim alleged against them.

On
May 8, 2008, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint that, among other things, added allegations relating to a revised preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company on
April 30, 2008. That same date, the plaintiff also renewed its motion for expedited proceedings. On May 13, 2008, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On May 14,
2008, Vivendi and its subsidiaries named in the amended complaint also moved to dismiss. On May 22, 2008, the court scheduled a combined hearing for June 30, 2008 on the plaintiff's
motion for a preliminary injunction and the defendants' motions to dismiss, but withheld a ruling on the plaintiff's motion for expedited discovery, pending further briefing. On May 28, 2008,
the court ordered that expedited discovery proceed as to certain claims and that final briefing on the motions to be heard on June 30, 2008 be filed with the court on June 27, 2008.

In
July 2006, individuals and/or entities claiming to be our stockholders filed derivative lawsuits, purportedly on our behalf, against certain current and former members of our Board of
Directors as well as several of our current and former officers. Three derivative actions have been filed in Los Angeles Superior Court: Vazquez v. Kotick, et al ., L.A.S.C. Case No. BC355327
(filed July 12, 2006); Greuer v. Kotick, et al. L.A.S.C. Case No. SC090343 (filed July 12, 2006); and Amalgamated Bank v. Baker, et al., L.A.S.C. Case No. BC356454 (filed
August 3, 2006). These actions have been consolidated by the court under the caption In re Activision Shareholder Derivative Litigation, L.A.S.C. Master File No. SC090343 (West, J.).
Four derivative actions have been filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California: Pfeiffer v. Kotick, et al., C.D. Cal. Case No. CV06-4771 MRP
(JTLx) (filed July 31, 2006), Hamian v. Kotick, et al., C.D. Cal. Case No. CV06-5375 MRP (JLTx) (filed August 25, 2006) Abdelnur vs. Kotick et al., C.D. Cal. Case
No. CV07-3575 AHM (PJWx) (filed June 1, 2007), and Scarborough v. Kotick et al., C.D. Cal. Case No. CV07-4602 SVW (PLAx) (filed July 18, 2007).
These actions have also been consolidated, under the caption In re Activision, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation, C.D. Cal. Case No. CV06-4771 MRP (JTLx) (Pfaelzer, J.).
The consolidated complaints allege, among other things, purported improprieties in our issuance of stock options. Plaintiffs seek various relief on our behalf, including damages, restitution of
benefits obtained from the alleged misconduct, equitable relief, including an accounting and rescission of option contracts; and various corporate governance reforms. We expect that defense expenses
associated with the matters will be covered by our directors and officers insurance, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable policies.

On
or about December 4, 2007, we, the plaintiffs, and certain of our current and former officers and directors notified the court in the federal action that we had reached
agreement in principle to settle the shareholder derivative litigation pending against such current and former directors and officers of ours. On January 17, 2008, the parties amended that
agreement to, among other things,


include
the plaintiffs in the state court action as parties thereto. The nonbinding agreement in principle was subject, among other things, to the negotiation of a binding definitive settlement
agreement addressing all settlement terms, as well as to further approval by the parties and the court.

Effective
as of May 8, 2008, the parties signed a Stipulation of Settlement with respect to these matters. In entering into the Stipulation of Settlement, neither we nor any of
the settling parties has admitted to
any liability or wrongdoing. Under the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement, which is subject to court approval, we will adopt, implement and/or maintain certain corporate governance and internal
control measures, relating principally to the following: board composition, structure and practices, director independence standards, stock ownership and compensation, and education; shareholder
proposal evaluation process; nomination procedures for shareholder-nominated directors; shareholder meeting procedures; executive compensation policies and procedures; insider trading controls; and
stock option granting procedures. We have agreed to keep these measures in place for a period of three years, subject to certain exceptions. The Stipulation of Settlement also addresses matters
relating to the agreements by certain of our current and former directors and officers to reimburse the Company in connection with the receipt of options that required measurement date corrections. In
the case of options already exercised, the agreements allowed reimbursement to be made either by cancellation of vested but unexercised options with a value equivalent to the additional exercise price
or by payment of additional exercise price. In the case of options not yet exercised, the exercise price to be paid upon future exercise of those options is increased. In the aggregate, settling
defendants have elected to cancel options to acquire approximately 800,000 shares of our common stock and have agreed to increases in the exercise prices of approximately 16.1 million options.
In addition, the Stipulation of Settlement provides for us to pay $10,000,000 to plaintiffs' attorneys for their fees and expenses, subject to court approval of such fees and expenses and subject to
our reservation of all rights against our D&O insurance carriers, reinsurers and co-insurers. The Stipulation of Settlement provides that plaintiffs' attorneys will also be entitled to 15%
(up to $750,000) of any payment made by our insurance carriers to us in connection with the settlement. We have not reached agreements with our insurers related to the settlement. The stipulation also
provides for the forgiveness of approximately $2.3 million in legal fees previously billed to us by former outside corporate counsel.

The
Stipulation of Settlement was filed in federal court on May 12, 2008 and was preliminarily approved by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California by order
dated May 13, 2008 and entered on May 14, 2008. The settlement is subject to final court approval after notice and a hearing at which shareholders will have the opportunity to object,
which is currently scheduled to be held on July 21, 2008. The court will then decide whether to approve the settlement as fair, adequate and in the best interest of our stockholders. While we
believe that the settlement meets these criteria, there can be no guarantee that the settlement will receive the required court approval. If final approval is granted, all claims against all
defendants in the litigation will be dismissed with prejudice, and all claims that were or could have been brought by any derivative plaintiff, and all claims that arise from or relate to the matters
or occurrences that were or could have been alleged in the federal and state derivative actions, will be fully, finally and forever released. The individual settling defendants make no admission of
wrongdoing under the Stipulation of Settlement, and they have denied (and continue to deny) all charges of wrongdoing and liability and each and all of the claims and contentions alleged in the
derivative actions.

On
July 24, 2006, we received a letter of informal inquiry from the SEC requesting certain documents and information relating to our historical stock option grant practices.
Thereafter, in early June 2007, the SEC issued a formal order of non-public investigation, pursuant to which it subpoenaed documents from us related to the investigation, and testimony and documents
from certain current and former directors, officers and employees of ours. The Company has made an offer of settlement to the Staff of the SEC, which the SEC Staff has indicated it is prepared to
recommend to the SEC. The tentative settlement of the SEC's investigation, which would allege violations of various provisions of the Federal securities laws, is subject to agreement on the specific
language of the settlement


documents,
and then to review and approval by the SEC. There can be no assurance that a final settlement will be approved. In connection with the proposed settlement, the Company would not be required
to pay a monetary penalty. Under the proposed settlement, the Company would settle this matter without admitting or denying the SEC's findings.

In
addition, we are party to other routine claims and suits brought by us and against us in the ordinary course of business, including disputes arising over the ownership of intellectual
property rights, contractual claims, employment laws, regulations and relationships, and collection matters. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such
routine claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Cash Dividends

We paid no cash dividends in our fiscal years 2008 or 2007 nor do we anticipate paying any cash dividends at any time in the foreseeable future. We expect that
earnings will be retained for the continued growth and development of the business. Future dividends, if any, will depend upon our
earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.


Stock Splits

In April 2003, the Board of Directors approved a three-for-two split of our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 50% stock
dividend. The split was paid on June 6, 2003 to shareholders of record as of May 16, 2003. In February 2004, the Board of Directors approved a second
three-for-two split of our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend. The split was paid on March 15, 2004 to shareholders of record as of
February 23, 2004. In February 2005, the Board of Directors approved a four-for-three split of our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a


/


% stock dividend. The split was paid on March 22, 2005 to shareholders of record as of March 7, 2005. In September 2005, the Board of Directors approved a
four-for-three split of our outstanding common shares effected in the form of a 33


/


% stock dividend. The split was paid October 24, 2005 to shareholders
of record as of October 10, 2005. The par value of our common stock was maintained at the pre-split amount of $.000001. All share and per share data have been restated as if the
stock splits had occurred as of the earliest period presented.

On
March 7, 2005, in connection with our March 22, 2005 stock split, all shares of common stock held as treasury stock were formally cancelled and restored to the status of
authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

Buyback Program

During fiscal 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a buyback program under which we can repurchase up to $350.0 million of our common stock. Under the
program, shares may be purchased as determined by management, from time to time and within certain guidelines, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including privately
negotiated structured stock repurchase transactions and through transactions in the options markets. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at
any time or from time to time without prior notice.

Under
the buyback program, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, 2007, 2006 or 2005. We repurchased approximately
3.4 million shares of our common stock for $12.4 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. In addition, approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock were
acquired in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 as a result of the settlement of $10.0 million of structured stock repurchase transactions entered into in fiscal 2003. As of
March 31, 2008, we had no outstanding structured stock repurchase transactions. Structured stock repurchase transactions are settled in cash or stock based on the market price of our common
stock on the date of the settlement. Upon settlement, we either have our capital investment returned with a premium or receive shares of our common stock, depending, respectively, on whether the
market price of our common stock is above or below a pre-determined price agreed in connection with each such transaction.

Shareholders' Rights Plan

On April 18, 2000, our Board of Directors approved a shareholders rights plan (the "Rights Plan.") Under the Rights Plan, each common shareholder at the
close of business on April 19, 2000 received a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held. Each right represents the right to purchase one six-hundredths
(


/


) of a share, as adjusted on account of stock dividends made since the plan's adoption, of our Series A Junior Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $6.67, as adjusted on
account of stock dividends made since the plan's adoption. Initially, the rights are represented by our common stock certificates and are neither exercisable nor traded separately from our common
stock. The rights will only become exercisable if a person or group acquires 15% or more of the common stock of Activision, or announces or commences a tender or exchange offer which would result in
the bidder's beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock.


In
the event that any person or group acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, each holder of a right (other than such person or members of such group) will thereafter have
the right to receive upon exercise of such right, in lieu of shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock, the number of shares of common stock of Activision having a value equal to two times the
then current exercise price of the right. If we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person has acquired 15% or more of our common stock, each holder of a right
will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such right a number of the acquiring company's common shares having a market value equal to two times the then current exercise price of the
right. For persons who, as of the close of business on April 18, 2000, beneficially own 15% or more of the common stock of Activision, the Rights Plan "grandfathers" their current level of
ownership, so long as they do not purchase additional shares in excess of certain limitations.

We
may redeem the rights for $0.01 per right at any time until the first public announcement of the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 15% of our common stock. At any time after a
person has
acquired 15% or more (but before any person has acquired more than 50%) of our common stock, we may exchange all or part of the rights for shares of common stock at an exchange ratio of one share of
common stock per right. The rights expire on April 18, 2010.

We
amended the Rights Plan concurrent with the execution of the business combination agreement with Vivendi (see Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
in Item 8) to provide that (a) the Rights Plan will not be triggered by the business combination agreement or the transaction and (b) the Rights Plan will terminate upon the
completion of the transaction and all rights existing under the Rights Plan will be extinguished.

Item 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Our Business

We are a leading international publisher of interactive entertainment software products. We have built a company with a diverse portfolio of products that spans a
wide range of categories and target markets and that are used on a variety of game hardware platforms and operating systems. We have created, licensed, and acquired a group of highly recognizable
franchises, which we market to a variety of consumer demographics. Our fiscal 2008 product portfolio includes titles such as

Guitar Hero III: Legends of
Rock

,

Guitar Hero II

for the Microsoft Xbox360

, Guitar Hero: Rocks the
80s

for the PS2,

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Spider-Man 3 The Game ("Spider-Man 3"), Shrek the Third,
TRANSFORMERS: The Game, Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, Tony Hawk's Proving Ground, Bee Movie Game,

and

Spider-Man: Friend or
Foe.

Our
products cover diverse game categories including action/adventure, action sports, racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person action,
music-based gaming, and strategy. Our target customer base ranges from casual players to game enthusiasts, children to adults, and mass-market consumers to "value" buyers. We
currently offer our products primarily in versions that operate on the Sony PlayStation 2 ("PS2"), the Sony PlayStation 3 ("PS3"), the Nintendo Wii ("Wii"), and the Microsoft Xbox360
("Xbox360") console systems, the Nintendo Dual Screen ("NDS"), and the Sony PlayStation Portable ("PSP") hand-held devices, and the personal computer ("PC"). The installed base for the
previous generation of hardware platforms (e.g., the
PS2) is significant and the fiscal 2006 release of the Xbox360 and the fiscal 2007 releases of the PS3 and the Wii have further expanded the software market. To take advantage of the growth of the
PS3, the Xbox360, and the Wii ("the next-generation platforms"), during fiscal 2008, we increased our presence on the next-generation platforms through the increased number of
new released titles on the next-generation platforms. For example, the number of new released titles for the Wii tripled from 5 releases during fiscal 2007 to 15 releases,
and we successfully released several major titles for the PS3, the Xbox360 and/or the Wii—

Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock

,

Call of Duty 4: Modern
Warfare

,

Spider-Man 3

,

Shrek
the Third

,

TRANSFORMERS: The Game

, and

Tony Hawk's Proving Ground

. Some of these
titles are also available on the PS2. Our plan is to continue to build a significant presence on the PS3, the Wii, and the Xbox360 ("the next-generation platforms") by continuing to expand
the number of titles released on the next-generation and hand-held platforms while continuing to market to the PS2 platform as long as economically attractive given its
large installed base.

Our
publishing business involves the development, marketing, and sale of products directly, by license, or through our affiliate label program with certain third-party
publishers. In North America, we primarily sell our products on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game specialty stores. We
conduct our international publishing activities through offices in the United Kingdom ("UK"), Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Australia, Canada, South Korea, and Japan.
Our products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements, and through our wholly owned
European distribution subsidiaries. Our distribution business consists of operations located in the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany that provide logistical and sales services to
third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Our
profitability is directly affected by the mix of revenues from our publishing and distribution businesses. Operating margins realized from our publishing business are typically
substantially higher than margins realized from our distribution business. Operating margins in our publishing business are affected by our ability to release highly successful or "hit" titles. Though
many of these titles have substantial production or acquisition costs and marketing budgets, once a title recoups these costs,


incremental
net revenues directly and positively impact our operating margin. Operating margins in our distribution business are affected by the mix of hardware and software sales, with software
typically producing higher margins than hardware.

Our Focus

With respect to future game development, we will continue to focus on our "big propositions" products that are backed by strong franchises and high quality
development, for which we will provide significant marketing support.

We
have focused on establishing and maintaining relationships with talented and experienced software development and publishing teams. In June 2006, we acquired RedOctane, Inc.
("RedOctane"), the publisher of the popular Guitar Hero franchise. The Guitar Hero franchise has set an industry record, surpassing $1 billion in North America retail sales in 26 months,
according to The NPD Group, which is a provider of consumer and retail market research information for a wide range of industries.

Guitar Hero III: Legends of
Rock

was the number one best-selling game in dollars in the U.S. and Europe for fiscal 2008, according to The NPD Group, Charttrack and Gfk. We plan on continuing
to build on this franchise by investing in the future development of Guitar Hero titles across a variety of platforms. We have also been successful in the first person action categories through the
Call of Duty original franchise, which we plan on continuing as a successful long-term franchise. Call of Duty has achieved over $1 billion life-to-date net
revenues in fiscal 2008.

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare

ended the fiscal year as the number two best-selling game worldwide in dollars,
according to The NPD Group, Charttrack and Gfk. In September 2007, we acquired U.K.-based video game developer Bizarre Creations Limited ("Bizarre Creations"), a leader in the racing category. With
more than 10 years of experience in the racing genre, Bizarre Creations developed the innovative multi-million unit selling franchise, Project Gotham Racing for Microsoft, a
critically-acclaimed series for the Xbox and Xbox360. Bizarre Creations and its games have won numerous industry awards including: Best Racing Game for

Project Gotham Racing

from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA); the Industry Grand Prix Award from Develop; MCV's UK Development Team 2006 award; Best Racing/Driving Game from
IGN; Game of the Year from OXM and Gamespy for

Project Gotham Racing 3

; and IGN's Best Xbox Live Arcade ("XBLA") Game for

Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved

.
Bizarre Creations will play a role in our growth strategy as we develop new intellectual property for the racing segment,
expand our development capability and capacity for other genres and utilize Bizarre Creations' proprietary development technology. We also have development agreements with other top-level,
third-party developers such as id Software, Inc., Splash Damage, Ltd., and Next Level Games.

Our
fiscal 2008 releases include well-established franchises, which are backed by high-profile intellectual property and/or highly anticipated motion picture
releases. For example, we have a long-term relationship with Marvel Entertainment, Inc. through an exclusive licensing agreement for the Spider-Man and X-Men
franchises through 2017. This agreement grants us the exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and publish video games based on Marvel's comic book franchises: Spider-Man and
X-Men. In addition, we have an agreement with Spider-Man Merchandising, LP which grants us exclusive, worldwide rights to publish video games based on subsequent
Spider-Man feature films through 2017. Through March 31, 2008, games based on the Spider-Man and X-Men franchises have generated approximately
$1.1 billion in net revenues worldwide. Under this agreement, in the first quarter fiscal 2007 we released the video game,

X-Men: The Official
Game

coinciding with the theatrical release of

X-Men: The Last Stand

. In the third quarter fiscal 2007, we released

Marvel: Ultimate
Alliance

across multiple platforms and

Spider-Man: Battle for New York

on
the NDS and the GBA. In the first quarter fiscal 2008, we released

Spider-Man 3

based on Columbia Pictures/Marvel
Entertainment, Inc.'s feature film "Spider-Man 3," which was released in May 2007. We also released

Spider-Man: Friend or
Foe

in the third quarter fiscal 2008.


We
also have an exclusive licensing agreement with professional skateboarder Tony Hawk. The agreement grants us exclusive rights to develop and publish video games through 2015 using
Tony Hawk's name and likeness. Through March 31, 2008, we have released nine titles in the Tony Hawk franchise with cumulative net revenues of $1.3 billion, including the fiscal 2008
third quarter release,

Tony Hawk's Proving Ground,

which was released on the PS3, the PS2, the Wii, the Xbox360 and the NDS.

We
will also continue to evaluate and exploit emerging franchises that we believe have potential to become successful game franchises. For example, we have multi-year,
multi-property, agreements with DreamWorks Animation LLC that grant us the exclusive rights to publish video games based on DreamWorks Animation SKG's theatrical releases, including "Shark
Tale," which was released in the second quarter fiscal 2005, "Madagascar," which was released in the first quarter fiscal 2006, "Over the Hedge," which was released in the first quarter fiscal 2007,
"Shrek the Third," which was released in the first quarter fiscal 2008, "Bee Movie," which was released in the third quarter fiscal 2008, and all of their respective sequels. In addition, our
multi-year agreements with DreamWorks Animation LLC also grant us the exclusive video game rights to three upcoming DreamWorks Animation feature films, including "Kung Fu Panda,"
"Monsters vs Aliens" and "How to Train Your Dragon." We plan to release

Kung Fu Panda

,

Monsters vs
Aliens

, and

Madagascar 2

during fiscal 2009.

Additionally,
we have a strategic alliance with Harrah's Entertainment, Inc. that grants us the exclusive, worldwide interactive rights to develop and publish "World Series of
Poker" video games based on the popular World Series of Poker Tournament. In the second quarter fiscal 2006, we released our first title under this alliance,

World Series of
Poker,

which became the number one poker title of calendar year 2005. Further building on this franchise, in the second quarter fiscal 2007, we released our second title under
this alliance,

World Series of Poker: Tournament of Champions

. Additionally, we released our third title under this alliance,

World Series of Poker: Battle for the
Bracelet

in the second quarter fiscal 2008.

We
also continue to build on our portfolio of licensed intellectual property. In February 2006, we signed an agreement with Hasbro Properties Group granting us the exclusive global
rights (excluding Japan) to develop console, hand-held, and PC games based on Hasbro's "Transformers" franchise. We released our first "Transformers" game,

TRANSFORMERS: The Game

, in late June 2007
concurrently with the early July 2007 movie release of the live action "Transformers" film from DreamWorks
Pictures and Paramount Pictures. In April 2006, we signed an agreement with MGM Interactive and EON Productions Ltd. granting us the exclusive rights to develop and publish video games based on
the James Bond license through 2014. We plan to release our first James Bond title,

Quantum of Solace

, during fiscal 2009.

In
April 2006, we signed a multi-year agreement with Mattel, Inc. which grants us the exclusive, worldwide distribution rights for the catalog of video games based on
Mattel, Inc.'s Barbie franchise on all platforms. Through the third quarter fiscal 2007, we distributed six Barbie titles:

Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses, The
Barbie Diaries: High School Mystery, Barbie Fashion Show, Barbie Horse Adventures: Mystery Ride, Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus,

and

Barbie as the
Princess and the Pauper.

Based on the success of this distribution, we signed multi-year license
agreements with Mattel, Inc. in January 2007 which grant us the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and publish new video games based on Mattel Inc.'s

Barbie

and

Hot
Wheels

franchises on all platforms. In the second quarter fiscal 2008, we released

Hot Wheels: Beat That!

. In September 2006, we entered into a distribution agreement with MTV Networks Kids and Family Group's Nickelodeon, a division of
Viacom Inc., to be the exclusive distributor of three new Nick Jr. PC CD-ROM titles, published by Nickelodeon and based on the top preschool series on commercial television,

Dora The Explorer, The Backyardigans,

and

Go, Diego, Go!


We
are utilizing these developer relationships, new intellectual property acquisitions, new original intellectual property creations, and our existing library of intellectual property to
further focus our game development on product lines that will deliver significant, lasting, and recurring revenues and operating profits.

Business Combination

On December 2, 2007, we and Vivendi S.A. ("Vivendi") announced an agreement to combine Vivendi Games, Inc. ("Vivendi Games,") Vivendi's
interactive entertainment business which includes Blizzard Entertainment, Inc., the creator of

World of Warcraft

, a massively multi-player online
role-playing game ("MMORPG") franchise, with us. If the transaction closes, we will be renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc. ("Activision Blizzard") and we expect to continue to operate
as a public company traded on NASDAQ under the ticker ATVI.

All
information included in this report reflects only Activision's results, and does not reflect any impact of the proposed combination. The forward-looking comments in this Management's
Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are prepared on an Activision standalone basis, without considering any potential impacts of the proposed business
combination with Vivendi Games.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial results. The impact and any associated risks
related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our
reported and expected financial results. For a
detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our
customers, and once any performance obligations have been completed. Certain products are sold to customers with a street date (the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these
products we recognize revenue on the later of the street date or the sale date. Revenue from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection. With
respect to license agreements that provide customers the right to make multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenue is recognized upon delivery of a master copy. Per copy royalties on
sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned.

Some
of our software products provide limited online features at no additional cost to the consumer. Generally, we consider such features to be incidental to the overall product offering
and an inconsequential deliverable. Accordingly, we do not defer any revenue related to products containing these limited online features. In instances where online features or additional
functionality is considered a substantive deliverable in addition to the software product, we take this into account when applying our revenue recognition policy. This evaluation is performed for each
software product when it is released. We determined that one of our software titles,

Enemy Territory: Quake Wars

(which is primarily an online
multiplayer PC game), contains online functionality that constitutes a more-than-inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product, principally because of
its importance to game play. As such, our performance obligations for this title extend beyond the sale of the game, which is unique compared to other previously released titles. Vendor-specific
objective


evidence
of fair value ("VSOE") does not exist for the online functionality, as we do not separately charge for this component of the title. As a result, we are recognizing all of the revenue from the
sale of this title ratably over an estimated service period, which is currently estimated to be six months beginning the month after shipment. In addition, we are deferring the costs of sales for this
title. Cost of sales includes: manufacturing costs, software royalties and amortization, and intellectual property licenses. Overall, online play functionality is still an emerging area for us.

We
continue to monitor the development of online functionality (together with online transactions, such as electronics downloads of titles or product add-ons) and its
significance to our products. Based on our current assessment of obligations with respect to the online functionality for certain of our fiscal 2009 titles on certain platforms, we expect that certain
fiscal 2009 titles will contain online functionality that constitutes a more-than-inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product, and that our
performance obligations for these fiscal 2009 titles will extend beyond the sale of the game. VSOE of fair value does not exist for these online features, as we do not plan to separately charge for
this component of these fiscal 2009 titles. As a result, we expect to recognize all of the revenue from the sale of these fiscal 2009 titles ratably over an estimated service
period, which is currently estimated to be six months beginning the month after shipment. In addition, we expect to defer the costs of sales of these fiscal 2009 titles. We anticipate that, in fiscal
2009, we will likely defer approximately $350.0 million in net revenues and $150.0 million in costs of sales from the sale of these fiscal 2009 titles into fiscal 2010. Since most of
these fiscal 2009 titles are planned to release in the third quarter fiscal 2009, we expect that a majority of revenues and costs of sales for these products will be deferred in the third quarter
fiscal 2009, and recognized later in the calendar year 2009. However, the actual amount of revenues and costs of sales deferred will vary significantly depending upon the timing of the release of
these fiscal 2009 titles and the sales volume of such products.

With
respect to online transactions, such as electronic downloads of titles or product add-ons, revenue is recognized when the fee is paid by the online customer to purchase
online content and we are notified by the online retailer that the product has been downloaded. In addition, in order to recognize revenue for both product sales and licensing transactions, persuasive
evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection of the related receivable must be probable.

Sales
incentives or other consideration given by us to our customers is accounted for in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF")
Issue 01-9,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's Products

). In
accordance with EITF Issue 01-9, sales incentives and other consideration that are considered adjustments of the selling price of our products, such as rebates and product placement
fees, are reflected as reductions of revenue. Sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received, such as the appearance of our products in a
customer's national circular advertisement, are reflected as sales and marketing expenses.

Allowances for Returns, Price Protection, Doubtful Accounts, and Inventory Obsolescence.

We closely monitor and analyze the
historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other publishers and the anticipated timing of other releases in order to assess future demands of current and
upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent reorders are evaluated to ensure that quantities are sufficient to meet the demands from the retail markets but at the same
time, are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel. We benchmark our units to be shipped to our customers using historical and industry data.

We
may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the circumstances when we elect to
decrease the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and applicable, allows customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and/or
future invoices. The conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or price protection are,


among
other things, compliance with applicable payment terms and consistent delivery to us of inventory and sell-through reports. We may also consider other factors, including the
facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market factors. Management must make estimates of potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product
revenue. We estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for current period product revenue utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and
acceptance of our products by the end consumer. The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for a particular title: historical performance of titles in
similar genres, historical performance of the hardware platform, historical performance of the franchise, console hardware life cycle, our sales force and retail customer feedback, industry pricing,
weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory, absolute quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory, our warehouse on-hand inventory levels, the title's recent
sell-through history (if available), marketing trade programs, and competing titles. The relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other items, genre,
platform, seasonality, and sales strategy. Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any
accounting period. Based upon historical experience we believe our estimates are reasonable. However, actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a
number of reasons including, among others, a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor, or technological obsolescence due to
the emergence of new hardware platforms. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if factors or market conditions change or if management makes different
judgments or utilizes different estimates in determining the allowances for returns and price protection. For example, a 1% change in our March 31, 2008 allowance for returns and price
protection would impact net revenues by $1.3 million.

Similarly,
management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze the age of current outstanding
account balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes in our customers' payment terms and their economic condition, as well
as whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance. Any significant changes in any of these criteria would affect management's estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts.

We
value inventory at the lower of cost or market. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and in the retail channel and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory
based on the future expected demand for our products. Significant changes in demand for our products would impact management's estimates in establishing our inventory provision.

Software Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses.

Software development costs include payments made to
independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for internally developed products.

We
account for software development costs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed

. Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are
determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product encompasses both technical design documentation and game design documentation. Significant management judgments and estimates are
utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Technological feasibility is
evaluated on a product-by-product basis. Prior to a product's release, we expense, as part of "cost of sales—software royalties and amortization," capitalized costs
when we believe such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation. Amounts
related


to
software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to product development expense.

Commencing
upon product release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "cost of sales—software royalties and amortization" based on the ratio of current
revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months or less.

Intellectual
property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks, copyrights, software, technology, music or other
intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our products. Depending upon the agreement with the rights holder, we may obtain the rights to use acquired intellectual property in
multiple products over multiple years, or alternatively, for a single product. Prior to the related product's release, we expense, as part of "cost of sales—intellectual property
licenses," capitalized intellectual property costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized intellectual property costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned are
charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation.

Commencing
upon the related product's release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to "cost of sales—intellectual property licenses" based on the
ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed property will be utilized. As intellectual property license contracts may extend
for multiple years, the amortization of capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year.

We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior
periods, the primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, the recoverability of capitalized software development costs is
evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed trademark or copyright is to be used. Criteria used to evaluate expected product
performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and for any sequel product, estimated performance
based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based. As many of our intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability
of capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors, such as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property,
whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property, and the rights holder's continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual
property.

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the
assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than, and/or
revised forecasted or actual costs are greater than, the original forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in
any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Additionally, as noted above, as many of our intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple years, we also
assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors such as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the
intellectual property, whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property and the rights holder's continued promotion and exploitation of
the intellectual property. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of charges for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in evaluating
these qualitative factors.

Stock-based Compensation Expense.

On April 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

, ("SFAS No. 123R") which requires


the
measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors, including employee stock options and employee stock purchases made
pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on estimated fair values. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS No. 123R for the years ended March 31, 2008, and 2007
was $53.6 million, and $25.5 million, respectively. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

We
estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial-lattice model. The fair value of a share-based payment as of the grant date estimated in accordance
with this option pricing model depends upon our future stock price as well as assumptions concerning expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and risk-adjusted stock
return, and
measures of employees' forfeiture, exercise, and post-vesting termination behavior. Statistical methods were used to estimate employee rank specific termination rates. These termination
rates, in turn, were used to model the number of options that are expected to vest and employees' post-vesting termination behavior. Employee rank specific estimates of expected
time-to-exercise ("ETTE") were used to reflect employee exercise behavior. ETTE was estimated by using statistical procedures to first estimate the conditional probability of
exercise occurring during each time period, conditional on the option surviving to that time period and then using those probabilities to estimate ETTE. The model was calibrated by adjusting
parameters controlling exercise and post-vesting termination behavior so that the measures output by the model matched values of these measures that were estimated from historical data.
The weighted-average estimated value of employee stock options granted during the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 was $9.21 and $5.86, respectively, per share using the binomial-lattice
model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

To
estimate volatility for the binomial-lattice model, we use methods or capabilities that are discussed in SFAS No. 123R and SAB No. 107. These methods included the
implied volatility method, which is based upon the volatilities for exchange-traded options with respect to our stock, to estimate short-term volatility, the historical method which is
based upon the annualized standard deviation of the instantaneous returns on Activision's stock during the option's contractual term, to estimate long-term volatility and a statistical
model to estimate the transition or "mean reversion" from short-term volatility to long-term volatility. Based on these methods, for options granted during the year ended
March 31, 2008, the expected stock price volatility ranged from 34% to 53%, with a weighted-average volatility of 51%. For options granted
during the year ended March 31, 2007, the expected stock price volatility ranged from 38% to 56%, with a weighted average volatility of 54%.

As
was the case for volatility, the risk-free rate is assumed to change during the option's contractual period. As required by a binomial-lattice model, the
risk-free rate reflects the interest from one time period to the next (the "forward rate") as opposed to the interest rate from the grant date to the given time period (the "spot rate.")
Since we do not currently pay dividends and do not currently expect to pay them in the future, we have assumed that the dividend yield is zero.

The
expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is, as required by SFAS No. 123R,
output by the binomial-lattice model. The expected life of employee stock options depends on all of the underlying


assumptions
and calibration of our model. The binomial-lattice model assumes that employees will exercise options when the stock price equals or exceeds an exercise boundary. The exercise boundary is
not constant but continually declines as one approaches the option's expiration date. The exact placement of the exercise boundary depends on all of the model inputs as well as the measures that were
used to calibrate the model to estimated measures of employees' exercise and termination behavior.

Stock-based
compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
SFAS No. 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

If
factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of SFAS No. 123R in future periods, the compensation expense that we record under SFAS No. 123R may
differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.

Income Taxes.

We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, the provision for income taxes is computed
using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. Effective at the beginning of fiscal 2008, we adopted Financial Interpretation No. ("FIN") 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an
interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109

. Further information may be found in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

Management
believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax
effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be
realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves
significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of FIN 48 and other complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with
management's expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.

Results of Operations—Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2008 and 2007

Net Revenues

We primarily derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles (such as the PS2, PS3, Xbox360, and Wii),
PCs, and hand-held game devices (such as the NDS, and PSP). We also derive revenue from our distribution business in Europe that provides logistical and sales services to third-party
publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations and third-party manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Consolidated
net revenues increased 92% from $1,513.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 to $2,898.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2008.

In
the second quarter fiscal 2008, we determined to recognize all of the net revenues from the sale of one of our titles,

Enemy Territory: Quake
Wars

(which is primarily an online multiplayer PC game), on a deferred basis—straight-line over an estimated service period, which we estimate to be six
months beginning the month after shipment. There is no impact to consolidated net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2008.

Overall,
the increase in consolidated net revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, was driven by the following:

•

Our
total publishing net revenues increased substantially by $1,386.1 million year over year. This is due to the strong performance of titles released during fiscal
2008 in each territory. During fiscal 2008, in the U.S., we grew our market share by 7.2 percent to a record 17.3 percent, were the number one console and handheld software publisher in
dollars, and had three top-10 best-selling titles overall in dollars, according to The NPD Group. In particular,

Guitar Hero III: Legends of
Rock

, was the number one best-selling game in the U.S. and Europe in dollars for fiscal 2008, according to The NPD Group, Charttrack, and Gfk.

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare

ended the fiscal year as the number two best-selling game worldwide in dollars, according to The NPD Group,
Charttrack and Gfk. We have expanded our presence on the next-generation platforms through the increased number of premium priced titles released on those platforms. This has further
increased our publishing net revenues as the installed base of the next-generation platforms continues to expand. Other major worldwide releases contributing to the results were

Spider-Man 3

,

Shrek the Third, Bee Movie Game

as well as our new licensed intellectual
property

TRANSFORMERS: The Game

.

Spider Man 3

and

TRANSFORMERS: The
Game

were the number one and number two best-selling movie based games in dollars worldwide for fiscal 2008, according to The NPD Group, Charttrack and Gfk. In
fiscal 2007, our


major
releases included

Call of Duty 3, Guitar Hero 2, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Tony Hawk's Project 8, Over the Hedge, X-Men: Official Game, Shrek Smash N' Crash,
Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam

,

World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions, Pimp My Ride

, and titles for our Cabela's History
Channel and Barbie franchises.

•

Changes
in foreign exchange rates from a year over year strengthening of the Great Britain Pound ("GBP"), Euro ("EUR") and Australian Dollar ("AUD") in relation to the
United States Dollar ("USD") increased reported net revenues by approximately $87.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Excluding the impact of changing foreign currency rates,
our consolidated net revenues increased 86% compared to prior year.

In
fiscal 2009, we plan to publish

Guitar Hero: On Tour

for the NDS;

Guitar Hero:
Aerosmith

,

Guitar Hero: Metallica

, and

Guitar Hero IV

across multiple platforms.
We plan to release

Call of Duty 5

, and continue to expand our licensed titles such as

Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar: Escape 2
Africa

,

Monsters vs. Aliens, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2,

our first James Bond title,

Quantum of
Solace

, and several other titles. We also expect to increase our titles across multiple platforms to take advantage of the expected growth of different hardware platforms in
fiscal 2009. As a result, we anticipate net revenues will increase in fiscal 2009 in comparison to the record net revenues achieved in fiscal 2008. However, such increases may be offset by the impact
of revenue deferral described below.

When
we plan our fiscal 2009 titles releases, we continue to monitor the development of online functionality (together with online transactions, such as electronics downloads of titles
or product add-ons) and its significance to our products. Based on our current assessment of obligations with respect to the online functionality for certain of our fiscal 2009 titles on
certain platforms, we expect that certain fiscal 2009 titles will contain online functionality that constitutes a
more-than-inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product, and that our performance obligations for these fiscal 2009 titles will extend beyond the sale
of the game. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for these online features, as we do not plan to separately charge for this component of these fiscal 2009 titles. As a
result, we expect to recognize all of the revenue from the sale of these fiscal 2009 titles ratably over an estimated service period, which is currently estimated to be six months beginning the month
after shipment. In addition, we expect to defer the costs of sales of these fiscal 2009 titles. We anticipate that, in fiscal 2009, we will likely defer approximately $350.0 million in net
revenues and $150.0 million in costs of sales from the sale of these fiscal 2009 titles into fiscal 2010. Since most of these fiscal 2009 titles are planned to release in the third quarter
fiscal 2009, we expect that a majority of revenues and costs of sales for these products will be deferred in the third quarter fiscal 2009, and recognized later in the calendar year 2009. However, the
actual amount of revenues and costs of sales deferred will vary significantly depending upon the timing of the release of these fiscal 2009 titles and the sales volume of such products.

America publishing net revenues increased 134% from $753.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to $1,761.8 million for the year ended March 31,
2008. The main revenue drivers for the year ended March 31, 2008 were

Guitar Hero III

Legends of
Rock

and

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare

.

Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock

, was
the number one best-selling game in dollars in the U.S. for fiscal 2008, according to The NPD Group.

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare

ended
the fiscal 2008 as the number three best-selling game in dollars in the U.S., according to The NPD Group. Other key revenue contributors during the year include

Guitar Hero II

for the Xbox360,

Spider-Man 3

,

Shrek the

.


North
America publishing net revenues increased as a percentage of consolidated net revenues from 50% for the year ended March 31, 2007 to 61% for the year ended March 31,
2008. The increases in the percentages of total consolidated net revenues were a result of the stronger growth in net revenues for the publishing segment than that of the distribution segment during
the year.

International
publishing net revenues increased by 103% from $365.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to $743.4 million for the year ended March 31,
2008. The increase in international publishing net revenues was primarily due to the increase in the number of titles released internationally in fiscal 2008, and the success of

Guitar Hero III

:

Legends of Rock

and

Call of Duty 4: Modern
Warfare

. We also grew our European market share from 4.8 percent to 7.4 percent during fiscal 2008, according to Charttrack and Gfk.

International
publishing net revenues were further increased by a year over year strengthening of the EUR, AUD, and GBP in relation to the USD of approximately $63.0 million for
the year ended March 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2007. Excluding the impact of changing foreign currency rates, our international publishing net revenues increased
86% year over year. As a percentage of consolidated net revenues, international publishing net revenues increased slightly from 24% for the year ended March 31, 2007 to 26% for the year ended
March 31, 2008. The slight increase in the percentage of total consolidated net revenues was a result of the stronger growth in net revenues for the publishing segment than that of the

Net
revenues from sales of titles for the PC increased 98% from $78.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to $156.1 million for the year ended March 31,
2008. The increases were primarily due to the strong performance of our fiscal 2008 PC release of

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare

. For fiscal 2008,

Call of Duty 4: Modern
Warfare

was the number one PC title in dollars worldwide, according to The NPD Group, Charttrack and Gfk. The increase also
resulted from an increased number of titles, both mainline titles and value titles, released on the PC. This compares to fiscal 2007 where net revenues
were primarily derived from catalog sales of

Call of Duty 2

,

Quake 4

and

The
Movies

, as well as revenues from our European affiliate title LucasArts'

Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy

.

We
plan to release several key titles on the PC in fiscal 2009, however, we anticipate net revenues from the PC to be partially offset by the impact of revenue deferral as previously
discussed.

The
PS3 was released in North America in November 2006 and in Europe in March 2007. With more than a full year for the installed base of the PS3 to expand, and our increased number of
titles available on the PS3, net revenues from sales of titles for the PS3 increased 482% from $53.8 million, or 5% of publishing net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2007 to
$313.1 million, or 13% of publishing net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to the success of

Call of Duty 4:
Modern Warfare

, which was the number one best-selling title in dollars on the PS3, according to The NPD Group. Further, the increased number of titles
available on the PS3 has increased our revenues from this platform. We released eight titles on the PS3 during fiscal 2008 as compared to three titles for fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008, we released

Guitar Hero III: Legends
of Rock

,

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare

,

Spider-Man 3

,

TRANSFORMERS: The Game

,

Tony Hawk's Proving
Ground

,

Soldier of Fortune: Payback

,

,
and our European affiliate title LucasArts'

on the PS3. This compares to the third quarter fiscal 2007 releases of

Call of Duty 3

,

Marvel

:

Ultimate Alliance

and

Tony Hawk's Project 8

.

Over
the last twelve months, Sony has cut prices and introduced lower priced models of the PS3 hardware. These price reductions have grown the installed base of the PS3, which combined
with our strong slate of titles led to a significant increase in net revenues on the PS3 platform. We expect net revenues from sales of titles for the PS3 to continue to increase as we plan to
increase our releases on the PS3 to take advantage of the expected growth of the hardware installed base, however, we anticipate such increase will be partially offset by the impact of revenue
deferral as previously discussed.

In
general, there was an overall decline in industry sales of titles for the PS2 as more consumers migrated to the next-generation platforms as compared to the prior year.
However, net revenues from sales of our titles for the PS2 increased 43% from $500.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to $716.9 million for the year ended
March 31, 2008. The key titles impacting the fiscal 2008 results were

Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock

,

Spider-Man: Friend or Foe

,

Bee Movie Game, Tony Hawk's Proving Ground

,

Guitar Hero: Rocks the 80s

,

Spider-Man 3

,

Shrek the
Third

, and

TRANSFORMERS: The Game

and the continued momentum for our fiscal 2007 third quarter titles. This compares to the
titles released in fiscal 2007 such as

Call of Duty 3

, the number three title overall in dollars for the third quarter fiscal 2007, according to The NPD
Group, and

Guitar Hero II

(game and accessories), the number one best-selling title in dollars on the PS2 platform for the third
quarter fiscal 2007 per The NPD Group. Also, in fiscal 2007, we released

Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Over the Hedge, Tony Hawk's Project 8, X-Men: The Official Game,
Shrek Smash N' Crash Racing

and our European affiliate title, LucasArts'

Star Wars Lego 2

. As a percentage of publishing net
revenues, net revenues from the PS2 decreased from 45% for the year ended March 31, 2007 to 29% for the year ended March 31, 2008. This was mainly attributable to the growth of net
revenues from the next-generation platforms at a faster pace than revenues from the PS2.

Although
we expect net revenues from sales of titles for the PS2 to decline over time as consumers transition to the next-generation platforms, we expect significant net
revenues for the PS2 for fiscal 2009 as we plan to develop and release many of our key titles on this platform.

Net
revenues from sales of titles for the Xbox360 increased 292% from $200.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 to $785.5 million for the year ended
March 31, 2008. As a percentage of publishing net revenues, net revenues from sales of titles for the Xbox360 increased from 18% for the year ended March 31, 2007 to 31% for the year
ended March 31, 2008. These increases are due to the growing installed base for the Xbox360, as well as an increase in the number of new titles we released. In fiscal 2008, we released
seventeen titles for this platform, and the key revenue drivers were

Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock

which was the number one best-selling
game in dollars in the U.S. and Europe, and

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare

which was the number two best-selling game in dollars worldwide,
according to The NPD Group, Charttrack, and Gfk. Other major titles released on the Xbox360 in fiscal 2008 such as

Tony Hawk's Proving Ground

,

Guitar Hero II, Spider-Man

, and

TRANSFORMERS: The Game

also contributed to the increase in
revenues. This compares to our fiscal 2007 releases of ten titles for this platform, three of which,

Call of Duty 3, Tony Hawk's Project 8

and

Marvel: Ultimate
Alliance

ranked among the top ten Xbox360 titles during the third quarter fiscal 2007, according to The NPD Group.

In
August 2007, Microsoft announced a reduction of the retail price of the Xbox360 by $50 in the U.S. market and by EUR 50 in European markets. These price reductions have grown the
installed base of the Xbox360, which combined with our strong slate of titles led to a significant increase in net revenues on the Xbox360 platform. We expect net revenues from sales of titles for the
Xbox360 to continue to increase as we plan several key releases on the Xbox360 to take advantage of the expected growth of the hardware installed base, however, we anticipate such increase will be
partially offset by the impact of revenue deferral as previously discussed.

The
Wii was released in November 2006 and quickly gained strong consumer acceptance due to its innovative controller and mass market appeal. With more than a full year of expanding the
installed base of the Wii and our increased number of new titles on the Wii, net revenues from the sales of titles for the Wii increased to $309.9 million for the year ended March 31,
2008 from $54.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2007. As a percentage of publishing net revenues, net revenues from the sales of titles for the Wii increased from 5% to 12% year
over year. We released the first version of Guitar Hero for the Wii,

Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock

in the third quarter fiscal 2008 which was the
main contributor to our net revenues on the platform and the primary reason for the increase in net revenues from sales of Wii titles for the year ended March 31, 2008. Further, we have
released fourteen other Wii titles during fiscal 2008 as compared to five Wii titles released during fiscal 2007. Some of
the titles we released during fiscal 2008 were

Bee Movie Game

,

Spider-Man: Friend or Foe

,

Tony Hawk's Proving Ground

,

Dancing with Stars

,

Barbie Island
Princess

,

Cabela's: Big Game Hunter 2008

and, in Europe our affiliate LucasArt's titles,

Thrillville:
Off the Rails

, and

Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga

. This compares to the five titles concurrently released with the release of
the Wii in November 2006,

Call of Duty 3

,

Marvel: Ultimate Alliance

,

World
Series of Poker: Tournament of Champions

,

Rapala Tournament Fishing,

and

Tony Hawk's Downhill

We
expect net revenues from sales of titles for the Wii to continue to increase as we plan key releases on the Wii for the expected growth of the hardware installed base, however, we
anticipate such increase will be partially offset by the impact of revenue deferral as previously discussed.

During fiscal 2008, we have released more "big proposition" titles which contributed to the increase in net revenues. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to the releases of

Bee Movie Game

,

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare

,

Spider-Man: Friend
or Foe

,

Shrek: Ogres and Donkeys, TRANSFORMERS: The Game

on the PSP,

and our European affiliate title,

. As a percentage of publishing net revenues, net revenues from hand-held platforms
decreased from 13% for the year ended March 31, 2007 to 9% for the year ended March 31, 2008. This was mainly attributable to the growth of net revenues from the Guitar Hero titles on
the next-generation platforms and the Guitar Hero titles were not yet available on the hand-held platforms during fiscal 2008. Our first Guitar Hero title on the
hand-held platform will be released in fiscal 2009.

With
the installed base of the NDS and PSP continuing to increase and our increasing presence on hand-held platform, such as

Guitar Hero: On
Tour

, and several other titles, we expect fiscal 2009 hand-held net revenues to continue to increase year over year.


Overall

The platform mix of our future publishing net revenues will likely be impacted by a number of factors, including the ability of hardware manufacturers to continue
to increase their installed hardware base for the next-generation platforms, as well as the performance of key product releases from our product release schedule. According to The NPD
Group, we were the number one console and handheld software publisher in dollars for fiscal 2008. Additionally,

Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock

, was
the number one best-selling game in dollars in the U.S. and Europe for fiscal 2008, according to The NPD Group, Charttrack, and Gfk.

Call of Duty 4: Modern
Warfare

ended the fiscal year as the number two best-selling game worldwide in units, with sell-through of more than 9 million units to date,
according to The NPD Group, Charttrack and Gfk. In fiscal 2008, both the Guitar Hero and Call of Duty franchises surpassed a billion dollars in life to date net revenues.

A
significant portion of our revenues and profits are derived from a relatively small number of popular titles and franchises each year, so revenues and profits are significantly
affected by our ability to release highly successful "hit" titles. For example, for the year ended March 31, 2008, 65% of our consolidated net revenues and 75% of publishing net revenues were
derived from net revenues from three
franchises. This revenue concentration reflects an industry wide trend, with market share of the top 10 titles of calendar year 2007 doubling versus a year ago, according to The NPD Group. For fiscal
2008, we published three top-10 best-selling titles in dollars overall, according to The NPD Group. Though many of our titles have substantial production or acquisition costs
and marketing budgets, once a title recoups these costs, incremental net revenues directly and positively impact operating profits resulting in a disproportionate amount of operating income being
derived from these select titles. We expect that a limited number of titles and franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately large amount of our net revenues and profits.

Three
key factors that could affect future publishing and distribution net revenues performance are console hardware pricing, software pricing, and transitions in console platforms. As
console hardware moves through its life cycle, hardware manufacturers typically enact price reductions. Reductions in the price of console hardware typically result in an increase in the installed
base of hardware owned by consumers. Historically, we have also seen that lower console hardware prices put downward pressure on software pricing. However, we expect console software launch pricing
for the next-generation platforms to hold at current levels as a result of the strong consumer acceptance of these price points that has occurred since the launch of the
next-generation platforms and the greater product capability and entertainment value of next generation titles. We continue to expect software launch pricing on the PS2 to hold at $39.99
for top titles on this platform.

Distribution
net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2008 decreased slightly from $394.0 million to $393.0 million year over year. Foreign exchange rates increased
reported distribution net revenues by approximately $24.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Excluding the impact of the changing foreign currency rates, our distribution net
revenues decreased $25.7 million or 7% year over year. The decrease in absolute dollars of distribution net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2008 was primarily due to the effect of
the termination of a significant customer, which outweighed the beneficial effect of foreign currency rates. Distribution net revenues as a percentage of consolidated net revenues decreased from 26%
for the year ended March 31, 2007 to 14% for the year ended March 31, 2008, primarily due to the significant increase in publishing net revenues.


The
mix of distribution net revenues between hardware and software sales varied slightly year over year with approximately 26% of distribution net revenues from hardware sales for the
year ended March 31, 2008 as compared to 17% for the year ended March 31, 2007. The mix of future distribution net revenues will be driven by a number of factors including the occurrence
of further hardware price reductions instituted by hardware manufacturers, and our ability to establish and maintain distribution agreements with hardware manufacturers, third-party software
publishers and retail customers. For fiscal 2009, we expect distribution net revenues to decrease in absolute dollars due to the full year effect of the termination of the significant customer when
compared to fiscal 2008.

revenues decreased from 52% for the year ended March 31, 2007 to 43% for year ended March 31, 2008. The decrease in "cost of sales—product costs" as a percentage of
consolidated net revenues was partially due to a higher percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, relating to our publishing business which in general carries a lower
percentage "cost of sales—product costs" than our distribution business. Net revenues from our publishing business was 86% of total net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2008 as
compared to 74% for the year ended March 31, 2007. As we increase our presence on the next-generation platforms, publishing net revenues during fiscal 2008 included a larger mix of

Product
development expenses of $269.5 million and $133.1 million represented 11% and 12% of publishing net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007,

technologically advanced nature of those titles, the development costs of those titles that have not yet reached technological feasibility, and exceptional title performance during fiscal 2008 leading
to increased costs for studio performance incentive plans.

Sales
and marketing expenses of $308.1 million and $196.2 million represented 10% and 13% of consolidated net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007,

movie-based releases in the first quarter fiscal 2008, and several marketing programs conducted in the fourth quarter fiscal 2008. As a result of the success of our title releases, our consolidated
net revenues increased by a higher percentage than sales and marketing expenses which led to the decrease of sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of consolidated net revenues.

For
fiscal 2009, we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of consolidated net revenues to increase when compared to fiscal 2008 levels because of the effect of revenue
deferral as previously discussed and the expected spending increases on sales and marketing to grow market share internationally and to support a larger slate of titles planned in fiscal 2009.

2007, respectively. Expenses were higher than prior year primarily due to an increase in headcount related costs due to the expansion of RedOctane to support the growth of the Guitar Hero titles,
increased bonus accruals due to strong financial performances of the Company, costs related to Activision's pending merger with Vivendi Games, the consolidation and related amortization of intangibles
related to DemonWare and Bizarre
Creations (acquired in May 2007 and September 2007, respectively) included in our results of operations, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates.

For
fiscal 2009, we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net revenues to increase when compared to fiscal 2008 levels because of the effect of
revenue deferral as previously discussed although the expenses are expected to be about in line with fiscal 2008.

Publishing
operating income for the year ended March 31, 2008 increased $397.6 million from $64.1 million for fiscal 2007 to $461.7 million for fiscal 2008.
The increase was primarily due to:

•

The
strong performance of our fiscal 2008 titles, leading to the substantial growth in our publishing segment which in general has a higher operating margin than our
distribution segment.

•

Cost
control relative to significant growth in net revenues.

Distribution
operating income for the year ended March 31, 2008 increased over the last fiscal year, from $9.1 million to $17.9 million. The results from the
distribution business have improved primarily due to the effect of foreign currency rates, higher operating margin as a result of the termination of a significant customer that generated limited
operating income, and the strong performance of Activision titles for the year ended March 31, 2008.

The
income tax provision of $186.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2008 reflects our effective income tax rate of 35%. While our effective income tax rate for the year
equals our statutory rate there are certain items that would normally generate a variance between the two rates. Those items are the federal and state research and development tax credits and the
impact of foreign tax rate differentials partially offset by state taxes. However, the net effect for the year is approximately zero.

The
aforementioned effective income tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2008 of 35% differs from our effective income tax rate of 22% for the year ended March 31, 2007
due to an increase in pretax income for fiscal 2008 versus the pretax income for fiscal 2007, without a corresponding increase in the benefit of book/tax differences. The lower effective income tax
rate in fiscal 2007 was also due to the reversal of valuation allowance.

Net Income

Net income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was $344.9 million or $1.10 per diluted earnings per share, as compared to net income of
$85.8 million or $0.28 per diluted earnings per share for the year ended March 31, 2007.

The
increase in consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2007 was driven by the following:

•

Strong
performance of our North American publishing unit led to a year over year increase in net revenues of $43.3 million or 6%. In the third quarter fiscal 2007, we
released a focused but high quality slate of titles, which resulted in strong consumer demand for our new releases in the third quarter, continuing reorders in the fourth quarter and strong price
realization. In fiscal 2007, our major releases included

Call of Duty 3, Guitar Hero 2, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Tony Hawk's Project 8, Over the Hedge, X-Men:
Official Game, Shrek Smash N' Crash, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam

,

Series of Poker Tournament of Champions, Pimp My Ride

, and titles
for our Cabela's History Channel and new Barbie franchises. In fiscal 2006, we released the following


major
releases:

Doom 3

for the Xbox,

Madagascar, Fantastic Four, Ultimate Spider-Man, X-Men Legends II,
THAW, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, GUN, True Crime: New York City, Quake 4, Shrek SuperSlam, The Movies, Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2,

and

World Series of Poker.

•

An
increase in net revenues from our distribution business due to a stronger release schedule for certain third-party publishers, higher revenues from hardware sales related
to the launch of PS3 and Nintendo Wii, as well as ongoing sales of NDS and PSP, and the addition of a significant new customer in the second quarter fiscal 2007.

•

Impact
of the year over year strengthening of the Great Britain Pound ("GBP"), Euro ("EUR") and Australian Dollar ("AUD") in relation to the United States Dollar ("USD").
Foreign exchange rates increased reported net revenues by approximately $51.6 million or 4% for the year
ended March 31, 2007. Excluding the impact of changing foreign currency rates, our consolidated net revenues remained about in line with prior year.

Partially
offset by:

•

A
decrease in publishing net revenues from our European publishing operations primarily due to a more focused slate in fiscal 2007, and a decrease in our affiliate business
as only one title, LucasArts'

Star Wars Lego 2

was released in 2007, whereas two strong affiliate titles, LucasArts'

Star
Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith

and LucasArts'

Star Wars Battlefront II,

were released in fiscal
2006.

North
America publishing net revenues increased 6% from $710.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2006 to $753.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2007.
Although the company released fewer titles in fiscal 2007, the high quality slate drove strong consumer demand and enabled the company to maintain pricing and record lower provisions for returns and
price protection than in fiscal 2006. Net revenues were impacted by strong performances from

Guitar Hero 2, Call of Duty 3, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance

and

Tony Hawk's Project 8

. North America publishing net revenues increased as a percentage of consolidated net revenues from 48% for the year ended
March 31, 2006 to 50% for the year ended March 31, 2007. The increase in the percentage of consolidated net revenues is due to a combination of strong performance in North America and a
decrease in our international publishing net revenues due to a smaller slate and a decrease in the number of affiliate titles in Europe released in fiscal 2007.

International
publishing net revenues decreased by 18% from $444.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2006 to $365.7 million for the year ended March 31,
2007. Additionally, international publishing net revenues as a percentage of consolidated net revenues decreased from 30% for the year ended March 31, 2006 to 24% for the year ended
March 31, 2007. The decrease in international publishing net revenues was primarily due to the decrease in the number of titles released internationally in fiscal 2007. Additionally, in Europe,
our net revenues were impacted by a decrease in revenues from our affiliate titles. Fiscal 2006 included the successful LucasArts' titles,

Star Wars:


Revenge of the Sith

and

Star Wars Battlefront II,

while fiscal 2007 included one major affiliate label release, LucasArts'

Lego Star
Wars II: The Original Trilogy

. The decrease in international publishing net revenues was partially offset by a year over year strengthening of
the EUR and the GBP in relation to the USD, which increased reported net revenues for fiscal 2007 by approximately $24.2 million. Excluding the impact of changing foreign currency rates, our
international publishing net revenues decreased 23% year over year.

Net
revenues from sales of titles for the PC decreased 57% from $183.5 million and 16% of publishing net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2006 to $78.9 million
and 7% of publishing net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2007. The decreases were primarily due to the strong performance of our fiscal 2006 PC releases, as well as a decrease in the
number of titles released for the PC during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2006, we released the highly successful PC title,

Call of Duty

, which was ranked by NPD Funworld as the number two best selling PC title in the United States for the third quarter fiscal 2006, as well as

Quake

Net
revenues from sales of titles for the PS2 increased 19% from $422.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2006 to $500.9 million for the year ended
March 31, 2007. Although we released a fewer number of major titles for the PS2 in fiscal 2007, the strong performance of these releases, particularly the PS2 exclusive title Guitar Hero 2,
resulted in higher net revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of publishing net revenues. The key titles impacting the fiscal 2007 results were

Call of Duty

, the #3 title overall for the third quarter fiscal 2007, according to NPD Funworld, and

Guitar Hero 2

(game and accessories),
the #1 best selling title on the PS2 platform for the third quarter fiscal 2007 per NPD Funworld. In addition, we released

Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Over the Hedge, Tony
Hawk's Project 8, X-Men: The Official Game, Shrek Smash N' Crash Racing

and our European affiliate title, LucasArts'

platform, and according to NPD Funworld, three of our titles,

Call of Duty 3, Tony Hawk's Project 8

and

for these four titles although limited by hardware availability.

March 31, 2007. These decreases were primarily attributable to a slowdown in sales for the Xbox as customers upgrade to the Xbox360, and the reduction in the number of titles released by us for
this platform. In fiscal 2007 we released five major titles for Xbox:

Call of Duty 3, Tony Hawk's Project 8, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Over the Hedge

Net
revenues from sales of titles for the Nintendo GameCube decreased 72% from $81.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2006 to $22.8 million for the year ended

significant slowdown in sales on the GameCube platform as customers transition to the next generation platforms. In fiscal 2006, we released nine major titles:

Madagascar, Tony

and

X-Men Legends 2.

Net revenues from sales of titles for the hand-held platforms decreased 3% from $158.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2006 to $153.4 million for
the year ended March 31, 2007. Hand-held net revenues as a percentage of publishing net revenues decreased slightly from 14% to 13%. Within the hand-held platforms, net
revenues for the GBA platform decreased 39%, from $79.7 million for the prior fiscal year, to $48.5 million for fiscal 2007, PSP decreased by 4%, from $52.0 million to
$49.9 million, and net revenues for the NDS doubled from $27.1 million for fiscal 2006 to $54.9 million for the current year. The decrease in net revenues for GBA is primarily
related to slower GBA sales due to wider acceptance of the NDS platform. The net revenue increase for NDS reflects the strong performance of our key fiscal 2007 titles which includes

Over the Hedge, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam,
X-Men: The Official Game, Spider-Man: Battle for New York

and LucasArts'

Star Wars Lego 2

in Europe, as the platform continued to gain consumer acceptance and market share. PSP
net revenues for fiscal 2007 were slightly lower
than the previous year. In fiscal 2006, we released a stronger PSP slate and our titles performed well with the consumer excitement for the March 2005 North America platform launch, and the September
2005 European platform launch. The 2006 slate included

Tony Hawk's Underground 2, Spider-Man: The Movie 2, X-Men Legends 2, World Series of
Poker,

and two affiliate titles in Europe. Our key releases in fiscal 2007 were

Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Tony Hawk's Project 8, Call of Duty: Roads to
Victory,

and one European affiliate title, LucasArts'

Distribution
net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2007 increased 26% from the prior fiscal year, from $313.3 million to $394.0 million. Foreign exchange rates
increased reported distribution net revenues by approximately $27.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2007. Excluding the impact of the changing foreign currency rates, our
distribution net revenues increased $53.3 million or 17% year over year. This year over year increase was primarily due to the strong releases for certain third-party publishers, increased
hardware sales primarily related to the launch of two new platforms in fiscal 2007, the PS3 and the Nintendo Wii, as well as ongoing sales of NDS and PSP hardware, and the addition of a new customer
in the second quarter fiscal 2007.

The
mix of distribution net revenues between hardware and software sales varied year over year with approximately 17% of distribution net revenues from hardware sales in the year ended
March 31, 2007 as compared to 20% in the prior fiscal year. Fiscal 2007 results included the hardware releases of the Nintendo Wii in November 2006 and the PS3 in late March 2007. Fiscal 2006
included the release of the PSP in Europe in the second quarter and the Xbox360 in November 2005. The mix of future distribution net revenues will be driven by a number of factors including the
occurrence of further hardware price reductions instituted by hardware manufacturers, and our ability to establish and maintain distribution agreements with hardware manufacturers, third-party
software publishers and retail customers.

"Cost
of sales—product costs" represented 52% and 50% of consolidated net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In absolute dollars,
"cost of sales—product costs" increased 9% from $734.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2006 to $799.6 million for the year


ended
March 31, 2007. The primary factors affecting the increase in "cost of sales—product costs" in absolute dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net revenues were:

•

An
increase in consolidated net revenues of 3% from $1,468.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2006 to $1,513.0 million for the year ended
March 31, 2007.

•

A
higher percentage of our business relating to distribution which carries higher product costs than our publishing business.

•

Higher
net revenues from products for console platforms in absolute dollars and as a percentage of publishing net revenues from $812.3 million and 70% of publishing
net revenues in fiscal 2006 to $886.8 million and 80% of publishing net revenues in fiscal 2007. Console products have higher costs of sales—product costs associated with them than
PC products, due to the royalty payments to hardware manufacturers.

Partially
offset by:

•

"Cost
of sales—software royalties and amortization" for the year ended March 31, 2007 decreased as a percentage of publishing net revenues from the prior fiscal year,
from 13% to 12%. In absolute dollars, "cost of sales—software royalties and amortization" for the year ended March 31, 2007 also decreased from the prior fiscal year, from
$147.8 million to $132.4 million. The decreases were mainly due to:

•

A
decrease in the number of titles released in fiscal 2007 as compared to the prior year when we had the largest slate of new releases in our history. A decrease in
amortization of software development costs from internally developed games, was partially offset by increases in royalties for games developed by third party developers.

•

Non-recurring
costs recorded in fiscal 2006 totaling $12.6 million, related to impairment charges for a title in development in 2006, and recoverability
write-offs related to released titles.

same period last year, from $57.7 million to $46.1 million and from 5% to 4%, respectively. The decreases in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of publishing net revenues were due
mainly to a decrease in the number of titles with associated intellectual property in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, we released the following titles with associated intellectual
property:

Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Over the Hedge, X-Men: Official Game, Guitar Hero 1 and 2, Tony Hawk's Project 8

and

Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam

fiscal 2006, we released the following titles with associated intellectual property:

Product
development expenses of $133.1 million and $132.7 million represented 12% and 11% of publishing net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The increases in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues was primarily generated by:

•

Increased
costs incurred to fund more product development capacity at certain studios as well as the addition of Red Octane.

•

Increases
in product development expenses of $4.8 million in fiscal 2007 related to stock-based compensation expense as a result of the implementation of SFAS
No. 123R.

•

Compensation
provided to employees in fiscal 2007 to cure tax penalties related to previously-exercised stock options.

Partially
offset by:

•

Product
cancellation charges of $11.4 million, including termination fees, incurred during fiscal 2006. Given the market conditions, the lower than expected
performance of some of our third quarter fiscal 2006 releases, and risks associated with console transition, we performed a thorough review of the then pending product slate. To better align
opportunities associated with the next-generation console platforms with income potential and risks associated with certain titles in development, we canceled development of certain titles
and permanently removed them from our future title slate. There were no product cancellation charges during fiscal 2007.

•

The
implementation during fiscal 2007 of certain cost control initiatives including sharing technologies and tools across multiple platforms and studios, increasing our
development schedules to facilitate a longer pre-production phase and more predictable workflow times, and outsourcing certain areas of game development to lower cost service providers.

Sales
and marketing expenses of $196.2 million and $283.4 million represented 13% and 19% of consolidated net revenues for the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The decrease in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues was a result of the implementation of a more targeted media program which worked more efficiently helped by the
overall strength and high quality of our fiscal 2007 title slate. We also released fewer titles in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, when we had the largest slate of new releases in our history.
The decreases were partially offset by expenses of $5.1 million in fiscal 2007 related to stock-based compensation expense as a result of the implementation of SFAS No. 123R, as well as
sales and marketing expenses associated with the acquisition of the Guitar Hero franchise.

General

consolidation of RedOctane into our results of operations, amortization of intangible assets related to the RedOctane acquisition, and stock-based compensation expense of $10.0 million in
fiscal 2007 as a result of the implementation of SFAS No. 123R. These increases were partially offset by the benefits of our cost optimization program launched in the fourth quarter fiscal 2006
and gains on foreign currency.

Publishing
operating income for the year ended March 31, 2007 increased $70.8 million from the same period last year, from an operating loss of $6.7 million to
operating income of $64.1 million. The increase was primarily due to:

•

The
strong performance of our fiscal 2007 titles.

•

A
decrease in provision for returns and price protection in fiscal 2007 from 18% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2006 compared to 9% of consolidated net revenues in
fiscal 2007, primarily due to improved market conditions and stronger sell through of our 2007 title releases.

•

A
significant decrease in sales and marketing spending as a result of improved efficiency in executing our marketing programs.

•

The
implementation of certain cost control initiatives resulting in decreased product development and general and administrative expenses (excluding expenses related to our
internal review of historical stock option granting practices and expenses relating to the informal SEC inquiry and derivative litigation).

•

Fiscal
2006 results included cancellation, impairment, and earn-out recoverability charges totaling $24.0 million. See additional description of charges
incurred in the cost of sales—software royalties and amortization and the product development discussions.

•

Fiscal
2006 results also included write-downs of inventory costs of $14.5 million. See additional description in the cost of sales—product costs
discussion.

Partially
offset by:

•

Stock-based
compensation expenses of $22.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 as a result of the implementation of SFAS No. 123R.

•

Legal
and other professional fees of $26.9 million associated with our internal review of historical stock option granting practices, including expenses relating to
the informal SEC inquiry and derivative litigation.

•

Amortization
of intangible assets related to the RedOctane acquisition of $11.7 million.

Distribution
operating income for the year ended March 31, 2007 decreased over the same period last year, from $21.9 million to $9.1 million. The decrease in
operating income in 2007 was primarily due to increased business from large mass-market customers for which we earn smaller margins, an


increase
in hardware sales which carries a lower margin than software, and higher reserves for inventory obsolescence.

The
income tax provision of $24.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2007 reflects our effective income tax rate of 22%. This is higher than prior years as a result of an
increase in pretax income for the year ended March 31, 2007, versus the amount of pretax income for the year ended March 31, 2006, without a corresponding increase in the benefit of
book/tax differences. The significant items that generated the variance between our effective rate and our statutory rate of 35% were research and development tax credits, the impact of foreign tax
rate differentials, and the elimination of the valuation allowance for research and development tax credits, partially offset by state taxes and the establishment of tax reserves for these credits and
other deferred tax assets.

Net Income

Net income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was $85.8 million or $0.28 per diluted share, as compared to $40.3 million or $0.14 per diluted
share for the year ended March 31, 2006.

Selected Quarterly Operating Results

Our quarterly operating results have in the past varied significantly and will likely vary significantly in the future, depending on numerous factors, several of
which are not under our control. See Item 1A—"Risk Factors." Our business also has experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant seasonality, largely due to
consumer buying patterns and our product release schedule focusing on those patterns. Net revenues typically are significantly higher during the fourth calendar quarter, primarily due to the increased
demand for consumer software during the year-end holiday buying season. Accordingly, we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful
and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.

As
of March 31, 2008, our primary source of liquidity is comprised of $1,396.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $53.0 million of short-term
investments. Over the last two years, our primary sources of liquidity have included cash on hand at the beginning of the year and cash flows generated from continuing operations. We have also
generated cash flows from the issuance of our common stock to employees through the exercise of options, which is described in more detail below in "Cash Flows from Financing Activities." We have not
utilized debt financing as a significant source of cash flows. However, we do have available at certain of our international locations credit facilities, which are described below in "Credit
Facilities," that can be utilized if needed.

Following
the closing of our proposed business combination with Vivendi Games, Inc. (see Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8), Activision Blizzard, Inc. ("Activision Blizzard") will commence a cash tender offer for up to 146.5 million of its shares at $27.50 per share. If the tender offer is
fully subscribed, the aggregate consideration will be approximately $4.028 billion. Under the terms of the business combination agreement ("BCA"), we and Vivendi S.A. ("Vivendi") have
agreed the purchase of the shares tendered in the tender offer will be funded as follows: (a) the first $2.928 billion of the aggregate consideration will be funded by Activision
Blizzard with proceeds from the share purchase described in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, available cash on hand and, if necessary,
borrowings made under one or more new credit facilities; (b) if the aggregate consideration is more than $2.928 billion, Vivendi has agreed to purchase from Activision Blizzard, at a
purchase price of $27.50 per share, additional newly issued shares of Activision Blizzard common stock in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) $700.0 million and (y) the excess of
the aggregate consideration over $2.928 billion, which amount will be used to fund the amount of the aggregate consideration that is in excess of $2.928 billion; and (c) if the
aggregate consideration exceeds $3.628 billion, Activision Blizzard will fund the additional amount of the aggregate consideration that is in excess of $3.628 billion (up to the maximum
aggregate consideration of $4.028 billion) through borrowings made under the new credit facilities issued by Vivendi (see below and Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8.)

On
April 29, 2008, we, acting on behalf of Activision Blizzard, entered into a senior unsecured credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Vivendi. Borrowings under the Credit
Agreement cannot be
effected until the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement described above (the "Transactions.") After the closing of the Transactions, among other things,
the Company's name will be changed to Activision Blizzard.

After
the closing of the Transactions, the Credit Agreement will provide Activision Blizzard with (i) a term loan credit facility (the "Tranche A Facility") in an aggregate
amount of up to $400.0 million to be applied to fund that portion of the post-closing tender offer consideration in excess of


$3.628 billion
as set forth in the BCA, (ii) a term loan credit facility (the "Tranche B Facility") in an aggregate amount of up to $150.0 million to be applied to repay
certain indebtedness of Vivendi Games after the closing in accordance with the terms of the BCA, and (iii) a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility," and collectively with the
Tranche A Facility and the Tranche B Facility, the "New Credit Facilities") in an aggregate amount of up to $475.0 million to be used after the closing of the Transactions for
general corporate purposes. In the event the BCA terminates prior to the closing of the Transactions, the New Credit Facilities will terminate effective on the same date (see Note 21 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8).

We
believe that we have sufficient working capital ($1,423.3 million at March 31, 2008), as well as proceeds available from our international credit facilities, to finance
our operational requirements for at least the next twelve months, including purchases of inventory and equipment, the funding of the development, production, marketing and sale of new products, the
acquisition of intellectual property rights for future products from third parties and the completion of the tender offer in connection with the combination with Vivendi Games.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

The primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities typically have included the collection of customer receivables generated by the sale of our
products, offset by payments to vendors for the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of our products, third-party developers and intellectual property holders, and our own employees. For the years
ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, cash flows from operating activities were $573.5 million and $27.2 million, respectively. The principal components comprising cash flows from
operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2008 included an increase in amounts collected from customers due to increased net revenues, an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses
and other liabilities partially offset by the increase in inventory and accounts receivables. See an analysis of the change in key balance sheet accounts below in "Key Balance Sheet Accounts." We
expect that a primary source of future liquidity, both short-term and long-term, will be the result of cash flows from continuing operations.

A
significant operating use of our cash relates to our continued investment in software development and intellectual property licenses. We spent approximately $168.8 million and
$166.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, in connection with the acquisition of publishing or distribution rights for products being developed by third
parties, the execution of new license agreements granting us long-term rights to intellectual property of third parties, as well as the capitalization of product development costs relating
to internally developed products. We expect that we will continue to make significant expenditures relating to our investment in software development and intellectual property licenses. Our future
cash commitments relating to these investments are detailed below in "Commitments." Cash flows from operations are affected by our ability to release highly successful or "hit" titles. Though many of
these titles have substantial production or acquisition costs and marketing expenditures, once a title recoups these costs, incremental net revenues typically will directly and positively impact cash
flows.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

The primary source of cash used in investing activities typically have included capital expenditures, acquisitions of privately held interactive software
development companies and publishing companies, and the net effect of purchases and sales/maturities of short-term investment vehicles. The goal of our investments is to maximize return
while minimizing risk, maintaining liquidity, coordinating with anticipated working capital needs, and providing for prudent investment diversification.

For
the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, cash flows provided by and used in investing activities were $326.3 million and $35.2 million, respectively. For the
year ended March 31, 2008, cash


flows
provided by investing activities were primarily the result of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, as offset by cash paid for business acquisitions, capital expenditures, and
purchases of short-term investments. The increase in cash flows provided by investing activities versus the prior year was primarily related to our investment activities as we had a bigger
net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, particularly in the fourth quarter fiscal 2008 as compared to that of fiscal 2007. Such activities were carried out in anticipation of the close
of the BCA with Vivendi and the related tender offer (see Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8), and are part of the reason for the substantial
increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1 billion. We have historically financed our acquisitions through the issuance of shares of common stock or a combination of common stock
and cash.

Due
to uncertainties surrounding the timing of liquidation of our auction rate securities, which are comprised of AAA-rated student-loan-backed
taxable securities, all our investments in such securities were classified as long-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2008. Liquidity for these
auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, usually
every 7 to 35 days. On an
industry-wide basis, many auctions have failed, and there is, as yet, no meaningful secondary market for these instruments. Each of the auction rate securities in our investment portfolio
as of March 31, 2008 has experienced a failed auction and there is no assurance that future auctions for these securities will succeed. An auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell
their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers. In the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a
contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar short-term instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to earn
interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities or they mature. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully
recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or not exist.

As
there is not yet any meaningful secondary market for these securities, quoted market prices are not available. We estimated the fair market value using valuation models, which take
into account both observable market data and non-observable factors, including credit quality, duration, insurance wraps, collateral composition, maximum rate formulas, comparable trading
instruments, and likelihood of redemption. Accordingly, we consider the values generated by such valuation models to represent management's best estimate of fair value for the purposes of applying the
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

.

The
change in fair value of the auction rate securities of $4.3 million was recorded as a component of comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in
Shareholders' Equity for the year ended March 31, 2008, as the decline in fair value is not considered to be "other-than-temporary." We have the intent and ability to
hold these securities for a period of time sufficient for a recovery of fair value up to (or beyond) the initial cost of the investment.

Based
on our other available cash and expected operating cash flows and financing, we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to
execute our current business plan or to consummate the proposed post-closing tender offer described in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8. Additionally we have received indications from certain lenders that we may borrow against the par value of the securities at competitive rates.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

The primary source of cash from financing activities has been transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to
employees. We have not utilized debt


financing
as a significant source of cash flows. However, we do have available at certain of our international locations, credit facilities, which are described below in "Credit Facilities," that can
be utilized if needed.

For
the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, cash flows provided by financing activities were $105.2 million and $28.0 million, respectively. The increase in cash
provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2008 was the result of the issuance of common stock related to employee equity incentive and stock purchase plans. The increase in
stock option exercises was primarily due to the performance of our share price and the release in June 2007 of the suspension of stock option exercises implemented while we were not current with the
filings we are required to make pursuant to the Exchange Act.

During
fiscal 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a buyback program under which we can repurchase up to $350.0 million of our common stock. Under the program, shares may be
purchased as determined by management and within certain guidelines, from time to time, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including privately negotiated structured stock
repurchase transactions and through transactions in the options markets. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to
time without prior notice. As of March 31, 2008, we had approximately $226.2 million available for utilization under the buyback program. We actively manage our capital structure as a
component of our overall business strategy. Accordingly, in the future, when we determine that market conditions are appropriate, we may seek to achieve long term value for the shareholders through,
among other things, new debt or equity financings or refinancings, share repurchases, and other transactions involving our equity or debt securities.

leading to higher net revenues for the fourth quarter fiscal 2008 of

Reserves
for returns, price protection and bad debt increased from $91.4 million at March 31, 2007 to $129.4 million at March 31, 2008 whereas reserves as a

compared to the fourth quarter fiscal 2007. Reserves for returns and price protection are a function of the number of units and pricing of titles in retail inventory, which has been consistently
applied. (see description of

Intellectual
property licenses decreased from $100.3 million at March 31, 2007 to $83.6 million at March 31, 2008. The decrease in intellectual property
licenses primarily resulted from the amortization of intellectual property licenses upon releases of titles during fiscal 2008.

The
increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily driven by:

•

Taxes
payable as a result of improved profitability leading to utilization of all of our net operating loss carryforwards.

•

Increased
annual bonuses as a result of our record financial performance.

•

Increased
royalties payable due to higher net revenues.

See
Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for details of accrued expenses and other liabilities.


Capital Requirements

For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $35.6 million. Capital expenditures will be
primarily for computer hardware and software purchases and various corporate projects.

Credit Facilities

We have revolving credit facilities with our Centresoft subsidiary located in the UK (the "UK Facility") and our NBG subsidiary located in Germany (the "German
Facility.")

The
UK Facility provided Centresoft with the ability to borrow up to GBP 12.0 million ($23.9 million), including issuing letters of credit, on a revolving basis as of
March 31, 2008. Furthermore, under the UK Facility, Centresoft provided a GBP 0.6 million ($1.2 million) guarantee for the benefit of our CD Contact subsidiary as of
March 31, 2008. The UK Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.0% as of March 31, 2008, is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and expires in March 2009.
The UK Facility also contains various covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios related to, among others, fixed charges. As of March 31, 2008, we were in
compliance with these covenants.

The
German Facility provided for revolving loans up to EUR 0.5 million ($0.8 million) as of March 31, 2008, bore interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus 2.5%, is
collateralized by certain of the subsidiary's property and equipment and has no expiration date. No borrowings were outstanding against the German Facility as of March 31, 2008.

As
of March 31, 2008, we maintained a $10.0 million irrevocable standby letter of credit. The standby letter of credit is required by one of our inventory manufacturers to
qualify for payment terms on our inventory purchases. Under the terms of this arrangement, we are required to maintain on deposit with
the bank a compensating balance, restricted as to use, of not less than the sum of the available amount of the letter of credit plus the aggregate amount of any drawings under the letter of credit
that have been honored thereunder but not reimbursed. At March 31, 2008, the $10.0 million deposit is included in short-term investments as restricted cash. No borrowings
were outstanding as of March 31, 2008.

As
of March 31, 2008, our publishing subsidiary located in the UK maintained a EUR 7.0 million ($11.0 million) irrevocable standby letter of credit. The standby
letter of credit is required by one of our inventory manufacturers to qualify for payment terms on our inventory purchases. The standby letter of credit does not require a compensating balance and is
collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and expires in February 2009. No borrowings were outstanding as of March 31, 2008.

Commitments

In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for non-cancelable operating lease agreements for our
offices, for the development of products, as well as for the rights to intellectual property. Under these agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor, developer, or intellectual
property holder, based upon contractual arrangements. Typically, the payments to third-party developers are conditioned upon the achievement by the developers of contractually specified development
milestones. These payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders typically are deemed to be advances and are recoupable against future royalties earned by the developer or
intellectual property holder based on the sale of the related game. Additionally, in connection with certain intellectual property right acquisitions and development agreements, we will commit to
spend specified amounts for marketing support for the related game(s) which is to be developed or in which the intellectual property will be utilized. Additionally, we lease certain of our


facilities
and equipment under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. Assuming all contractual provisions are met, the total future minimum commitments for these and other contractual
arrangements in place as of March 31, 2008, are scheduled to be paid as follows (amounts in thousands):

We
have omitted FIN 48 liabilities from this table due to the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of potential issue resolution. Specifically, either (a) the
underlying positions have not been fully enough developed under audit to quantify at this time or, (b) the years relating to the issues for certain jurisdictions are not currently under audit.
At the adoption date of April 1, 2007, we had $65.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits. At March 31, 2008, we had $74.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of March 31, 2008 and 2007, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, such as entities often referred to as
structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited
purposes. As such, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements and are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.

Financial Disclosure

We maintain internal control over financial reporting, which generally include those controls relating to the preparation of our financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also are focused on our "disclosure controls and procedures," which as defined by the Securities and
Exchange Commission are generally those controls and procedures designed to ensure that financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission is reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is communicated to management,
including our Chief Executive Officers and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our
Disclosure Committee, which operates under the Board approved Disclosure Committee Charter and Disclosure Controls & Procedures Policy, includes senior management
representatives and assists executive management in its oversight of the accuracy and timeliness of our disclosures, as well as in implementing and evaluating our overall disclosure process. As part
of our disclosure process, senior finance and operational representatives from all of our corporate divisions and business units prepare quarterly reports regarding their current quarter operational
performance, future trends, subsequent events, internal controls, changes in internal controls, and other accounting and disclosure-


relevant
information. These quarterly reports are reviewed by certain key corporate finance representatives. These corporate finance representatives also conduct quarterly interviews on a rotating
basis with the preparers of selected quarterly reports. The results of the quarterly reports and related interviews are reviewed by the Disclosure Committee. Finance representatives also conduct
reviews with our senior management team, our internal and external counsel, and other appropriate personnel involved in the disclosure process, as appropriate. Additionally, senior finance and
operational representatives provide internal certifications regarding the accuracy of information they provide that is utilized in the preparation of our periodic public reports filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Financial results and other financial information also are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. As required by
applicable regulatory requirements, the Chief Executive Officers and the Chief Financial Officer review and make various certifications regarding the accuracy of our periodic public reports filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting. With the assistance of the Disclosure Committee, we will continue to
assess and monitor our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, and will make refinements as necessary.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

("SFAS No. 141(R).")
This Statement provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. It requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction, establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and requires
the acquirer to disclose the nature and financial effect of the business combination. Also in December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160.

Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements

("SFAS No. 160.") This Statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements,

to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a
subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 are required to be adopted simultaneously and are effective for the first annual reporting period
beginning on or after December 15, 2008 with earlier adoption being prohibited. We do not currently have any non-controlling interests in our subsidiaries, and accordingly the
adoption of SFAS No. 160 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact from the adoption of SFAS No. 141R on our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157 ("SFAS No. 157"),

Fair Value Measurements.

SFAS No. 157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to other
accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007 for financial assets and liabilities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for non-financial assets and liabilities. The
adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

("SFAS No. 159.") SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items
at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in
earnings. The provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 is not
expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.


In June 2007, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force's ("EITF") consensus conclusion on EITF 07-03,

Accounting for Advance Payments
for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development.

EITF 07-03 addresses the diversity which exists with respect to the accounting for the
non-refundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities. Under this conclusion, an entity is required to defer and
capitalize non-refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
EITF 07-03 is effective for interim or annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 and requires prospective application for new contracts
entered into after the effective date. The adoption of EITF 07-03 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 133

("SFAS No. 161.") SFAS No. 161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are
required to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under
Statement No. 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash
flows. The guidance in SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application
encouraged. SFAS No. 161 encourages, but does not require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 161.

Inflation

Our management currently believes that inflation has not had a material impact on continuing operations.

Item 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest
rates, currency exchange rates, and market prices. Our market risk sensitive instruments are classified as instruments entered into for purposes "other than trading." Our views on market risk are not
necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur, since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based
upon actual fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates, market prices, and the timing of transactions.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial instruments in
our investment portfolio. We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio consisting primarily of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average
maturities. We also manage our interest rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity. As of
March 31, 2008, our cash equivalents and short-term investments included debt securities of $1,171.4 million. Also, as of March 31, 2008, we classified our investments
in auction rate securities of $91.2 million as long-term investments (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for summary of
significant accounting policies.)

Our

Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We transact business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates,
particularly EUR, GBP, and AUD. The volatility of EUR, GBP, and AUD (and all other applicable currencies) will be monitored frequently throughout the coming year. When appropriate, we enter into
hedging transactions in order to mitigate our risk from currency fluctuations. We will continue to use hedging programs in the future and may use currency forward contracts, currency options, and/or
other derivative financial instruments commonly utilized to reduce financial market risks if it is determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk. We do not hold or purchase
any currency contracts for trading purposes. As of March 31, 2008, we had no outstanding exchange forward contracts. As of March 31, 2007, accrued expenses included approximately $90,000
of pre-tax unrealized losses for the estimated fair value of outstanding currency exchange forward contracts.

Market Price Risk

With regard to the structured stock repurchase transactions described in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8, at those times when we have structured stock repurchase transactions outstanding, it is possible that at settlement we could take delivery of shares at an effective repurchase price
higher than the then market price. As of March 31, 2008, we had no structured stock repurchase transactions outstanding.

Item 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

1) Definition and Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are
designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will
detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. Inherent
limitations to any system of disclosure controls and procedures include, but are not limited to, the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of such controls by one or more
persons. In addition, we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, and our system of controls may
therefore not achieve its desired objectives under all possible future events.

2) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of March 31, 2008. Based on this controls evaluation, and subject to the limitations described above, the Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis.

3) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15(f). Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of
March 31, 2008, of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2008.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.


The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2008 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

4) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are
reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Activision, Inc.:

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 8, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Activision, Inc. and its subsidiaries at March 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under Item 8 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's
management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation in fiscal 2007. As discussed in
Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2008.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ACTIVISION, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Activision, Inc. ("Activision," the "Company," or "we") is a leading international publisher of interactive entertainment software and peripheral products.
We have built a company with a diverse portfolio of products that spans a wide range of categories and target markets and that is used on a variety of game hardware platforms and operating systems. We
have created, licensed, and acquired a group of highly recognizable franchises, which we market to a variety of consumer demographics. Our products cover diverse game categories including
action/adventure, action sports, racing, role-playing, simulation, first-person action, music-based gaming and strategy. Our target customer base ranges from casual players to game
enthusiasts, children to adults, and mass-market consumers to "value" buyers. We currently offer our products primarily in versions that operate on the Sony PlayStation 2 ("PS2"),
Sony PlayStation 3 ("PS3"), Nintendo Wii ("Wii"), and Microsoft Xbox 360 ("Xbox360") console systems, Sony PlayStation Portable ("PSP"), and Nintendo Dual Screen ("NDS")
hand-held devices, and the personal computer ("PC"). In prior years, we have also offered our products on the Sony PlayStation ("PS1"), Microsoft Xbox ("Xbox"), Nintendo GameCube ("NGC"),
Nintendo Game Boy Advance ("GBA"), and Nintendo 64 ("N64") console systems, and the Nintendo Game Boy Color ("GBC") hand-held device.

Our
publishing business involves the development, marketing, and sale of products directly, by license, or through our affiliate label program with certain third-party publishers. Our
distribution business consists of operations in Europe that provide logistical and sales services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and
manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

We
maintain operations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom ("UK"), Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, Australia, Sweden, South Korea, Norway, and the Netherlands. In
fiscal 2008, operations outside of North America contributed approximately 39% of consolidated net revenues.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Activision, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments

Cash and cash equivalents include cash, money markets, and short-term investments with original maturities of not more than 90 days.

Short-term
investments generally mature between three and thirty months. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on
their liquid nature and because such securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All other investments that are not classified as short-term are
classified as long-term investments. All of our investments are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair market value with unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) reported, net of taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity. The specific identification method is used to determine the cost of
securities disposed with realized gains and losses reflected in investment income, net.

ACTIVISION, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Restricted Cash—Compensating Balances

We maintained an irrevocable standby letter of credit in the amount of a $10.0 million as of March 31, 2008 and $7.5 million as of
March 31, 2007. The standby letter of credit is required by one of our inventory manufacturers to qualify for payment terms on our inventory purchases. Under the terms of this arrangement, we
are required to maintain with the issuing bank a compensating balance, restricted as to use, of not less than the sum of the available amount of the letter of credit plus the aggregate amount of any
drawings under the letter of credit that have been honored thereunder but not reimbursed. At March 31, 2008 and 2007, $11.6 million and $7.5 million, respectively, of restricted
cash is included in short-term investments, most of which is related to that standby letter of credit.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments and accounts receivable. We
place our temporary cash investments with financial institutions. At various times during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, we
had deposits in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") limit at these financial institutions.

Our
customer base includes retail outlets and distributors, including mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game specialty stores in
the United States and countries worldwide. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses. We generally do not require collateral or other
security from our customers. We had two customers, Wal-Mart and GameStop, that accounted for 14% and 13% of consolidated net revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 and
17% and 10% of consolidated gross accounts receivable at March 31, 2008, respectively. These customers were customers of both our publishing and distribution businesses. We had two customers,
Wal-Mart and Gamestop, that accounted for 22% and 8% of consolidated net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2007 and 26% and 6% of consolidated gross accounts receivable at
March 31, 2007, respectively. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, our two largest customers, Wal-Mart and GameStop, accounted for 22% and 10% of consolidated net
revenues, respectively.

Financial Instruments

The estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies described below. However,
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein may not be indicative of the amounts that we could
realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses have been recorded at the fair value due to their short-term nature.
Short-term investments are carried at fair value with fair values estimated based on quoted market prices. Long-term investments are comprised of AAA-rated student
loan backed taxable auction rate securities. On an industry-wide basis, many auctions have failed, including those for our auction rate securities, and as of yet, a meaningful secondary
market for these instruments has not emerged. As a result, quoted market prices are not available, and we estimated the fair market value using valuation models, which take into account both

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

observable
market data and non-observable factors including credit quality, duration, insurance wraps, collateral composition, maximum rate formulas, comparable trading instruments, and
likelihood of redemption. Accordingly, we consider the values generated by such valuation models to represent management's best estimate of fair value for the purposes of applying the Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

.

We
account for derivative instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

, SFAS No. 138,

Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities

, an amendment of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 149,

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

. SFAS No. 133, 138, and 149 require that all derivatives, including foreign exchange contracts, be recognized in the balance sheet in other assets or
liabilities at their fair value.

We
utilize forward contracts in order to reduce financial market risks. These instruments are used to hedge foreign currency exposures of underlying assets or liabilities. Our accounting
policies for these instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as hedging transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, are
highly effective, and qualify as hedging instruments, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any ineffective portion of a derivative's
change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify as hedging instruments are recorded in earnings. The fair value of foreign currency
contracts is estimated based on the spot rate of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period. As of March 31, 2008, we had no outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts. As of
March 31, 2007, accrued expenses included approximately $90,000 of pre-tax unrealized losses for the estimated fair value of outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts.

Software Development Costs and Intellectual Property Licenses

Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for internally
developed products.

We
account for software development costs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed

. Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are
determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product encompasses both technical design documentation and game design documentation. Significant management judgments and estimates are
utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Technological feasibility is
evaluated on a product-by-product basis. Prior to a product's release, we expense, as part of "cost of sales—software royalties and amortization," capitalized costs
when we believe such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation. Amounts
related to software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to product development expense.

Commencing
upon product release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "cost of sales—software royalties and amortization" based on the ratio of current
revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months or less.

F-8

ACTIVISION, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Intellectual
property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks, copyrights, software, technology, music or other
intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our products. Depending upon the agreement with the rights holder, we may obtain the rights to use acquired intellectual property in
multiple products over multiple years, or alternatively, for a single product. Prior to the related product's release, we expense, as part of "cost of sales—intellectual property
licenses," capitalized intellectual property costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable. Capitalized intellectual property costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned are
charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation.

Commencing
upon the related product's release, capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to "cost of sales—intellectual property licenses" based on the
ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed property will be utilized. As intellectual property license contracts may extend
for multiple years, the amortization of capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year.

We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior
periods, the primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance
of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed trademark or copyright is to be used. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance
of comparable products developed with comparable technology; orders for the product prior to its release; and, for any sequel product, estimated performance based on the performance of the product on
which the sequel is based. Further, as many of our intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple years, we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual
property license costs based on certain qualitative factors, such as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property, whether there are any future
planned theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property, and the rights holder's continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property.

Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the
assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than, and/or
revised forecasted or actual costs are greater than, the original forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in
any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Additionally, as noted above, as many of our intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple years, we also
assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual
property license costs based on certain qualitative factors such as the success of other products and/or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property, whether there are any future
planned theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property and the rights holder's continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property. Material differences may
result in the amount and timing of charges for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in evaluating these qualitative factors.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
estimated useful lives or the lease term: buildings, 25 to 33 years; computer equipment, office furniture and other equipment, 2 to 5 years; leasehold improvements, through the life of
the lease. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed and any resulting gains or losses are recognized in current operations.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We account for goodwill using the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

. ("SFAS No. 142.") Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and is not amortized but rather tested at least annually for
impairment at the reporting unit level. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of goodwill is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Our impairment tests as
of March 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 did not indicate that goodwill was impaired. Our reporting units are determined based on the guidance provided by SFAS No. 142 and EITF
Issue D-101 "Clarification of Reporting Unit Guidance in Paragraph 30 of SFAS No. 142," and at March 31, 2008 consisted of our publishing and distribution operating
segments. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we have not amortized goodwill during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible
assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets

("SFAS
No. 144") when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company determined there was no impairment of intangible assets for the years ended
March 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers, and once any performance obligations have been
completed. Certain products are sold to customers with a street date (the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products we recognize revenue on the later of the street
date or the sale date. Revenue from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection. With respect to license agreements that provide customers the
right to make multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenue is recognized upon delivery of a master copy. Per copy royalties on sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned.
Some of our software products provide limited online features at no additional cost to the consumer. Generally, we consider such features to be incidental to the overall product offering and an
inconsequential deliverable. Accordingly, we do not defer any revenue related to products containing these limited online features. In instances where online features or additional functionality is
considered a substantive deliverable in addition to the software product, we take this into account when applying our revenue recognition policy. This evaluation is performed for each software product
when it is released. In fiscal 2008, we determined that one of our software titles,

Enemy Territory: Quake Wars

(which is primarily an online
multiplayer personal computer ("PC") game), contains online functionality that constitutes a more-than-inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product,
principally because of its importance to game play. As such, our performance obligations for this title extend beyond the sale

F-10

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

of
the game, which is unique compared to other previously released titles. Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ("VSOE") does not exist for the online functionality, as we do not
separately charge for this component of the title. As a result, we are recognizing all of the revenue from the sale of this title ratably over an estimated service period, which is currently estimated
to be six months beginning the month after shipment. In addition, we are deferring the costs of sales for this title, which includes: manufacturing costs, software royalties and amortization, and
intellectual property licenses. Overall, online play functionality is still an emerging area for us. As we move forward, we will monitor this developing functionality and its significance for our
products.

With
respect to online transactions, such as electronic downloads of titles or product add-ons, revenue is recognized when the fee is paid by the online customer to purchase
online content and we are notified by the online retailer that the product has been downloaded. In addition, in order to recognize revenue for both product sales and licensing transactions, persuasive
evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection of the related receivable must be probable.

Sales
incentives or other consideration given by us to our customers is accounted for in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF")
Issue 01-9,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's Products

). In accordance with
EITF Issue 01-9, sales incentives and other consideration that are considered adjustments of the selling price of our products, such as rebates and product placement fees, are reflected as
reductions of revenue. Sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received, such as the appearance of our products in a customer's national
circular ad, are reflected as sales and marketing expenses.

Allowances for Returns, Price Protection, Doubtful Accounts, and Inventory Obsolescence

We closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other publishers, and the anticipated
timing of other releases in order to assess future demands of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent reorders are evaluated to ensure that quantities are
sufficient to meet the demands from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel. We benchmark units to be shipped to our customers using
historical and industry data.

We
may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the circumstances when we elect to
decrease the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and applicable, allows customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and/or
future invoices. The conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or price protection are, among other things, compliance with applicable payment terms, and consistent
delivery to us of inventory and sell-through reports. We may also consider other factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other market factors.
Management must make estimates of potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product revenue. We estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for
current period product revenue utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer. The following factors are
used to estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for a particular title: historical performance of titles in similar genres; historical performance of the hardware platform;
historical performance of the franchise; console hardware life cycle; Activision sales force and retail customer feedback; industry pricing; weeks of on-hand retail

channel
inventory; absolute quantity of on-hand retail channel inventory; our warehouse on-hand inventory levels; the title's recent sell-through history (if
available); marketing trade programs; and competing titles. The relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other items, genre, platform, seasonality, and sales
strategy. Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period. Based upon
historical experience we believe our estimates are reasonable. However, actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a number of reasons including,
among others, a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor, or technological obsolescence due to the emergence of new hardware
platforms. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if factors or market conditions change or if management makes different judgments or utilizes
different estimates in determining the allowances for returns and price protection. For example, a 1% change in our March 31, 2008 allowance for returns and price protection would impact net
revenues by $1.3 million.

Similarly,
management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze the age of current outstanding
account balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes in our customers' payment terms and their economic condition, as well
as whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance. Any significant changes in any of these criteria would affect management's estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts.

We
value inventory at the lower of cost or market. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and in the retail channel and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory
based on the future expected demand for our products. Significant changes in demand for our products would impact management's estimates in establishing our inventory provision.

Shipping and Handling

Shipping and handling costs, which consist primarily of packaging and transportation charges incurred to move finished goods to customers, are included in "cost
of sales—product costs."

Advertising Expenses

We expense advertising as incurred, except for production costs associated with media advertising which are deferred and charged to expense the first time the
related ad is run. Advertising expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 were approximately $180.3 million, $98.4 million, and $192.6 million,
respectively, and are included in sales and marketing expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes using Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,

Accounting for Income
Taxes

("SFAS No. 109.") Under SFAS No. 109, income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable

F-12

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are their local currencies. All assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period, and revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are
reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income includes net income, unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on short-term and long-term investments and foreign
currency translation adjustments.

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities or the disclosure of gain or loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for all
periods. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, increased by common stock equivalents.
Common stock equivalents are calculated using the treasury stock method and represent incremental shares issuable upon exercise of our outstanding options and warrants. However, potential common
shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is
recorded.

Stock-Based Compensation

On April 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based
Payment

("SFAS No. 123R"), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors
including employee stock options and employee stock purchases made pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("employee stock purchases,") based on estimated fair values. SFAS No. 123R
supersedes our previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

("APB
No. 25.") In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107,

Share-
Based Payment

("SAB No. 107") relating to SFAS No. 123R. We have applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 in our adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

F-13

ACTIVISION, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

We
adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of April 1, 2006, the first day of
our fiscal 2007. Therefore, commencing from our fiscal 2007, the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123R. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements
for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS No. 123R in accordance with the modified prospective transition method. See Note 14 for
additional information.

In
November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. FAS 123(R)-3,

Transition Election
Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards

("FSP No. 123R-3.") We have elected not to adopt the alternative transition method
provided in the FSP No. 123R-3 for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123R. We followed paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123R
to calculate the initial pool ("APIC pool") of excess tax benefits and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee
stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

SFAS
No. 123R requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the measurement date using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the
award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under
SFAS No. 123R for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2007 was $53.6 million and $25.5 million, respectively. Prior to the adoption of SFAS
No. 123R, the Company accounted for stock-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25 as allowed under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

("SFAS No. 123.") Under APB No. 25, compensation expense was
recorded for the issuance of stock options and other stock-based compensation based on the intrinsic value of the stock options and other stock-based compensation on the date of grant or measurement
date. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation expense was recorded on the measurement date only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the stock option or other
stock-based award's exercise price. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, we recognized $3.1 million in stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options and
restricted stock, under APB No. 25. See Note 14 for additional information.

Stock-based
compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period.
Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 includes compensation expense for share-based payment awards
granted prior to,
but not yet vested as of, April 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS No. 123, and compensation expense for the
share-based payment awards granted subsequent to April 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. As stock-based
compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for
estimated forfeitures. SFAS No. 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates.

Bizarre Creations

On September 26, 2007, we acquired 100% of Bizarre Creations Limited ("Bizarre Creations") for an aggregate purchase price of $67.4 million in cash.
In addition, in the event that certain financial
performance measures of Bizarre Creations' business over a certain period of time (currently estimated to be 5 years from fiscal 2008) exceed specified target levels, the former shareholders of
Bizarre Creations will be entitled to an additional amount of up to $40.0 million payable in shares of our common stock. The contingent consideration will be recorded as an addition to the
purchase price if the specified target levels are met. Based in the United Kingdom (the "UK,") Bizarre Creations is a video game developer focusing on the racing category with its multi-million unit
selling franchise Project Gotham Racing, a series for the Microsoft Xbox and the Microsoft Xbox360 platforms. Bizarre Creations has also developed and owns the Geometry Wars intellectual property. We
expect that Bizarre Creations will play a role in our growth strategy as we develop intellectual property for the racing genre, expand our development capability and capacity for other genres and
utilize Bizarre Creations' proprietary development technology.

The
results of operations of Bizarre Creations and the estimated fair market values of the acquired assets and liabilities have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements
since the date of acquisition. Pro forma consolidated statements of operations for this acquisition are not shown, as they would not differ materially from reported results. The acquired finite-lived
intangible assets are being amortized over the estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefits consumed, which for some intangible assets are approximated by using the
straight-line method. Goodwill has been included in the publishing segment of our business and is amortized over 15 years for tax purposes.

DemonWare

On May 11, 2007, we completed our acquisition of DemonWare, Ltd., a provider of network middleware technologies for console and PC games
headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. We expect the acquisition to enable us to gain efficiencies related to online game development and to position us to take advantage of the growth in online gameplay
that is expected to be driven by the next-generation consoles. The acquisition is immaterial to fiscal 2008 earnings per share and cash flow.

RedOctane, Inc.

On June 6, 2006, we completed our acquisition of 100% of RedOctane, Inc. ("RedOctane") for an aggregate accounting purchase price of
$99.9 million, including transaction costs, consisting of $30.9 million in cash and 2,382,077 shares of Activision common stock valued at approximately $30.0 million based upon
prevailing market prices which was issued on the closing date, and $39.0 million payable in Activision common stock within two years of the closing date, which is recorded in accrued expenses
and other liabilities at March 31, 2008 and in other liabilities at March 31, 2007. In addition, in the event the net income of the business over a certain period of time exceeds
specified target levels by
certain amounts, certain former shareholders of RedOctane will be entitled to an additional amount of up to $51.0 million payable in shares of Activision common stock. The contingent
consideration will be recorded as an additional element of the purchase price if those contingencies are achieved. We issued part of the contingent considerations in fiscal 2008 as the contingency was
achieved (see Note 8 for additional information.) Based in Sunnyvale, California, RedOctane is a publisher, developer, and distributor of interactive entertainment software, hardware and
accessories. RedOctane offers its interactive entertainment products in versions that operate on the PS2, Xbox 360, and PC, and its leading software product offering is Guitar Hero. RedOctane
also designs, manufactures, and markets high quality video game peripherals and accessories.

The
results of operations of RedOctane and the estimated fair market values of the acquired assets and liabilities have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements since the
date of acquisition. The acquired, finite-lived intangible assets are being amortized over estimated lives ranging from 0.6 to 1.6 years. Goodwill has been included in the publishing segment of
our business and is non-deductible for tax purposes.

intangible assets were $5.0 million which were included in other current assets.

During
the three years ended March 31, 2008, we separately completed the acquisition of other three privately held interactive software development companies. We accounted for
these acquisitions in accordance with SFAS No. 141, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations, requiring that the purchase method be used to account and
report for all business
combinations. These acquisitions have further enabled us to implement our multi-platform development strategy by bolstering our internal product development capabilities for console systems and
personal computers and strengthening our position in the first-person action, action/adventure, music-based gaming and action sports game categories. A significant portion of the purchase price for
all of these acquisitions was assigned to goodwill as the primary asset that we acquired in each of the transactions was an assembled workforce with proven technical and design talent with a history
of high quality product creation. Pro forma Consolidated Statements of Operations for all of these acquisitions in aggregate are not shown, as they would not differ materially from each year's
reported results.

4. Cash, Cash Equivalents, Short-Term and Long-Term Investments (Continued)

Our
investment portfolio usually consists of government and corporate securities with effective maturities of less than 30 months, except for auction rate securities classified as
long-term investments as of March 31, 2008 that have stated maturities of up to 39 years. The $4.7 million gross unrealized losses on securities
available-for-sale represents 0.3% of total investments and cash and cash equivalents at amortized cost. These unrealized losses consist primarily of individual securities with
unrealized losses of less than 10% of each security's amortized cost. The unrealized loss position of approximately $0.3 million of more than 12 months relates to a mortgage-backed
security with a decline of approximately 6% of amortized cost.

Based
upon our analysis of the impaired securities, which includes consideration of the status of debt servicing, the financial condition of the issuer, and our intent and ability to
hold the securities until they mature or recover their costs, we have concluded that the gross unrealized losses of $4.7 million at March 31, 2008 were temporary in nature. We have the
intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient for a recovery of fair value up to (or beyond) the initial cost of the investment. We expect to realize the full value of
all of these investments upon maturity or sale. However, facts and circumstances may change which could result in a decline in fair value considered to be other-than-temporary
in the future.

The
following table illustrates the gross unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale and the fair value of those securities, aggregated by investment
category as of March 31, 2007. The table also illustrates the length of time that they have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2007 (amounts in thousands):

The
increase from March 31, 2007 to March 31, 2008 in the total unrealized losses is predominantly due to the taxable auction rate notes category and relates primarily to
the recent failed auctions. All of our investments in auction rate securities were classified as long-term investments at March 31, 2008 due to the recent failed auctions and
uncertainties of the timing of liquidation. Our investments in auction rate securities are all backed by higher education student loans.

10. Operations by Reportable Segments and Geographic Area

We operate two business segments: (i) publishing of interactive entertainment software and peripherals and (ii) distribution of interactive
entertainment software and hardware products.

Publishing
refers to the development, marketing, and sale of products directly, by license or through our affiliate label program with certain third-party publishers. In the United
States, we primarily sell our products on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, and game specialty stores. We conduct our international
publishing activities through offices in the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Norway, Australia, Sweden, Canada, South Korea and Japan. Our products are sold internationally on a
direct-to-retail basis and through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements and through our wholly-owned distribution subsidiaries located in the UK, the
Netherlands, and Germany.

Distribution
refers to our operations in the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany that provide logistical and sales services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software,
our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

The
accounting policies of these segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Transactions between segments are eliminated in
consolidation.

and 75% of worldwide publishing net revenues were derived from three franchises. In fiscal 2007, 39% of our consolidated net revenues and 52% of worldwide publishing net revenues were derived from
three franchises. In fiscal 2006, 30% of our consolidated net revenues and 38% of worldwide publishing net revenues were derived from three franchises.

As
of March 31, 2008, our available federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $1.0 million is subject to certain limitations as defined under
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2023. We have various state net operating loss carryforwards totaling $14.4 million
which are not subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and will begin to expire in 2013. We have tax credit carryforwards of $0.8 million and
$24.6 million for federal and state purposes, respectively, which begin to expire in fiscal 2016.

Realization
of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the continued generation of sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of tax credits and loss carryforwards. Although
realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the net carrying value of the deferred tax assets will be realized.

Cumulative
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided approximated $168.1 million at March 31, 2008. Deferred income
taxes on these earnings have not been provided as these amounts are considered to be permanent in duration.

12. Income Taxes (Continued)

We
adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

("FIN 48") an interpretation of SFAS No. 109 on April 1, 2007. Implementation of FIN 48 did not result in a material adjustment to the liability for unrecognized income tax
benefits. At the adoption date of April 1, 2007, we had $65.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $26.2 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. As of
March 31, 2008,
we had approximately $74.2 million in total unrecognized tax benefits of which $30.0 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and
ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (amounts in thousands):-

In
addition, consistent with the provisions of FIN 48, we reclassified $23.5 million of income tax liabilities from current to non-current liabilities because
payment of cash or settlement is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date. These non-current income tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2008.

We
recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of March 31, 2008, we had approximately $609,000 of accrued interest related to
uncertain tax positions. For the year ended March 31, 2008, we recorded $69,000 of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions.

The
tax years 2002 through 2007 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject, including United States of America ("U.S.") and non-U.S.
locations. We are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and the California Franchise Tax Board, and it is reasonably possible that the current portion of our unrecognized tax benefits
will significantly decrease within the next twelve months due to the outcome of these audits.

13. Commitments and Contingencies

Credit Facilities

We have revolving credit facilities with our Centresoft subsidiary located in the UK (the "UK Facility") and our NBG subsidiary located in Germany (the "German
Facility.") The UK Facility provided Centresoft with the ability to borrow up to Great British Pounds ("GBP") 12.0 million ($23.9 million) and GBP 12.0 million
($23.6 million), including issuing letters of credit, on a revolving basis as of March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Furthermore, under the UK Facility, Centresoft provided a GBP
0.6 million ($1.2 million) and a GBP 0.6 million ($1.2 million) guarantee for the benefit of our CD Contact subsidiary as of March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
The UK Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.0% as of March 31, 2008 and 2007, is collateralized by substantially all

of
the assets of the subsidiary and expires in March 2009. The UK Facility also contains various covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios related to, among others,
fixed charges. As of March 31, 2008 and 2007, we were in compliance with these covenants. No borrowings were outstanding against the UK Facility as of March 31, 2008 or 2007. The German
Facility provided for revolving loans up to EUR 0.5 million ($0.8 million) as of March 31, 2008 and EUR 0.5 million ($0.7 million) as of March 31, 2007, bore
interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus 2.5%, is collateralized by certain of the subsidiary's property and equipment and has no expiration date. No borrowings were outstanding against the German
Facility as of March 31, 2008 or 2007.

As
of March 31, 2008 and 2007, we maintained a $10.0 million and $7.5 million irrevocable standby letter of credit, respectively. The standby letter of credit is
required by one of our inventory manufacturers to qualify for payment terms on our inventory purchases. Under the terms of this arrangement, we are required to maintain on deposit with the bank a
compensating balance, restricted as to use, of not less than the sum of the available amount of the letter of credit plus the aggregate amount of any drawings under the letter of credit that have been
honored thereunder but not reimbursed. At March 31, 2008 and 2007, the $10.0 million and $7.5 million deposit is included in short-term investments as restricted cash,
respectively. No borrowings were outstanding as of March 31, 2008 or 2007.

As
of March 31, 2008 and 2007, our publishing subsidiary located in the UK maintained a EUR 7.0 million ($11.0 million) and EUR $4.0 million
($5.3 million) irrevocable standby letter of credit, respectively. The standby letter of credit is required by one of our inventory manufacturers to qualify for payment terms on our inventory
purchases. The standby letter of credit does not require a compensating balance and is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and expires in February 2009. No borrowings
were outstanding as of March 31, 2008 or 2007.

Commitments

In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for non-cancelable operating lease agreements for our
offices, for the development of products, as well as for the rights to intellectual property. Under these agreements, we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor, developer, or intellectual
property holder, based upon contractual arrangements. Typically, the payments to third-party developers are conditioned upon the achievement by the developers of contractually specified development
milestones. These payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders typically are deemed to be advances and are recoupable against future royalties earned by the developer or
intellectual property holder based on the sale of the related game. Additionally, in connection with certain intellectual property rights acquisitions and development agreements, we will commit to
spend specified amounts for marketing support for the related game(s) which is to be developed or in which the intellectual property will be utilized.

Additionally,
we lease certain of our facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. Assuming all contractual provisions are met, the total future

rent expense for the years ended March 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was approximately $18.3 million, $14.8 million, and $14.2 million, respectively.

Compensation Guarantee

In June 2005, we entered into an employment agreement with the President and Chief Executive Officer of Activision Publishing, Inc. containing a guarantee
related to total compensation. The agreement guarantees that in the event that on May 15, 2010 total compensation has not exceeded $20.0 million, we will make a payment for the amount of
the shortfall. The $20.0 million guarantee will be recognized as compensation expense over the term of the employment agreement comprising of salary payments, bonus payments, restricted stock
expense, stock option expense, and an accrual for any anticipated remaining portion of the guarantee. The remaining portion of the guarantee is accrued over the term of the agreement in "Other
liabilities" and will remain accrued until the end of the employment agreement at which point it will be used to make a payment for any shortfall or reclassified into shareholders' equity.

Legal Proceedings

On February 8, 2008, the Wayne County Employees' Retirement System filed a lawsuit challenging the transactions contemplated by the business combination
agreement, dated as of December 1, 2007, among us, a wholly owned subsidiary of ours established in connection with the proposed transaction, Vivendi, S.A., Vivendi Games, Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Vivendi, S.A., and VGAC, a wholly

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

owned
subsidiary of Vivendi, S.A., and the sole stockholder of Vivendi Games, Inc. The suit is a putative class action filed against the parties to that business combination agreement as
well as certain members of our Board of Directors. The plaintiff alleges, among other things, that our directors named therein failed to fulfill their fiduciary duties with regard to the transactions
by "surrendering" the negotiating process to "conflicted management," that those breaches were aided and abetted by Vivendi, S.A., and those of its subsidiaries named in the complaint, and that
a preliminary proxy statement contains certain statements that the plaintiff alleges are false and misleading. The plaintiff seeks an order from the court that, among other things, certifies the case
as a class action, enjoins the transaction, requires the defendants to disclose all material information, declares that the transaction is in breach of the directors' fiduciary duties and therefore
unlawful and unenforceable, awards the plaintiff and the putative class damages for all profits and special benefits obtained by the defendant in connection with the transaction and tender offer, and
awards the plaintiff its cost and expense, including attorney's fees.

In
a ruling on March 12, 2008, the court initially declined to schedule a preliminary injunction hearing or allow broad discovery, pending the Company's filing of a revised
preliminary proxy statement in connection with the proposed transactions. The court did order the parties to initiate discovery of core documents, and the Company made an initial production of
documents. On March 7, 2008, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, the grounds for which were detailed in a brief filed on April 30, 2008. On April 30, 2008, the
Company also filed a motion to stay discovery in the case pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss. Separately, on March 6, 2008, Vivendi, S.A., and those of its subsidiaries named in
the complaint filed a motion to dismiss the sole claim alleged against them.

On
May 8, 2008, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint that, among other things, added allegations relating to a revised preliminary proxy statement filed by the Company on
April 30, 2008. That same date, the plaintiff also renewed its motion for expedited proceedings. On May 13, 2008, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On May 14,
2008, Vivendi and its subsidiaries named in the amended complaint also moved to dismiss. On May 22, 2008, the court scheduled a combined hearing for June 30, 2008 on the plaintiff's
motion for a preliminary injunction and the defendants' motions to dismiss, but withheld a ruling on the plaintiff's motion for expedited discovery, pending further briefing. On May 28, 2008,
the court ordered that expedited discovery proceed as to certain claims and that final briefing on the motions to be heard on June 30, 2008 be filed with the court on June 27, 2008. The
Company intends to defend itself vigorously, and no amounts have been recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2008.

In
July 2006, individuals and/or entities claiming to be our stockholders filed derivative lawsuits, purportedly on our behalf, against certain current and former members of our Board of
Directors as well as several of our current and former officers. Three derivative actions have been filed in Los Angeles Superior Court: Vazquez v. Kotick, et al ., L.A.S.C. Case No. BC355327
(filed July 12, 2006); Greuer v. Kotick, et al. L.A.S.C. Case No. SC090343 (filed July 12, 2006); and Amalgamated Bank v. Baker, et al., L.A.S.C. Case No. BC356454 (filed
August 3, 2006). These actions have been consolidated by the court under the caption In re Activision Shareholder Derivative Litigation, L.A.S.C. Master File No. SC090343 (West, J.).
Four derivative actions have been filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California: Pfeiffer v. Kotick, et al., C.D. Cal. Case No. CV06-4771 MRP

These actions have also been consolidated, under the caption In re Activision, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation, C.D. Cal. Case No. CV06-4771 MRP (JTLx) (Pfaelzer, J.).
The consolidated complaints allege, among other things, purported improprieties in our issuance of stock options. Plaintiffs seek various relief on our behalf, including damages, restitution of
benefits obtained from the alleged misconduct, equitable relief, including an accounting and rescission of option contracts; and various corporate governance reforms. We expect that defense expenses
associated with the matters will be covered by our directors and officers insurance, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable policies.

On
or about December 4, 2007, we, the plaintiffs, and certain of our current and former officers and directors notified the court in the federal action that we had reached
agreement in principle to settle the shareholder derivative litigation pending against such current and former directors and officers of ours. On January 17, 2008, the parties amended that
agreement to, among other things, include the plaintiffs in the state court action as parties thereto. The nonbinding agreement in principle was subject, among other things, to the negotiation of a
binding definitive settlement agreement addressing all settlement terms, as well as to further approval by the parties and the court.

Effective
as of May 8, 2008, the parties signed a Stipulation of Settlement with respect to these matters. In entering into the Stipulation of Settlement, neither we nor any of
the settling parties has admitted to any liability or wrongdoing. Under the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement, which is subject to court approval, we will adopt, implement and/or maintain certain
corporate governance and internal control measures, relating principally to the following: board composition, structure and practices, director independence standards, stock ownership and
compensation, and education; shareholder proposal evaluation process; nomination procedures for shareholder-nominated directors; shareholder meeting procedures; executive compensation policies and
procedures; insider trading controls; and stock option granting procedures. We have agreed to keep these measures in place for a period of three years, subject to certain exceptions. The Stipulation
of Settlement also addresses matters relating to the agreements by certain of our current and former directors and officers to reimburse the Company in connection with the receipt of options that
required measurement date corrections. In the case of options already exercised, the agreements allowed reimbursement to be made either by cancellation of vested but unexercised options with a value
equivalent to the additional exercise price or by payment of additional exercise price. In the case of options not yet exercised, the exercise price to be paid upon future exercise of those options is
increased. In the aggregate, settling defendants have elected to
cancel options to acquire approximately 800,000 shares of our common stock and have agreed to increases in the exercise prices of approximately 16.1 million options. The modification of these
options did not result in any incremental compensation expense. In addition, the Stipulation of Settlement provides for us to pay $10,000,000 to plaintiffs' attorneys for their fees and expenses,
subject to court approval of such fees and expenses and subject to our reservation of all rights against our D&O insurance carriers, reinsurers and co-insurers. In anticipation of the
settlement, the Company had recorded a legal expense accrual of approximately $10.0 million as a probable and reasonable estimate in its consolidated financial statements as of March 31,
2008. The Stipulation of Settlement provides that plaintiffs' attorneys will also be entitled to 15% (up to $750,000) of any payment made by our insurance carriers to us in connection with the
settlement. We have not reached agreements with our insurers related to the settlement. The stipulation also provides for the forgiveness of approximately $2.3 million in legal fees previously
billed to us by former outside corporate counsel.

The
Stipulation of Settlement was filed in federal court on May 12, 2008 and was preliminarily approved by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California by order
dated May 13, 2008 and entered on May 14, 2008. The settlement is subject to final court approval after notice and a hearing at which shareholders will have the opportunity to object,
which is currently scheduled to be held on July 21, 2008. The court will then decide whether to approve the settlement as fair, adequate and in the best interest of our stockholders. While we
believe that the settlement meets these criteria, there can be no guarantee that the settlement will receive the required court approval. If final approval is granted, all claims against all
defendants in the litigation will be dismissed with prejudice, and all claims that were or could have been brought by any derivative plaintiff, and all claims that arise from or relate to the matters
or occurrences that were or could have been alleged in the federal and state derivative actions, will be fully, finally and forever released. The individual settling defendants make no admission of
wrongdoing under the Stipulation of Settlement, and they have denied (and continue to deny) all charges of wrongdoing and liability and each and all of the claims and contentions alleged in the
derivative actions.

On
July 24, 2006, we received a letter of informal inquiry from the SEC requesting certain documents and information relating to our historical stock option grant practices.
Thereafter, in early June 2007, the SEC issued a formal order of non-public investigation, pursuant to which it subpoenaed documents from us related to the investigation, and testimony and documents
from certain current and former directors, officers and employees of ours. The Company has made an offer of settlement to the Staff of the SEC, which the SEC Staff has indicated it is prepared to
recommend to the SEC. The tentative settlement of the SEC's investigation, which would allege violations of various provisions of the Federal securities laws, is subject to agreement on the specific
language of the settlement documents, and then to review and approval by the SEC. There can be no assurance that a final settlement will be approved. In connection with the proposed settlement, the
Company would not be required to pay a monetary penalty. Under the proposed settlement, the Company would settle this matter without admitting or denying the SEC's findings.

In
addition, we are party to other routine claims and suits brought by us and against us in the ordinary course of business, including disputes arising over the ownership of intellectual property
rights, contractual claims, employment laws, regulations and relationships, and collection matters. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such routine
claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

14. Stock-Based Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans

Equity Incentive Plans

On July 30, 2007, our Board of Directors adopted the Activision 2007 Incentive Plan (the "2007 Plan,") subject to shareholder approval, and reserved
15,000,000 shares for issuance thereunder and, on September 27, 2007, the 2007 Plan was approved by our shareholders and became effective.

Upon
the effective date of the 2007 Plan, we ceased to make awards under the following equity incentive plans (collectively, the "Rolled-Up Plans"), although such plans will
remain in effect and continue to govern outstanding awards: (i) Activision, Inc. 1998 Incentive Plan, as amended; (ii) Activision, Inc. 1999 Incentive Plan, as amended;
(iii) Activision, Inc. 2001 Incentive Plan, as amended; (iv) Activision, Inc. 2002 Incentive Plan, as amended; (v) Activision, Inc. 2002 Executive

Incentive
Plan, as amended; (vi) Activision, Inc. 2002 Studio Employee Retention Incentive Plan, as amended; and (vii) Activision, Inc. 2003 Incentive Plan, as amended. The
number of shares available for issuance under the 2007 Plan was increased by an additional 2,685,577 shares of our common stock to reflect the shares reserved for issuance but not subject to
outstanding awards under the Rolled-Up Plans at the time the 2007 Plan became effective. Additionally, the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the 2007 Plan
may be further increased from time to time by: (i) the number of shares relating to awards outstanding under any Rolled-Up Plan that: (a) expire, or are forfeited, terminated
or cancelled, without the issuance of shares; (b) are settled in cash in lieu of shares; or (c) are exchanged, prior to the issuance of shares of our common stock, for awards not
involving our common stock; and (ii) if the exercise price of any option outstanding under any Rolled-Up Plan is, or the tax withholding requirements with respect to any award
outstanding under any Rolled-Up Plan are, satisfied by withholding shares otherwise then deliverable in respect of the award or the actual or constructive transfer to us shares already
owned, the number of shares equal to the withheld or transferred shares. As of March 31, 2008, we had approximately 16.1 million shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance
under the 2007 Plan. Shares issued in connection with awards made under the 2007 Plan are generally issued as new stock issuances.

The
2007 Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, share appreciation rights, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and other performance- or value-based awards structured by the Compensation Committee within parameters set forth in the 2007 Plan,
including custom awards that are denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, shares of our common stock, or factors that may influence
the value of our common stock or that are valued based on our performance or the performance of any of our subsidiaries or business units or other factors designated by the Compensation Committee, as
well as incentive bonuses, for the purpose of providing incentives and rewards for superior performance to the directors, officers, employees of, and consultants to, Activision and its subsidiaries.

While
the Compensation Committee has broad discretion to create equity incentives, our equity-based compensation program currently primarily utilizes a combination of options and
restricted stock units. Such awards generally have time-based vesting schedules, vesting annually over periods of three to five years, or vest in their entirety on an anniversary of date
of grant, subject to possible earlier vesting if certain performance measures are met, and all such awards which are options generally expire ten years from the grant date. Under the terms of the 2007
Plan, the exercise price for options must be equal to or greater than the closing price per share of our common stock on the date the award is granted, as reported on the NASDAQ.

In
February 2008, we discovered that, due to an error, the record date for our September 27, 2007 annual meeting was not in technical compliance with Delaware law or our bylaws,
which require such record date to be not more than sixty (60) nor less than ten days (10) before the date of such meeting. In connection with the business combination (see
Note 20), Vivendi has agreed to re-approve and ratify all actions and proposals approved by our shareholders at such meeting, and to vote against any actions and proposals not
approved by our shareholders at such meeting, by written consent of the shareholders as permitted under our bylaws promptly after the closing of the transaction. If the transaction is not consummated
for any reason, we intend to have such actions and proposals ratified at a special meeting of our shareholders called for such purpose or at our next annual stockholder meeting. We have determined
that options and restricted stock rights granted under the 2007 Plan have

F-35

ACTIVISION, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

14. Stock-Based Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)

met
the definition of a grant date in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), as we have the ability and intent to grant options and restricted stock rights under the Roll-Up Plans in view
of the technical non-compliance described above. Further, we have also established a mutual understanding with the employees as to the terms of these grants. Accordingly, stock-based compensation has
been recorded for these options and restricted stock rights grants.

Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock

We grant restricted stock units and restricted stock (collectively referred to as "restricted stock rights") under the 2007 Plan to employees around the world.
Restricted stock units entitle the holders thereof to receive shares of our common stock at the end of a specified period of time. Restricted stock is issued and outstanding upon grant; however,
restricted stock holders are restricted from selling the shares until they vest. Upon vesting of restricted stock rights, we may withhold shares otherwise deliverable to satisfy tax withholding
requirements. Restricted stock rights are subject to forfeiture and transfer restrictions. Vesting for restricted stock rights is based upon the holders' continued employment with us. If the vesting
conditions are not met, unvested restricted stock rights will be forfeited.

Non-Plan Employee Stock Options

In connection with prior employment agreements between the Company and Robert A. Kotick, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian G. Kelly, our
Co-Chairman, Mr. Kotick and Mr. Kelly were granted options to purchase our common stock. The Board of Directors approved the granting of these options. As of March 31,
2008, options to purchase approximately 8,304,800 shares under such grants were outstanding with a weighted-average exercise price of $2.05.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Effective October 1, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the Activision, Inc. Third Amended and Restated 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the
Activision, Inc. Second Amended and Restated 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for International Employees (together, the "ESPP"). Under the ESPP, up to an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of our
common stock may be purchased by

F-36

ACTIVISION, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

14. Stock-Based Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)

eligible
employees during two six-month offering periods that commence each April 1 and October 1 (the "Offering Period"). Common stock is purchased by the ESPP participants
at a price per share generally equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on the first day of the Offering Period and the fair market value of our common stock on the
purchase date (the last day of the Offering Period). Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an Offering Period and are limited to a maximum
of $10,000 in value for any two purchases within the same calendar year. On June 13, 2007, employees purchased 228,242 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $12.835 per share. On
September 28, 2007, employees purchased 126,008 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $16.099 per share. On March 31, 2008, the most recent purchase date employees purchased
208,311 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $18.862. As of March 31, 2008, we had approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under
the ESPP. Shares issued in connection with purchases made under the ESPP are generally issued as new stock issuances.

Non-Employee Warrants

In prior years, we have granted stock warrants to third parties in connection with the development of software and the acquisition of licensing rights for
intellectual property. The warrants generally vest upon grant and are exercisable over the term of the warrant. The exercise price of third-party warrants is generally greater than or equal to the
fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant. No third-party warrants were granted during the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007. As of March 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, third-party warrants to purchase 919,800 and 936,000 shares of our common stock were outstanding with a weighted-average exercise price of $4.59 and $4.54 per share, respectively.

In
accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 96-18,

Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are
Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in conjunction with Selling Goods or Services

, we measure the fair value of the securities on the measurement date. The fair
value of each warrant is capitalized and amortized to expense when the related product is released and the related revenue is recognized. Additionally, as more fully described in Note 1, the
recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses is evaluated on a quarterly basis with amounts determined as not recoverable being charged to expense. In
connection with the evaluation of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses, any capitalized amounts for related third-party warrants are additionally reviewed for
recoverability with amounts determined as not recoverable being amortized to expense. As of March 31, 2006, capitalized amounts of third-party warrants were fully amortized.

Employee Retirement Plan

We have a retirement plan covering substantially all of our eligible employees. The retirement plan is qualified in accordance with Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan, employees may defer up to 92% of their pre-tax salary, up to the maximum amount allowed by law. We contribute an amount equal to 20% of each dollar
contributed by a participant. Our matching contributions to the plan were approximately $1.8 million, $1.5 million, and $1.3 million for the years ended March 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively.

cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $48.0 million, $19.0 million, and $45.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively. Income tax benefit from stock option exercises was $57.3 million, $11.3 million, and $29.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, we present excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, if any, as financing cash flows rather than operating cash flows.

Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we applied SFAS No. 123, amended by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure

("SFAS No. 148"), which allowed companies to apply the existing accounting rules under APB No. 25 and related
Interpretations. According to APB No. 25, a non-cash stock-based compensation expense is recognized for any options granted where the exercise price is lower than the market price
on the actual date of grant. This expense is then amortized over the vesting period of the associated option. As required by SFAS No. 148, prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we
provided pro forma net income and pro forma

stock-based compensation during the year ended March 31, 2006 (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):

In
the table above, stock-based compensation has been tax effected using our effective tax rate which differs from our statutory rate. Additionally, included in fiscal 2006 net income,
as reported, is $467,000 of amortization of unearned compensation related to restricted stock.

As
of April 1, 2005, the Company began estimating the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial-lattice model. Prior to April 1, 2005 the value
of each employee stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model for the purpose of the pro forma financial information in accordance with SFAS No. 123.

Our
employee stock options have features that differentiate them from exchange-traded options. These features include lack of transferability, early exercise, vesting restrictions,
pre- and post-vesting termination provisions, blackout dates, and time-varying inputs. In addition, some of the options have non-traditional features,
such as accelerated vesting upon the satisfaction of certain performance conditions that must be reflected in the valuation. A binomial-lattice model was selected because it is better able to
explicitly address these features than closed-form models such as the Black-Scholes model, and is able to reflect expected future changes in model inputs, including changes in volatility,
during the option's contractual term.

Consistent
with SFAS No. 123R, we have attempted to reflect expected future changes in model inputs during the option's contractual term. The inputs required by our
binomial-lattice model include expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, risk-adjusted stock return, dividend yield, contractual term, and vesting schedule, as well as
measures of employees' forfeiture, exercise, and post-vesting

termination
behavior. Statistical methods were used to estimate employee rank- specific termination rates. These termination rates, in turn, were used to model the number of options that
are expected to vest and post-vesting termination behavior. Employee rank-specific estimates of Expected Time-To-Exercise ("ETTE") were used to reflect
employee exercise behavior. ETTE was estimated by using statistical procedures to first estimate the conditional probability of exercise occurring during each time period, conditional on the option
surviving to that time period and then using those probabilities to estimate ETTE. The model was calibrated by adjusting parameters controlling exercise and post-vesting termination
behavior so that the measures output by the model matched values of these measures that were estimated from historical data. The weighted-average estimated value of employee stock options granted
during the years ended March 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $9.21, $5.86, and $5.09 per share, respectively, using the binomial-lattice model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

To
estimate volatility for the binomial-lattice model, we use methods or capabilities that are discussed in SFAS No. 123R and SAB No. 107. These methods include the implied
volatility method based upon the volatilities for exchange-traded options on our stock to estimate short-term volatility, the historical method (annualized standard deviation of the
instantaneous returns on Activision's stock) during the option's contractual term to estimate long-term volatility and a statistical model to estimate the transition or "mean reversion"
from short-term volatility to long-term volatility. Based on these methods, for options granted during the year ended March 31, 2008, the expected stock price volatility
ranged from 34% to 53%, with a weighted-average volatility of 51%. For options granted during the year ended March 31, 2007, the expected stock price volatility ranged from 38% to 56%, with a
weighted average volatility of 54%. For options granted during the year ended March 31, 2006, the expected stock price volatility ranged from 40% to 55%, with a weighted average volatility of
48%.

As
is the case for volatility, the risk-free rate is assumed to change during the option's contractual term. Consistent with the calculation required by a binomial lattice
model, the risk-free rate reflects the interest from one time period to the next ("forward rate") as opposed to the interest rate from the grant date to the given time period ("spot
rate.") Since we do not currently pay dividends and are not expected to pay them in the future, we have assumed that the dividend yield is zero.

The
expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is, as required by SFAS No. 123R, an
output by the binomial-lattice model. The expected life of employee stock options depends on all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. A binomial-lattice model can be viewed as
assuming that employees will exercise their options when the stock price equals or exceeds an exercise boundary. The exercise boundary is not constant but continually declines as one approaches the
option's expiration

F-40

date.
The exact placement of the exercise boundary depends on all of the model inputs as well as the measures that are used to calibrate the model to estimated measures of employees' exercise and
termination behavior.

As
stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended March 31, 2008 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has
been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS No. 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience.

Accuracy of Fair Value Estimates

We developed the assumptions used in the binomial-lattice model, including model inputs and measures of employees' exercise and post-vesting
termination behavior. Our ability to accurately estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards as of the grant date depends upon the accuracy of the model and our ability to accurately forecast
model inputs as long as ten years into the future. These inputs include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility, risk-free rate, dividend yield, and employee termination
rates. Although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with SFAS No. 123R and SAB No. 107 using an option-pricing model, the estimates that are produced by
this model may not be indicative of the fair value observed between a willing buyer/willing seller. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine if this is the case, because markets do not currently
exist that permit the active trading of employee stock option and other share-based instruments.

period and the exercise price, times the number of shares for options where the exercise price is below the closing stock price) that would have been received by the option holders had all option
holders exercised their options on that
date. This amount changes based on the fair market value of our stock. Total intrinsic value of options actually exercised was $165.4 million, $32.0 million, and $77.9 million for
the years ended March 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

As
of March 31, 2008, $70.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.59 years.

14. Stock-Based Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)

On June 8, 2007, consistent with Internal Revenue Service guidance, the Company commenced an offer to amend the exercise price of unexercised options
subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code held by employees who were not executive officers, in order to eliminate those employees' Section 409A tax liability. Pursuant to the
offer, which closed on July 6, 2007, we made a cash payment in January 2008 to the employees who accepted the offer, totaling approximately $4.1 million, which represents the difference
between the original exercise price of each amended option and the amended exercise price of each amended option. The offer with respect to all eligible options is considered a modification of those
options for financial reporting purposes. Pursuant to the accounting standards in effect under SFAS No. 123R, the incremental fair value of approximately $1.0 million and the remaining
portion of approximately $3.1 million, created as a result of the cash payment that become payable pursuant to the terms of the offer, were recognized as compensation expense and equity,
respectively, at the expiration of the offer period on July 6, 2007.

15. Capital Transactions

Buyback Program

During fiscal 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a buyback program under which we can repurchase up to $350.0 million of our common stock. Under the
program, shares may be purchased as determined by management, from time to time and within certain guidelines, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including privately
negotiated structured stock repurchase transactions and through transactions in the options markets. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at
any time or from time to time without prior notice.

Under
the buyback program, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the years ended March 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. As of March 31, 2008, we had approximately
$226.2 million available for utilization under the buyback program and no outstanding stock repurchase transactions.

Shareholders' Rights Plan

On April 18, 2000, our Board of Directors approved a shareholders rights plan (the "Rights Plan.") Under the Rights Plan, each common shareholder at the
close of business on April 19, 2000, received a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held. Each right represents the right to purchase one-six hundredths
(


/


) of a share, as adjusted on account of stock dividends made since the plan's adoption, of our Series A Junior Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $6.67 per share, as
adjusted on account of stock dividends made since the plan's adoption. Initially, the rights are
represented by our common stock certificates and are neither exercisable nor traded separately from our common stock. The rights will only become exercisable if a person or group acquires 15% or more
of the common stock of Activision, or announces or commences a tender or exchange offer which would result in the bidder's beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock.

In
the event that any person or group acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock each holder of a right (other than such person or members of such group) will thereafter have
the right to receive upon exercise of such right, in lieu of shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock, the number of shares of common stock of Activision having a value equal to two times the
then current exercise price of the right. If we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person has acquired 15% or more of our common stock, each holder of a right
will thereafter have the

F-42

ACTIVISION, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

15. Capital Transactions (Continued)

right
to receive upon exercise of such right a number of the acquiring company's common shares having a market value equal to two times the then current exercise price of the right. For persons who,
as of the close of business on April 18, 2000, beneficially own 15% or more of the common stock of Activision, the Rights Plan "grandfathers" their current level of ownership, so long as they
do not purchase additional shares in excess of certain limitations.

We
may redeem the rights for $.01 per right at any time until the first public announcement of the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 15% of our common stock. At any time after a
person has acquired 15% or more (but before any person has acquired more than 50%) of our common stock, we may exchange all or part of the rights for shares of common stock at an exchange ratio of one
share of common stock per right. The rights expire on April 18, 2010.

We
have amended the Rights Plan concurrent with the execution of the business combination agreement with Vivendi (see Note 20) to provide that (a) the Rights Plan will not
be triggered by the business combination agreement or the transaction and (b) the Rights Plan will terminate upon the completion of the transaction and all rights existing under the Rights Plan
will be extinguished.

19. Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

("SFAS No. 141(R).")
SFAS No. 141(R) provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. It requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction, establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and
requires the acquirer to disclose the nature and financial effect of the business combination. Also in December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160.

Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements

("SFAS No. 160.") SFAS No. 160 Statement amends Accounting
Research Bulletin No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements,

to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling
interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 are required to be adopted simultaneously and are effective for the first annual
reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 with earlier adoption being prohibited. We do not currently have any non-controlling interests in our subsidiaries, and
accordingly the adoption of SFAS No. 160 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact from the adoption of SFAS No. 141R
on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157 ("SFAS No. 157,")

Fair Value Measurements.

SFAS No. 157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to other
accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007 for financial assets and liabilities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for non-financial assets and liabilities. The
adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

("SFAS No. 159.") SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items
at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in
earnings. The provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 is not
expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In
June 2007, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force's ("EITF") consensus conclusion on EITF 07-03,

Accounting for Advance Payments
for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development.

EITF 07-03 addresses the diversity which exists with respect to the accounting for the
non-refundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities. Under this conclusion, an entity is required to defer and
capitalize non-refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
EITF 07-03 is effective for interim or annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 and requires prospective application for new contracts
entered into after the effective date. The adoption of EITF 07-03 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 133

("SFAS No. 161") SFAS No. 161 changes

F-45

ACTIVISION, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

19. Recently Issued Accounting Standards (Continued)

the
disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments,
(b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement No. 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related
hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The guidance in SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim
periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. SFAS No. 161 encourages, but does not require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial
adoption. We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 161.

20. Business Combination Agreement with Vivendi

On December 2, 2007, we and Vivendi S.A. ("Vivendi") (Euronext Paris: VIV) announced the signing of a definitive agreement to combine Vivendi
Games, Inc. ("Vivendi Games,") Vivendi's interactive entertainment business—which includes Blizzard Entertainment, Inc., the creator of

World of
Warcraft

, a massively multi-player online role-playing game franchise—with us. If the transaction closes, we will be renamed Activision
Blizzard, Inc. ("Activision Blizzard"), and we expect to continue to operate as a public company traded on NASDAQ under the ticker ATVI. While we will be the legal acquirer and the surviving
entity in this transaction, Vivendi Games will be deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction treated as a reverse acquisition for accounting purposes. As such, our historical financial
statements after the close of the
merger will be those of Vivendi Games. As Activision will be the deemed accounting acquiree, we are charging to expenses all costs related to the merger as incurred.

Under
the term of the business combination agreement, we and Vivendi Games will combine our businesses through the merger of a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of ours with and into
Vivendi Games. As a result of the merger, Vivendi Games, the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. and Sierra Entertainment, Inc., will become a wholly owned subsidiary of ours.
VGAC LLC, a subsidiary of Vivendi and the sole stockholder of Vivendi Games, will receive approximately 295.3 million newly issued shares of our common stock in the merger, which number
is based upon a valuation of Vivendi Games at $8.121 billion and a per share price for our common stock of $27.50.

Simultaneously
with the merger, Vivendi will purchase from us 62.9 million newly issued shares of our common stock, at $27.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $1.731 billion. Immediately following completion of the merger and share purchase, Vivendi and its subsidiaries are expected to own approximately 52.2% of the issued and
outstanding shares of Activision Blizzard's common stock on a fully diluted basis.

After
the closing of the transaction, Activision Blizzard will commence a cash tender offer for up to 146.5 million of its shares (representing approximately 50% of the shares of
our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the transaction) at $27.50 per share. If the tender offer is fully subscribed, Vivendi and its subsidiaries are expected to own approximately 68.0% of
the issued and outstanding shares of Activision Blizzard's common stock on a fully diluted basis. Under the terms of the business combination agreement, we and Vivendi have agreed the purchase of the
shares tendered in the tender offer will be funded as follows: (a) the first $2.928 billion of the aggregate consideration will be funded by Activision Blizzard with proceeds from the
share purchase described above, available cash on hand and, if necessary, borrowings made under one or more new credit facilities; (b) if the

F-46

ACTIVISION, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

20. Business Combination Agreement with Vivendi (Continued)

aggregate
consideration is more than $2.928 billion, Vivendi has agreed to purchase from Activision Blizzard, at a purchase price of $27.50 per share, additional newly issued shares of
Activision Blizzard common stock in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) $700 million and (y) the excess of the aggregate consideration over $2.928 billion, which amount
will be used to fund the amount of the aggregate consideration that is in excess of $2.928 billion; and (c) if the aggregate consideration exceeds $3.628 billion, Activision
Blizzard will fund the additional amount of the aggregate consideration that is in excess of $3.628 billion (up to the maximum aggregate consideration of $4.028 billion) through
borrowings made under the new credit facilities issued by Vivendi (see Note 21).

All
information included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report reflects only our results, and does not
reflect any impact of the proposed merger.

21. Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement with Vivendi

On April 29, 2008, we entered into a senior unsecured credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Vivendi. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement cannot
be effected until the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement ("BCA") described in Note 20 above (the "Transactions.") As previously disclosed, after
the closing of the Transactions, among other things, the Company's name will be changed to Activision Blizzard.

After
the closing of the Transactions, the Credit Agreement will provide Activision Blizzard with (i) a term loan credit facility (the "Tranche A Facility") in an aggregate
amount of up to $400.0 million to be applied to fund that portion of the post-closing tender offer consideration in excess of $3.628 billion as set forth in the BCA,
(ii) a term loan credit facility (the "Tranche B Facility") in an aggregate amount of up to $150.0 million to be applied to repay certain indebtedness of Vivendi Games after the
closing in accordance with the terms of the BCA, and (iii) a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility," and collectively with the Tranche A Facility and the Tranche B
Facility, the "New Credit Facilities") in an aggregate amount of up to $475.0 million to be used after the closing of the Transactions for general corporate purposes. In the event the BCA
terminates prior to the closing of the Transactions, the New Credit Facilities will terminate effective on the same date.

Subject
to execution of customary closing documentation, the Tranche A Facility will be funded after the end of the tender offer period, in a single borrowing that is limited to
the amount, if any, of the aggregate consideration to be paid in respect of the post-closing tender offer in excess of $3.628 billion. The Tranche B Facility will be funded
after the consummation of the Transactions. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility will be subject to the foregoing conditions and other customary conditions, such as the truth of representations and
warranties and the absence of default.

Borrowings
under each of the New Credit Facilities will bear interest by reference to the "LIBOR" (and under limited circumstances, at Vivendi's election, a "Base Rate.") The applicable
margin with respect to loans bearing interest with reference to the LIBOR will be (i) 0.85% per annum for loans under the Tranche A Facility and (ii) 1.20% per annum for loans
under the Tranche B Facility and the Revolving Facility, respectively. The applicable margin with respect to loans bearing interest with reference to the Base Rate, if any, will be 1.0% lower
than the margin applicable to LIBOR borrowings.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

21. Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement with Vivendi (Continued)

Any
unused amounts under the Revolving Facility will be subject to a commitment fee of 0.42% per annum accruing from and after the closing of the Transactions.

The
Tranche A Facility is payable in full on March 31, 2010. The Tranche B Facility and the Revolving Facility will terminate and be payable in full on
March 31, 2011.

The
loans under each of the New Credit Facilities may be prepaid in full or in part at any time, without premium or penalty (subject to customary breakage costs for loans bearing
interest by reference to LIBOR), at Activision Blizzard's option.

The
loans under each of the New Credit Facilities are subject to mandatory prepayment in an amount of 100% of the proceeds from (i) asset sales in excess of $30.0 million
in the aggregate (subject to customary reinvestment rights) and (ii) issuance of equity (subject to exceptions for issuance of stock to employees and issuances of the proceeds used to fund
permitted acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures).

The
New Credit Facilities are subject to customary negative covenants, in each case subject to certain exceptions, qualifications and baskets, including limitations on: indebtedness;
liens; investments, mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; transactions with affiliates; issuance of preferred stock by subsidiaries; sale and leaseback transactions, restricted payments and
certain restrictions with respect to subsidiaries. The limitation on indebtedness provides that Activision Blizzard and its subsidiaries cannot incur consolidated indebtedness, net of unrestricted
cash, in excess of $1.5 billion, and that no additional indebtedness may be incurred as long as the ratio of Activision Blizzard's consolidated indebtedness (including the indebtedness to be
incurred) minus the amount of unrestricted cash to Activision Blizzard's consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its most recently ended four quarters would be
greater than 1.50 to 1.0. This limitation does not, however, affect Activision Blizzard's ability to borrow under the New Credit Facilities or to incur certain types of limited debt.

The
New Credit Facilities also impose a requirement on Activision Blizzard that the ratio of (i) consolidated indebtedness (net of certain cash) to (ii) the sum of its
shareholder's equity plus consolidated indebtedness (net of certain cash) not exceed 20.0% at any time.

Events
of default under the New Credit Facilities include nonpayment, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, cross-defaults, bankruptcy or insolvency events, and failures
to satisfy material judgments, in most events subject to materiality levels, grace periods and other customary exceptions.
