operatives, membership stores and wholesalers.  Certain food
products,  such  as seafood and some food service  products,

   The  Company's Consumer Foods business segment is  highly
competitive,  with  numerous competitors of  varying  sizes.

quality, advertising, promotion and price.  In most  of  its
consumer  foods lines, General Mills competes not only  with
other  widely  advertised branded products,  but  also  with

service.   Restaurant businesses rely on the varied  tastes,

OLIVE GARDEN  restaurants  are market share leaders  in  the
United States.

GENERAL
   Trademarks  and  Patents.   The  Company's  products  are
marketed  and  businesses  operated  under  trademarks   and
service   marks  owned  by  or  licensed  to  the   Company.
Trademarks  and  service marks are vital  to  the  Company's
business.  The most significant trademarks and service marks
of  the  Company  are  contained  in  the  business  segment
discussions above.

   The  Company considers that, taken as a whole, the rights
under  its various patents, which expire from time to  time,
are  a valuable asset, but the Company does not believe that
its  businesses  are materially dependent  upon  any  single
patent   or   group  of  related  patents.   The   Company's
activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions
are not material.

   Raw Materials and Supplies.   The principal raw materials
used  by  General  Mills are cereal grains,  sugar,  fruits,
other  agricultural products, vegetable oils, fish for  food
products,  and  plastic and paper for  packaging  materials.
Although  General  Mills has some long-term  contracts,  the
bulk of such raw materials are purchased on the open market.
Although prices of most raw materials will probably increase
over  the long term, General Mills believes that it will  be
able  to  obtain  an adequate supply of such raw  materials.
Occasionally and where possible, General Mills makes advance
purchases  of  commodities significant to  its  business  in
order  to  ensure continuity of operations.  In many  cases,
the  Company also seeks to protect itself from basic  market
price  fluctuations  of  certain  commodities  (grains   and
vegetable oil) through hedging transactions.

   Capital  Expenditures.   During the  three  fiscal  years
ended  May  29, 1994, General Mills expended $1,879  million
for capital expenditures, not including the cost of acquired
companies.  The Company expects to spend approximately  $525
million for such purposes in fiscal 1995.

    Research  and  Development.    The  main  research   and
development  facilities are located at the James  Ford  Bell
Technical  Center  in Golden Valley (suburban  Minneapolis),
Minnesota.  With a staff of approximately 740, the Center is
responsible  for most of the food research for the  Company.
Approximately one-half of the staff hold degrees in  various
chemical, biological and engineering sciences.  Research and
development expenditures (all Company-sponsored) amounted to
$63.6  million in fiscal 1994, $60.1 million in fiscal  1993
and  $62.1 million in fiscal 1992.  General Mills'  research
and   development  resources  are  focused  on  new  product
development,   product  improvement,  process   design   and
improvement,  packaging  and  exploratory  research  in  new
business areas.

    Employees.    At  May  29,  1994,  General   Mills   had
approximately 125,700 employees.

   Environmental Matters.   As of June 30, 1994, the Company
has  received  notices  advising it  that  there  have  been
releases  or threatened releases of hazardous substances  or
wastes  at  10  sites,  and alleging  that  the  Company  is
potentially  responsible for cleaning up those sites  and/or
paying certain costs in connection with those sites.   These
matters   involve  several  different  procedural  contexts,
including  litigation initiated by governmental  authorities
and/or private parties, administrative proceedings commenced
by   regulatory  agencies,  and  demand  letters  issued  by
regulatory  agencies  and/or private parties.   The  Company
recognizes that its potential exposure with respect  to  any
of  these  sites may be joint and several, but has concluded
that  its probable aggregate exposure is not material.  This
conclusion is based upon, among other things, the  Company's
payments  and/or  accruals with respect to  each  site;  the
number, ranking, and financial strength of other potentially
responsible  parties identified at each of  the  sites;  the
status  of  the  proceedings, including  various  settlement
agreements, consent decrees or court orders; allocations  of
volumetric  waste contributions and allocations of  relative
responsibility   among   potentially   responsible   parties
developed  by  regulatory agencies and by  private  parties;
remediation   cost   estimates  prepared   by   governmental
authorities  or  private  technical  consultants;  and   the
Company's historical experience in negotiating and  settling
disputes with respect to similar sites.

   Based  on current facts and circumstances, General  Mills
believes  that neither the results of these proceedings  nor
its  compliance  in  general  with  environmental  laws   or
regulations  will  have a material effect upon  the  capital
expenditures,  earnings  or  competitive  position  of   the
Company.

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
    In  management's  opinion,  there  were  no  claims   or
litigation  pending at June 30, 1994, the outcome  of  which
could   have   a  significant  effect  on  the  consolidated
financial   position  of  General  Mills,   Inc.   and   its
subsidiaries.   The  Company  has  received  several   state
consumer  class  action  lawsuits  in  connection  with  the
improper  substitution by an independent  contractor  of  an
unapproved  pesticide to treat some of the Company's  stored
oat  supplies during fiscal 1994.  The Federal Food and Drug
Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency  have
stated  that there is no health issue associated  with  this
matter.  The Company believes the cases to be without merit,
and  any cost to the Company is not expected to be material.

"Environmental   Matters,"  supra,  for  a   discussion   of

    For purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, 
earnings represent pretax income from continuing operations plus fixed 
charges (net of capitalized interest).  Fixed charges represent interest  
(whether expensed or capitalized) and one-third (the proportion deemed
representative of the interest factor) of rents of continuing operations.
