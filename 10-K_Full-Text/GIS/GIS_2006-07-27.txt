ventures.

Domestic Joint Venture

We have a 50 percent equity interest
in 8th Continent, LLC, a joint venture formed with DuPont to develop and market soy-based products. This venture began marketing
a line of

8th Continent

soymilk in July 2001.

International Joint Ventures

We have a 50 percent equity interest
in Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), a joint venture with Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé) that manufactures and markets
ready-to-eat cereal products in more than 130 countries and republics outside the United States and Canada. The cereal products
marketed by CPW under the umbrella

Nestlé

trademark in fiscal 2006 include:

Chocapic, Cini Minis, Cookie Crisp

,
Corn Flakes,

Crunch, Fitness, Fitness and Fruit, Honey Nut Cheerios, Cheerios, Nesquik, Shredded Wheat

and

Shreddies.

CPW also markets cereal bars in several European countries and manufactures private label cereals for customers in the United
Kingdom. On July 14, 2006, CPW acquired the Uncle Tobys cereal business in Australia for approximately $385 million. This
business had revenues of approximately $100 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. We funded our 50 percent
share of the purchase price by making an additional equity contribution in CPW from cash generated from our international operations,
including our international joint ventures.

We have 50 percent equity interests in the following joint ventures for the
manufacture, distribution and marketing of

Häagen-Dazs

frozen ice cream products and novelties: Häagen-Dazs
Japan K.K., Häagen-Dazs Korea Company Limited and Häagen-Dazs Marketing & Distribution (Philippines) Inc. We
have a 49 percent equity interest in Häagen-Dazs Distributors (Thailand) Company Limited. We also have a 50 percent equity
interest in Seretram, a joint venture with Co-op de Pau for the production of

Green Giant

canned corn in France.

In May 2006, we acquired a controlling financial interest in our Häagen-Dazs
joint venture in the Philippines for less than $1 million.

COMPETITION

The consumer foods market is highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the
United States and throughout the world. The food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors
in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. We also compete with private label products
offered by supermarkets, mass merchants and other retailers such as club stores. Competition in our product categories is based
on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity
and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments
include superior product quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovation and price. In most product
categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with generic



and private label products, which are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we compete with both multi-national and
local manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors.

CUSTOMERS

During fiscal 2006, one customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Wal-Mart), accounted for approximately 18
percent of our consolidated net sales and 24 percent of our sales in the U.S. Retail segment. No other customer accounted for
10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. At May 28, 2006, Wal-Mart accounted for 17 percent of our trade receivables
invoiced in the U.S. Retail segment. The top five customers in our U.S. Retail segment accounted for approximately 47 percent
of its fiscal 2006 net sales, and the top five customers in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment accounted for approximately
36 percent of its fiscal 2006 net sales.

SEASONALITY

In general, demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year. However, within our U.S.
Retail segment demand for refrigerated dough, frozen baked goods and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter.
Demand for

Progresso

soup and

Green Giant

canned and frozen vegetables is higher during the fall and winter months.

Internationally, demand for

Häagen-Dazs

ice cream is higher during
the summer months and demand for baking mix and dough products increases during winter months. Due to the offsetting impact
of these demand trends, as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres, our international net sales
are generally evenly balanced throughout the year.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

Trademarks and service marks are vital to our businesses. Our products are marketed under trademarks
and service marks that are owned by or licensed to us. The most significant trademarks and service marks used in our businesses
are set forth in

italics

in this report. These marks include the trademarks used in our international joint ventures
that are owned by or licensed to the joint ventures. In addition, some of our products are marketed under or in combination
with trademarks that have been licensed from others, including

Reese’s Puffs

cereal,

Hershey’s

chocolate
included with a variety of products,

Dora the Explorer

for yogurt and cereal, and a variety of characters and brands
used on fruit snacks, including

Sunkist, My Little Pony

,

Animal Planet

,

Care Bears

and various Warner
Bros. characters. We use the

Yoplait

trademark in connection with our yogurt business in the United States under the
terms of a license agreement with a third party licensor. U.S. trademark and service mark registrations are generally for a
term of 10 years, renewable every 10 years as long as the trademark is used in the regular course of trade.

We own the

Häagen-Dazs

trademark and have the right to use the
trademark outside of the United States and Canada. We use the trademark internationally through Company-owned
operations, a franchise system and joint ventures in the Asia/Pacific region. Nestlé has an exclusive royalty-free license
to use the trademark in the United States and Canada.

J. M. Smucker Company (Smucker) holds an exclusive royalty-free license to
use the

Doughboy

trademark and

Pillsbury

brand in the dessert mix and baking mix categories. The license is renewable
without cost in 20-year increments at Smucker’s discretion.

Given our focus on developing and marketing innovative, proprietary products,
we consider the collective rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset, but we do not
believe that our businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.

BACKLOG

Orders are generally filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time
prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders at May 28, 2006, was not material.

RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES

The principal raw materials that we use are cereal grains, sugar, dairy products, vegetables, fruits,
meats, vegetable oils, and other agricultural products as well as paper and plastic packaging materials, operating supplies
and energy. We have some long-term fixed price contracts, but the majority of our raw materials are purchased on the open market.
We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed ingredients and packaging materials. Occasionally and
where possible, we make advance purchases of items significant to our business in order to ensure continuity of operations.
Our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production needs at price levels that allow
a targeted profit margin. Since commodities generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our products, to
the extent possible, we hedge the risk associated with adverse price movements using exchange-traded futures and options, forward
cash contracts and over-the-counter derivatives. See also Note Six to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages
40 through 42 in Item Eight of this report and Item Seven A on page 27 of this report.



CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

During the fiscal year ended May 28, 2006, our aggregate capital expenditures for land, buildings
and equipment were $360 million. We expect to spend approximately $425 million for capital projects in fiscal 2007, primarily
for fixed assets to support further growth and increase supply chain productivity.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Major research and development facilities are located at the Riverside Technical Center in Minneapolis,
Minnesota and the James Ford Bell Technical Center in Golden Valley (suburban Minneapolis), Minnesota. Our research and development
resources are focused on new product development, product improvement, process design and improvement, packaging and exploratory
research in new business areas. Research and development expenditures amounted to $173 million in fiscal 2006, $168 million
in fiscal 2005 and $158 million in fiscal 2004.

EMPLOYEES

At May 28, 2006, we had approximately 28,100 full- and part-time employees.

FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETY REGULATION

The manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated. In the United States, our
activities are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Department
of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Commerce and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state
and local agencies. Our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the United States.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

As of July 27, 2006, we were involved with the following active cleanup sites associated
with the alleged release or threatened release of hazardous substances or wastes:

Site

Chemical of Concern

Central Steel Drum,

Newark, New Jersey

No single hazardous material specified

East Hennepin,

Minneapolis, Minnesota

Trichloroethylene

Vallejo, California

Petroleum fuel products

King’s Road Landfill,

Toledo, Ohio

No single hazardous material specified

Kipp, Kansas

Carbon tetrachloride

Northside Sanitary Landfill,

Zionsville, Indiana

No single hazardous material specified

Operating Industries,

Los Angeles, California

No single hazardous material specified

Sauget Landfill,

Sauget, Illinois

No single hazardous material specified

Safer Textiles,

Moonachie, New Jersey

Tetrachloroethylene

Stuckey’s,

Doolittle, Missouri

Petroleum fuel products

These matters involve several different actions, including administrative
proceedings commenced by regulatory agencies and demand letters by regulatory agencies and private parties.

We recognize that our potential exposure with respect to any of these sites
may be joint and several, but have concluded that our probable aggregate exposure is not material. This conclusion is based
upon, among other things: our payments and accruals with respect to each site; the number, ranking and financial strength of
other potentially responsible parties identified at each of the sites; the status of the proceedings, including various settlement
agreements, consent decrees or court orders; allocations of volumetric waste contributions and allocations of relative responsibility
among potentially responsible parties developed by regulatory agencies and by private parties; remediation cost estimates prepared
by governmental authorities or private technical consultants; and our historical experience in negotiating and settling disputes
with respect to similar sites.

Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, and the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, and all similar state environmental laws applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Based on current facts and circumstances, we believe that neither the results
of our environmental proceedings



nor our compliance in general with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE
PURPOSE OF “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

This report contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on our management’s current expectations and assumptions.
We and our representatives also may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements
contained in our filings with the SEC and in our reports to stockholders.

The words or phrases “will likely result,” “are expected to,”
“will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project” or similar
expressions identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from historical results and those currently anticipated or projected. We wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on
any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.

In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause
our actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future
periods in any current statements.

Our future results could be affected by a variety of factors, such as: competitive
dynamics in the consumer foods industry and the markets for our products, including new product introductions, advertising
activities, pricing actions and promotional activities of our competitors; economic conditions, including changes in inflation
rates, interest rates or tax rates; product development and innovation; consumer acceptance of new products and product improvements;
consumer reaction to pricing actions and changes in promotion levels; acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets;
changes in capital structure; changes in laws and regulations, including labeling and advertising regulations; changes in accounting
standards and the impact of significant accounting estimates; product quality and safety issues, including recalls and product
liability; changes in customer demand for our products; effectiveness of advertising, marketing and promotional programs; changes
in consumer behavior, trends and preferences, including weight loss trends; consumer perception of health-related issues, including
obesity; consolidation in the retail environment; changes in purchasing and inventory levels of significant customers; fluctuations
in the cost and availability of supply chain resources, including raw materials, packaging and energy; disruptions or inefficiencies
in the supply chain; benefit plan expenses due to changes in



plan asset values and discount rates used to determine plan liabilities; resolution of uncertain income tax matters; foreign
economic conditions, including currency rate fluctuations; and political unrest in foreign markets and economic uncertainty
due to terrorism or war.

You should also consider the risk factors that we identify on pages 7
through 10 in Item One A of this report, which could also affect our future results.

We undertake no obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statements
to reflect future events or circumstances.

ITEM 1A

RISK FACTORS

Various risks and uncertainties could affect our business. Any of the risks described below or elsewhere
in this report or our other filings with the SEC could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently
known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations in the future. Therefore, the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or
uncertainties.

The food categories in which we participate are very competitive, and
if we are not able to compete effectively, our results of operations would be adversely affected.

The food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these
categories all have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. We also compete with private label products offered
by supermarkets, mass merchants and other retailers such as club stores. Competition in our product categories is based on
product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity
and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our large competitors were to decrease their pricing or were
to increase their promotional spending, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.
If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could
also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands
or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably
superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over private label products.

We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating
retail environment.

Our five largest customers in our U.S. Retail segment together accounted for approximately 47 percent
of that segment’s net sales for fiscal 2006. The loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could adversely
affect our sales and profits. In addition, as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass market retailers become
larger, our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency,
lower pricing and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation
and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted.

Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials
and packaging may adversely affect our profitability.

The raw materials used in our business include cereal grains, sugar, dairy products, vegetables, fruits,
meats, vegetable oils, and other agricultural products as well as paper and plastic packaging materials, operating supplies
and energy. These items are largely commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather
and product scarcity, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs.
Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging and energy costs. If we are unable to
increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices as a result of consumer sensitivity to pricing
or otherwise, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices
and the hedging procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend.

If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could
suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate.

Our future success and earnings growth depends in part on our ability to be efficient in the production
and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets. Our ability to gain additional efficiencies may become more
difficult over time as we take advantage of existing opportunities. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains
or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and also weaken our
competitive position. Further, many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of



manufacturing facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which
may negatively impact product volume and margins.

Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.

Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our
manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes or other reasons
could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or
potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced
from a single location, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources
to restore our supply chain.

We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and
trends, which may result in decreased demand for our products.

Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumers
and to offer products that appeal to their preferences. Consumer preferences change from time to time and can be affected by
a number of different trends. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react to these changes and trends, and to introduce new
and improved products on a timely basis, could result in reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues
and profitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health
effects of ingredients such as trans fats, sugar, processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes.

We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are
in faster growing and more profitable categories.

The food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends
in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve
that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories.
Our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not
succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth may slow, which could adversely affect
our profitability.

Customer demand for our products may be limited in future periods as
a result of increased purchases in response to promotional activity.

Our unit volume in the last week of each quarter is consistently higher than the average for the preceding
weeks of the quarter. In comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks of a quarter, the final week
of each quarter has approximately two to four days’ worth of incremental shipments (based on a five-day week), reflecting
increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter. This increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers
have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter,
as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets. If, due to quarter-end promotions or other reasons,
our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than end-consumer demand will require in future periods, our sales
level in future reporting periods could be adversely affected.

Economic downturns could cause consumers to shift their food purchases
from our higher priced premium products to lower priced items, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

The willingness of consumers to purchase premium branded food products depends in part on local economic
conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands. In those
circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin
offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, we may be unable to raise our prices as a result of
increased consumer sensitivity to pricing. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our international operations are subject to political and economic
risks.

In fiscal 2006, approximately 16 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the
United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could
significantly harm our business. These risks include:

•

political and economic instability;

•

exchange controls and currency exchange rates;

•

foreign tax treaties and policies; and

•

restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries.



Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to
fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could cause our results of operations to vary materially from period
to period. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency
fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.

Concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers
to avoid our products.

We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety
and quality of certain food products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid,
may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.

If our food products become adulterated or misbranded, we might need
to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured.

We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded. We may also be
liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses
due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for
a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product
recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidence
in our food products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.

New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our
business.

Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state, local and foreign
agencies. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing
business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. In addition, we advertise our
products and could be the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising under federal, state and foreign laws
and regulations.

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing
and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.

As of May 28, 2006, we had total debt and minority interests of approximately $7.2 billion. The
agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the
future.

Our level of indebtedness may limit our:

•

ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes,
particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and

•

flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general
economic conditions.

There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and minority interests.
If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness and minority interests (and other unrelated indebtedness) could
become due and payable prior to its stated maturity. A default under our debt instruments and minority interests may also significantly affect our
ability to obtain additional or alternative financing.

If our subsidiary General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) fails to make required
distributions to the holders of the B-1 interests of GMC, we will be restricted from paying any dividends (other than dividends
in the form of shares of common stock) or other distributions on shares of our common stock and may not repurchase or redeem
shares of our common stock until such distributions are paid.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other
obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions
and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.

Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates and other factors
or changes in our employee base could substantially increase our pension and postretirement costs.

We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada and
various foreign locations, including pension, retiree health and welfare, severance and other post-employment plans. Our major
pension plans are funded, with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates,
health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status
of our pension and postretirement plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements
of the plans. Although the aggregate fair value of our pension and postretirement plan assets exceeded the aggregate pension
and postretirement benefit obligations as of May 28, 2006, a significant increase in future funding requirements could
have a negative impact on our results of operations or cash flows from operations.



If other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) are unable to contribute
to remediation costs at certain contaminated sites, our costs for remediation could be material.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws
and regulations. Under certain of these laws, namely the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
and its state counterparts, liability for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or
formerly owned or operated facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites is joint and several. We currently are involved
in active remediation efforts at certain sites where we have been named a PRP. If other PRPs at these sites are unable to contribute
to remediation costs, we could be held responsible for all or their portion of the remediation costs, and those costs could
be material. We cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these environmental matters or compliance with environmental
laws in general will not exceed our reserves or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles
could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.

Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase prices of acquired companies and the related
fair values of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for each
of our reporting units. We compare the carrying amount of goodwill for a reporting unit with its fair value and if the carrying
amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment has occurred.

The costs of patents, copyrights and other intangible assets with finite lives
are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangibles with indefinite lives, principally brands, are carried at cost.
Finite and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when fair value is less than
the carrying amount of the intangible.

Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow
model using inputs from our annual long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth
assumptions and other factors.

As of May 28, 2006, we had $10.3 billion of goodwill and other intangible
assets. Events and conditions that could result in an impairment include changes in the industries in which we operate, including
competition and advances in technology; a significant product liability or intellectual property claim; or other factors leading
to reduction in expected sales or profitability. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, our
consolidated net earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected by a non-cash charge.

Resolution of uncertain income tax matters could adversely affect our
cash flows from operations.

We accrue income tax liabilities for potential assessments related to uncertain tax positions in a
variety of taxing jurisdictions. An unfavorable resolution of these matters, including the accounting for losses recorded as
part of the Pillsbury transaction, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows from operations.

ITEM 7

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

We are a global consumer foods company. We develop differentiated food products and market these value-added
products under unique brand names. We work continuously on product innovation to improve our established brands and to
create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our
brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing and innovative merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy
is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe.

Our businesses are organized into three reportable segments. U.S. Retail reflects
business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, specialty stores and drug, dollar and discount
chains operating throughout the United States. Our major product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals,
meals, refrigerated and frozen dough products, baking products, snacks, yogurt and organic foods. Our International segment
is made up of retail businesses outside of the United States, including a retail business in Canada that largely mirrors our
U.S. Retail product mix, and foodservice businesses outside of the United States and Canada. Our Bakeries and Foodservice segment
consists of products marketed throughout the United States and Canada to retail and wholesale bakeries, commercial and noncommercial
foodservice distributors and operators, restaurants, and convenience stores.

Our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders
over the long term. In the most recent fiscal year, our total return to stockholders, including stock price appreciation and
dividends, was 7.2 percent, while the S&P 500 Index returned 8.8 percent; from fiscal 2001 to 2006, our total return to
stockholders averaged 6.8 percent per year while the S&P 500 Index posted a 1.8 percent average annual return
over the same period.

Our long-term growth objectives are:

•

low single-digit average annual growth in net sales;

•

mid-single-digit average annual growth in total segment operating profit (see page 25 for our discussion of this measure not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)); and

•

high single-digit average annual growth in earnings per share (EPS).



These measures, combined with an attractive dividend yield and improvement
in return on capital, drive the management of our business.

For the fiscal year ended May 28, 2006, our net sales grew 4 percent
and total segment operating profit grew 5 percent, in line with our long-term goals. Diluted EPS decreased 6 percent in fiscal
2006; however, excluding the EPS effects of our convertible debentures in both fiscal years and the fiscal 2005 net
benefit of gains on divestitures and debt repurchase costs, our diluted EPS grew 8 percent, in line with our long-term goal
(see page 24 for our discussion of this measure not defined by GAAP). Our net cash provided by operations increased
to nearly $1.8 billion in 2006, enabling us to: increase our annual dividend payments by 8 percent from fiscal 2005; continue
to return cash to stockholders via share repurchases, which totaled $885 million in fiscal 2006; and repay $189 million of
debt. We continued to reinvest in the long-term growth in our brands, increasing advertising by 8 percent from
fiscal 2005, and we also continued to make significant capital investments to support future growth and productivity, as we
spent $360 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2006. Finally, our return on average total capital improved by 60 basis
points (see page 25 for our discussion of this measure not defined by GAAP).

Results for fiscal 2006 were negatively impacted by increased fuel and commodity
costs and higher advertising spending. Details of our financial results are provided in the “Fiscal 2006 Consolidated
Results of Operations” section below.

As we begin fiscal 2007, we have momentum in several of our key businesses.
We must sustain that momentum and restore net sales growth in two operating units that did not grow in fiscal 2006 – Big
G cereals and Pillsbury USA. We plan to launch new products, achieve competitive levels of retailer merchandising activity
and increase advertising in Big G cereals in fiscal 2007. In Pillsbury USA, we plan to launch new products and focus consumer
marketing support to improve product mix. We expect our worldwide food business to achieve another year of good sales and operating
profit growth. We also intend to deliver more growth from new products and accelerate our performance in fast-growing channels
such as drug stores, dollar stores and club formats. Finally, we plan to expand our margins by focusing on realizing price
increases, managing our input costs, and achieving productivity through supply chain and administrative cost-saving efforts.
We expect our fiscal 2007 interest expense to be $40 million higher than in fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher interest rates.
We also expect the impact of the adoption of a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation to reduce earnings by $0.11
to $0.12 per diluted share in fiscal 2007, and we expect our effective tax rate to increase 75 to 125 basis points over the
fiscal 2006 effective rate of 34.5 percent.

FISCAL 2006 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For fiscal 2006, we reported diluted EPS of $2.90, down 6 percent from $3.08 per share earned
in fiscal 2005. Excluding the effects of our convertible debentures in both fiscal years and excluding the fiscal 2005 net
benefit of gains on divestitures and debt repurchase costs, diluted EPS increased 8 percent from $2.75 in fiscal 2005 to $2.98
in fiscal 2006. Earnings after tax were $1,090 million in fiscal 2006, down 12 percent from $1,240 million in fiscal 2005,
reflecting the net benefit of gains on divestitures and debt repurchase costs in fiscal 2005.

Net sales for fiscal 2006 grew 4 percent to $11.6 billion, driven by 2 percentage
points of unit volume growth, primarily in U.S. Retail and International, and 1 percentage point of growth from pricing and
product mix across many of our businesses. Promotional spending and foreign currency exchange effects were flat compared to
fiscal 2005. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table:

Cost of sales was up $132 million in fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005, primarily
due to unit volume increases, as manufacturing efficiencies largely offset cost increases due to inflation. Also, the year-over-year
change in cost of sales was favorably impacted by the following costs incurred in fiscal 2005: $18 million in expense from
accelerated depreciation associated with exit activities, as described below; and $5 million of product recall costs. Cost
of sales as a percent of net sales decreased from 60.8 percent in fiscal 2005 to 59.9 percent in fiscal 2006.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased by $260 million
in fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005. SG&A as a percent of net sales increased from 21.5 percent in fiscal 2005 to 23.0 percent
in fiscal 2006. The increase in SG&A from fiscal 2005 was largely the result of a $97 million increase in domestic employee
benefit costs, including incentives; an $86 million increase in customer freight expense, primarily due to increased fuel costs; a $46 million increase in consumer marketing spending; and $23 million of increases in our environmental reserves.

Net interest expense for fiscal 2006 totaled $399 million, lower than interest
expense for fiscal 2005 of $455 million, primarily as the result of debt pay down and the maturation of interest rate swaps.
Interest expense includes preferred



distributions paid on subsidiary minority interests. We have in place an amount of interest
rate swaps that convert $500 million of fixed-rate debt to floating rates. Taking into account the effect of our interest rate
swaps, the average interest rate on our total outstanding debt and subsidiary minority interests was 6.4 percent at May 28,
2006, compared to 5.4 percent at May 29, 2005.

In fiscal 2006, we recorded restructuring and other exit costs of $30 million,
consisting of $13 million related to the closure of our Swedesboro, New Jersey frozen dough plant; $6 million primarily for
severance costs associated with the restructuring of our frozen dough plant in Montreal, Quebec; $4 million of restructuring
costs at our Allentown, Pennsylvania frozen waffle plant, primarily related to product and production realignment; $3 million
associated with an asset impairment charge in one of our plants; and $4 million primarily associated with fiscal 2005 supply
chain initiatives. In fiscal 2005, we recorded restructuring and other exit costs of $84 million, consisting of $44 million
of charges associated with fiscal 2005 supply chain initiatives; $30 million of charges related to relocating our frozen baked
goods line from our Boston plant; $3 million of charges primarily associated with Bakeries and Foodservice severance; and $7
million of charges associated with restructuring actions prior to fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2005 supply chain initiatives were
undertaken to further increase asset utilization and reduce manufacturing and sourcing costs, resulting in decisions regarding
plant closures and production realignment. The actions included decisions to: close our flour milling plant in Vallejo, California;
close our par-baked bread plant in Medley, Florida; relocate bread production from our Swedesboro, New Jersey plant; relocate
a portion of our cereal production from Cincinnati, Ohio; close our snacks foods plant in Iowa City, Iowa; and close our dry
mix production at Trenton, Ontario.

The effective income tax rate was 34.5 percent for fiscal 2006, reflecting
the benefit of $11 million of adjustments to deferred tax liabilities associated with our International segment’s brand
intangibles. In fiscal 2005 our effective income tax rate was 36.6 percent, driven primarily by the tax impacts of our fiscal
2005 divestitures.

Earnings after tax from joint ventures totaled $64 million in fiscal 2006,
compared to $89 million in fiscal 2005. Earnings from joint ventures in fiscal 2005 included $28 million from our Snack Ventures
Europe (SVE) joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc., which was divested on February 28, 2005. In fiscal 2006, unit volume for Cereal
Partners Worldwide (CPW), our joint venture with Nestlé S.A., grew 6 percent and net sales were up 4 percent. In February
2006, CPW announced a restructuring of its manufacturing plants in the United Kingdom. Our after-tax earnings from joint ventures
was reduced by $8 million for our share of the restructuring costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and severance, incurred
in fiscal 2006. Our share of the remainder of CPW’s restructuring costs is expected to affect our after-tax earnings from
joint ventures in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008. Net sales for our Häagen-Dazs joint ventures in Asia declined 7
percent from fiscal 2005 due to an unseasonably cold winter and increased competitive pressure in Japan. 8th Continent, our
joint venture with DuPont, achieved 14 percent net sales growth in fiscal 2006.

Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 30 million from fiscal 2005.
This was due primarily to the repurchase of a significant portion of our contingently convertible debentures in October 2005
and the completion of a consent solicitation related to the remaining convertible debentures in December 2005, actions that
ended the dilutive accounting effect of these debentures in our EPS calculations. In addition, we repurchased 19 million shares
of our stock during fiscal 2006, partially offset by the issuance of shares upon stock option exercises.

FISCAL 2005 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings per diluted share of $3.08 in fiscal 2005 were up 18 percent from $2.60 in fiscal 2004 primarily
due to the gain from the redemption of our SVE interest and the reduction in interest expense. Earnings after tax increased
to $1,240 million, up 18 percent from $1,055 million in fiscal 2004. Our cash flow in 2005 was strong, enabling us to increase
our dividend payments, continue to make significant fixed asset investments to support future growth and productivity, and
reduce our total debt (notes payable and long-term debt, including current portion) by $2.0 billion.

Our net sales for fiscal 2005 were $11.2 billion, an increase of 2 percent
for the year compared to sales in fiscal 2004. Excluding the effect of the 53rd week in 2004, net sales increased 3 percent
(see page 26 for our discussion of this measure not defined by GAAP). Net sales growth was primarily driven by
2 percentage points of unit volume growth on a 52 vs. 52-week basis, primarily in U.S. Retail and International. Pricing and
product mix across many of our businesses contributed 3 percentage points of growth, however increases in promotional spending,
primarily in U.S. Retail, offset that effect. Foreign currency exchange effects contributed 1 percentage point of growth. The
components of net sales growth are shown in the following table.

Cost of sales increased by $250 million to $6,834 million, primarily driven
by unit volume increases and $170 million in commodity cost increases.

SG&A costs decreased by $25 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005,
primarily driven by four factors: a $54 million decrease in consumer marketing expense; a $37 million increase in distribution
costs; a $34 million decrease in merger-related costs for the planning and execution of the integration of Pillsbury; and a
$32 million increase in unallocated corporate items.

As detailed above in “Fiscal 2006 Consolidated Results of Operations,”
restructuring and other exit costs were $84 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $26 million in 2004.

On March 23, 2005, we commenced a cash tender offer for our outstanding
6 percent notes due in 2012. The tender offer resulted in the purchase of $500 million principal amount of the
notes. Subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer, we purchased an additional $260 million principal amount of the notes
in the open market. The aggregate purchases resulted in debt repurchase costs of $137 million, consisting of $73 million
of non-cash interest rate swap losses reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, $59 million of purchase premium
and $5 million of noncash unamortized cost of issuance expense.

On February 28, 2005, SVE was terminated and our 40.5 percent interest
was redeemed. On April 4, 2005, we sold our Lloyd’s barbecue business to Hormel Foods Corporation. We received $799
million in cash proceeds from these dispositions and recorded $499 million in gains in fiscal 2005.

Net interest expense decreased 10 percent from $508 million in fiscal 2004
to $455 million in fiscal 2005, primarily due to a reduction of our debt levels.

In fiscal 2005 our effective income tax rate increased to 36.6 percent, driven
primarily by the tax impacts of our fiscal 2005 divestitures. The higher book tax expense related to the fiscal 2005 divestitures
did not result in the payment of significant cash taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 35.0 percent in fiscal 2004.

After-tax earnings from joint venture operations grew 20 percent to reach
$89 million in fiscal 2005, compared with $74 million reported a year earlier. This increase was primarily due to unit volume
gains by our continuing joint ventures.

Average diluted shares outstanding were 409 million in fiscal 2005, down
1 percent from 413 million in fiscal 2004 as the repurchase of 17 million shares from Diageo was partially offset by stock
option exercises.

RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS

The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from
each reportable segment for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004:

Net Sales

Segment Operating Profit

We review operating results to evaluate segment performance.
Operating profit for the reportable segments excludes: unallocated corporate items of $123 million for fiscal 2006, $32 million
for fiscal 2005, and $17 million for fiscal 2004 (including a foreign currency transaction gain of $2 million in fiscal
2006 and foreign currency transaction losses of $6 million and $2 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively);
net interest; restructuring and other exit costs; gains on divestitures; debt repurchase costs; income taxes; and after-tax
earnings from joint ventures as these items are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure
of segment profitability reviewed by management. Under our supply chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse and distribution
activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result,
fixed assets, capital expenditures for long-lived assets, and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained
nor available by operating segment. See Note Sixteen to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 51 and 52
in Item Eight of this report for a reconciliation of segment operating profits and net earnings.



U.S. Retail Segment Results

For fiscal 2006, net sales for our U.S. Retail operations were $8.0 billion, up 3 percent from fiscal
2005. Net sales totaled $7.8 billion in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. The components of the changes in net sales are shown
in the following table:

Unit volume increased 2 points in fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005, led by strong
growth in our Yoplait business and volume increases in our Meals, Baking Products and Snacks operating units. Favorable trade
and coupon spending also contributed 1 point to the fiscal 2006 increase in net sales, as the rate of promotional activity
decreased on a year over year basis, largely the result of narrowing price gaps between our products and competitors’
products in several heavily promoted categories. Unit volume grew 1 percent in fiscal 2005 versus fiscal 2004, or 3 percent
on a comparable 52–week basis, with growth in all divisions except Big G cereals.

All of our U.S. Retail divisions with the exception of Big G cereals
and Pillsbury USA experienced net sales growth in fiscal 2006 as shown in the table below:

For fiscal 2006, net sales for the Yoplait division grew 14 percent over fiscal
2005 primarily due to growth in established cup yogurt lines. The Meals division’s net sales grew by 7 percent during
fiscal 2006 led by

Progresso

soup and

Hamburger Helper

. Baking Products net sales grew 6 percent over fiscal
2005 reflecting the introduction of

Warm Delights

microwaveable desserts and strong performance during the holiday baking
season. Net sales for the Snacks division grew 5 percent led by our

granola bars and

product
lines. Big G cereals net sales declined 1 percent as our merchandising activity lagged competitors’ levels, particularly
in the first half of the year. Pillsbury USA net sales also declined 1 percent due to weakness in frozen breakfast items, frozen
baked goods, and refrigerated cookies.

For fiscal 2005, Yoplait division net sales increased 8 percent with
continued growth from established cup yogurt lines. Meals division net sales were flat with growth in our

Progresso

,

and

businesses offset by declines in shelf-stable vegetables. Baking Products division
net sales increased 4 percent behind growth in mass merchandising channels. Snacks division net sales were flat. Big G cereals
net sales fell 6 percent with contributions from new products including reduced-sugar versions of

Cinnamon Toast Crunch

,

Trix

and

Cocoa Puffs

, more than offset by the loss of volume associated with merchandising activity. Net sales
growth of 2 percent for Pillsbury USA reflected gains for refrigerated cookies and bread and

Totino’s

pizza and
hot snacks.

Consumer retail purchases of our products were up 4 percent for fiscal
2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 in ACNielsen measured outlets and Wal-Mart. In fiscal 2005, retail dollar sales for our major
brands grew 3 percent overall. The table below provides our retail dollar sales growth for major products for the past two

Operating profit of $1.78 billion in fiscal 2006 improved $60 million, or
3 percent, over fiscal 2005. Unit volume increases accounted for approximately $83 million of the improvement. Net pricing
realization (defined as the impact of list and promoted price increases net of trade and other promotion costs) and product
mix of $90 million exceeded manufacturing and distribution rate increases of $62 million. Increases in consumer marketing spending
of $28 million accounted for a majority of the remainder of the change.

Fiscal 2005 operating profit was $1.72 billion, down $90 million, or 5 percent,
versus fiscal 2004. Unit volume growth contributed approximately $13 million. Cost of sales increased by $161 million, driven
primarily by commodity



cost increases, and net pricing realization did not contribute to offset those increased costs. SG&A costs decreased by
$54 million, primarily due to decreases in consumer marketing spending.

International Segment Results

For fiscal 2006, net sales for our International segment were $1.84 billion, up 6 percent. Net sales
totaled $1.72 billion in fiscal 2005 compared to $1.55 billion in 2004. The components of net sales growth are shown in

Operating profits for fiscal 2006 grew to $201 million, up 18 percent from
the prior year, with foreign currency exchange effects contributing 2 percentage points of that growth. Improvement in unit
volume contributed $24 million; net pricing realization of $46 million more than offset the effects of supply chain cost changes;
and consumer marketing spending increased $24 million.

Operating profits grew to $171 million in fiscal 2005, 44 percent above fiscal
2004’s $119 million. Foreign currency exchange effects contributed 9 percentage points of that growth. The unit volume
increase in fiscal 2005 contributed approximately $27 million; net price realization more than offset increases in cost of
sales; and SG&A costs increased $29 million.

Bakeries and Foodservice Segment Results

For fiscal 2006, net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment increased 2 percent to $1.78 billion.
Net sales decreased slightly to $1.74 billion in fiscal 2005 compared to $1.76 billion in fiscal 2004. The components of the

Fiscal 2006 unit volume was flat as compared to fiscal 2005, with net price
realization and product mix making up the primary increase in net sales growth for the fiscal year. In fiscal 2005, unit volume
was down 5 percent compared with fiscal 2004, or down 3 percent on a comparable 52-week basis, reflecting softness in shipments
to our foodservice distributors and bakery customers that was partially offset by growth in sales to convenience stores.

The change in net sales by major customer category is set forth in the following

Operating profits for the segment were $139 million in fiscal 2006, up 4 percent
from $134 million in fiscal 2005. Unit volume was flat, and pricing actions essentially covered manufacturing and distribution
rate increases of $39 million.

Fiscal 2005 operating profits were up slightly at $134 million versus $132
million in fiscal 2004. The unit volume decline reduced earnings by $22 million, but $70 million of net pricing realization
more than offset manufacturing and distribution rate increases.

Unallocated Corporate Items

For fiscal 2006, unallocated corporate expenses were $123 million compared to $32 million in fiscal
2005. Fiscal 2006 included: higher domestic employee benefit expense, including incentives, that increased by $61 million over



fiscal 2005; increases in environmental reserves of $23 million; and a $10 million write-down of the asset value of a low-income
housing investment.

Unallocated corporate expenses in fiscal 2005 included $18 million
in costs (classified as cost of sales) associated with restructuring and other exit activities. Fiscal 2004 expense was $17
million, including merger-related costs of $34 million.

Joint Ventures

Net sales growth for CPW in fiscal 2006 was restrained by unfavorable foreign currency effects. Our
share of after-tax joint venture earnings decreased from $89 million in fiscal 2005 to $64 million in fiscal 2006. As noted
above, this reflects the absence of SVE earnings and the inclusion of $8 million of restructuring costs for CPW in fiscal 2006.

Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings increased from $74 million in
fiscal 2004 to $89 million in fiscal 2005, primarily due to unit volume gains in our continuing ventures.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

It is our view that changes in the general rate of inflation have not had a significant effect on
profitability over the three most recent fiscal years other than as noted above related to commodities and employee benefit
costs. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices. Our risk management
practices are discussed on pages 7 through 10 in Item Seven A of this report.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Sources and uses of cash in the past three fiscal years are shown in the following table. Over the
most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $4.9 billion in cash. In fiscal 2006, cash flow from operations
totaled nearly $1.8 billion. The increase in cash flows from operations from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was primarily the result
of increases in accrued compensation and accrued income taxes. The increase in cash flows from operations from fiscal
2004 to fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of increases in accrued income taxes resulting from cash benefits from the utilization
of capital losses for tax purposes.

In fiscal 2006, capital investment for land, buildings and equipment decreased
to $360 million from $434 million in fiscal 2005. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $425 million in fiscal 2007.

Dividends paid in fiscal 2006 totaled $485 million, or $1.34 per share, an
8 percent increase from fiscal 2005 dividends of $1.24 per share. Our Board of Directors announced a quarterly dividend increase
from $0.31 per share to $0.33 per share effective with the dividend paid on August 1, 2005, a quarterly dividend increase
to $0.34 per share effective with the dividend paid on February 1, 2006, and another quarterly dividend increase to $0.35
per share effective with the dividend payable on August 1, 2006.

Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase from time to time of
shares of our common stock subject to a maximum of 170 million shares held in our treasury.



During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 19 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $892 million, of which
$7 million settled after the end of our fiscal year. In fiscal 2005, we repurchased 17 million shares of common stock for an
aggregate purchase price of $771 million. A total of 146 million shares were held in treasury at May 28, 2006.

We also used cash from operations to repay $189 million in outstanding debt
in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, we repaid nearly $2.2 billion of debt, including the purchase of $760 million principal amount
of our 6 percent notes due in 2012. Fiscal 2005 debt repurchase costs were $137 million, consisting of $73 million
of noncash interest rate swap losses reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, $59 million of purchase premium
and $5 million of noncash unamortized cost of issuance expense.

Capital Structure

We have $2.1 billion of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months and
classified as current, including $131 million that may mature in fiscal 2007 based on the put rights of those note holders.
We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to
meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.

On October 28, 2005, we repurchased a significant portion of our zero
coupon convertible debentures pursuant to put rights of the holders for an aggregate purchase price of $1.33 billion, including
$77 million of accreted original issue discount. These debentures had an aggregate principal amount at maturity of $1.86 billion.
We incurred no gain or loss from this repurchase. As of May 28, 2006, there were $371 million
in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the debentures outstanding, or $268 million of accreted value. We used proceeds
from the issuance of commercial paper to fund the purchase price of the debentures. We also have reclassified the remaining
zero coupon convertible debentures to long-term debt based on the October 2008 put rights of the holders.

On March 23, 2005, we commenced a cash tender offer for our outstanding
6 percent notes due in 2012. The tender offer resulted in the purchase of $500 million principal amount of the
notes. Subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer, we purchased an additional $260 million principal amount of the notes
in the open market. The aggregate purchases resulted in the debt repurchase costs as discussed above.

Our minority interests consist of interests in certain of our subsidiaries
that are held by third parties. General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC), our subsidiary, holds the manufacturing assets and intellectual
property associated with the production and retail sale of Big G ready-to-eat cereals,

Progresso

soups and

Old El
Paso

products. In May 2002, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sold 150,000 Class A preferred membership interests in
GMC to an unrelated third-party investor in exchange for $150 million, and in October 2004, another of our wholly owned subsidiaries
sold 835,000 Series B-1 preferred membership interests in GMC in exchange for $835 million. All interests in GMC, other than
the 150,000 Class A interests and 835,000 Series B-1 interests, but including all managing member interests, are held by our
wholly owned subsidiaries. In fiscal 2003, General Mills Capital, Inc. (GM Capital), a subsidiary formed for the purpose of
purchasing and collecting our receivables, sold $150 million of its Series A preferred stock to an unrelated third-party investor.

The Class A interests of GMC receive quarterly preferred distributions at
a floating rate equal to (i) the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 90 basis points, divided by (ii) 0.965. This rate will be adjusted
by agreement between the third-party investor holding the Class A interests and GMC every five years, beginning in June 2007.
Under certain circumstances, GMC also may be required to be dissolved and liquidated, including, without limitation, the bankruptcy
of GMC or its subsidiaries, failure to deliver the preferred distributions, failure to comply with portfolio requirements,
breaches of certain covenants, lowering of our senior debt rating below either Baa3 by Moody’s or BBB by Standard &
Poor’s, and a failed attempt to remarket the Class A interests as a result of a breach of GMC’s obligations to assist
in such remarketing. In the event of a liquidation of GMC, each member of GMC would receive the amount of its then current
capital account balance. The managing member may avoid liquidation in most circumstances by exercising an option to purchase
the Class A interests.

The Series B-1 interests of GMC are entitled to receive quarterly preferred
distributions at a fixed rate of 4.5 percent per year, which is scheduled to be reset to a new fixed rate through
a remarketing in October 2007. Beginning in October 2007, the managing member of GMC may elect to repurchase the Series B-1
interests for an amount equal to the holder’s then current capital account balance plus any applicable make-whole amount.
GMC is not required to purchase the Series B-1 interests nor may these investors put these interests to us. The Series B-1
interests will be exchanged for shares of our perpetual preferred stock upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
our senior unsecured debt rating falling below either Ba3 as rated by Moody’s or BB- as rated by Standard & Poor’s
or Fitch, Inc.,



our bankruptcy or liquidation, a default on any of our senior indebtedness resulting in an acceleration of indebtedness having
an outstanding principal balance in excess of $50 million, failing to pay a dividend on our common stock in any fiscal quarter,
or certain liquidating events. If GMC fails to make a required distribution to the holders of Series B-1 interests when due,
we will be restricted from paying any dividend (other than dividends in the form of shares of common stock) or other distributions
on shares of our common or preferred stock, and may not repurchase or redeem shares of our common or preferred stock, until
all such accrued and undistributed distributions are paid to the holders of the Series B-1 interests.

For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations
and cash flows of GMC and GM Capital are included in our consolidated financial statements. The third-party investors’
Class A and Series B-1 interests in GMC and the preferred stock of GM Capital are reflected as minority interests on our consolidated
balance sheets, and the return to the third party investors is reflected in interest expense, net, in the consolidated statements
of earnings. See Note Eight to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 43 and 44 in Item Eight for more
information regarding our minority interests.

At May 28, 2006, our cash and cash equivalents included $11 million
in GMC and $21 million in GM Capital that are restricted from use for our general corporate purposes pursuant to the terms
of our agreements with third-party minority interest investors.

In October 2004, we entered into a forward purchase contract under
which we are obligated to deliver between approximately 14 million and 17 million shares of our common stock in October 2007,
subject to adjustment under certain circumstances, in exchange for $750 million of cash or, in certain circumstances, securities
of an affiliate of the forward counterparty.

The following table, when reviewed in conjunction with the capital structure

Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We can issue
commercial paper in the United States, Canada and Europe. Our commercial paper borrowings are supported by $2.95 billion of
fee-paid committed credit lines and $335 million in uncommitted lines. On October 21, 2005, we entered into a new $1.1 billion
364-day credit facility expiring in October 2006 and a new $1.1 billion five-year credit facility expiring in October 2010.
These new facilities replaced our $1.1 billion credit facility that would have expired in January 2006 and our $750 million
credit facility that would have expired in April 2006. We also have a $750 million five-year credit facility that will expire
in January 2009. Our credit facilities, certain of our long-term debt agreements and our minority interests
contain restrictive covenants. At May 28, 2006, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.

The following table details the fee-paid committed credit lines we had available
as of May 28, 2006:

We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC covering
the sale of debt securities, common stock, preference stock, depository shares, securities warrants, purchase contracts, purchase
units and units. As of May 28, 2006, approximately $5.1 billion remained available under the shelf registration for future
use.

We believe that two important measures of financial strength are the ratio
of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow (defined as net cash provided by operating activities) to debt
(defined as notes payable plus long-term debt, including current portion). Our fixed charge coverage in fiscal 2006 was 4.6
compared to 4.7 in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 was favorably impacted by the gain on our disposition of our 40.5 percent equity
interest in SVE. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio increased to 29 percent in fiscal 2006 from 28 percent in fiscal 2005.
Currently, Standard and Poor’s Corporation has ratings of BBB+ on our publicly held long-term debt and A-2 on our commercial
paper. Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. has ratings of Baa2 for our long-term debt and P-2 for our commercial paper. Fitch
Ratings, Inc. rates our long-term debt BBB+ and our commercial paper F-2. Dominion Bond Rating Service in Canada currently
rates General Mills as A-low. These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, are subject to revision
or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

We also believe that growth in return on average capital is a key measure,
and it is used for management performance ratings. Return on average capital increased from 10.0 percent in 2005 to 10.6 percent
in 2006 due to earnings growth and disciplined use of cash.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

It is not our general business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements nor is it our
policy to issue



guarantees to third parties. We have, however, issued guarantees and comfort letters of $171 million for the debt and other
obligations of unconsolidated affiliates, primarily for CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally
limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases, which totaled $408 million at May 28,
2006.

At May 28, 2006, we had invested in four variable interest entities (VIEs).
We are the primary beneficiary (PB) of General Mills Capital, Inc. (GM Capital), a subsidiary that we consolidate as set forth
in Note Eight to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 43 and 44 in Item Eight of this report.
We also have an interest in a contract manufacturer at our former facility in Geneva, Illinois. Even though we are the PB,
we have not consolidated this entity because it is not material to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity
at May 28, 2006. This entity had property and equipment of $50 million and long-term debt of $50 million at May 28, 2006. We
are not the PB of the remaining two VIEs. Our maximum exposure to loss from these VIEs is limited to the $150 million minority
interest in GM Capital, the contract manufacturer’s debt and our $6 million of equity investments in the two
remaining VIEs.

The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing
contractual obligations, including payments due by period. The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for
raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer-directed marketing commitments
that support our brands. The net fair value of our interest rate and equity swaps was $159 million at May 28, 2006, based
on market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received
to settle those instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations primarily consist of income taxes, accrued compensation
and benefits, and miscellaneous liabilities. We are unable to estimate the timing of the payments for these items. We do not
have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our defined-benefit retirement and other postretirement
benefit plans. Further information on these plans, including our expected contributions for fiscal 2007, is set forth in Note
Thirteen to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 47 through 50 in Item Eight
of this report.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please see Note One to the Consolidated
Financial Statements appearing on pages 35 through 37 in Item Eight of this report. Our significant
accounting estimates are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations.
These policies include our accounting for trade and consumer promotion activities; goodwill and other intangible asset impairments;
income taxes; and pension and other postretirement benefits.

Trade and Consumer Promotion Activities

We report sales net of certain coupon and trade promotion costs. The consumer coupon costs recorded
as a reduction of sales are based on the estimated redemption value of those coupons, as determined by historical patterns
of coupon redemption and consideration of current market conditions such as competitive activity in those product categories.
The trade promotion costs include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising
or in-store displays, discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices, and payments to gain distribution of new products.
The cost of these activities is recognized as the related revenue is recorded, which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure.
The recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are made
based on the quantity of customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities, and other factors. Differences
between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate
in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade and consumer promotion liability was $339 million as of May 28, 2006, and $283
million as of May 29, 2005.

Our unit volume in the last week of each quarter is consistently higher than
the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter. In comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks
of a quarter, the final week of each quarter has approximately two to four days’ worth of incremental shipments (based
on a five-day week), reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter. This increased activity includes
promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal
demand early in the next quarter, as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets. If, due to quarter-end
promotions or other reasons, our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than end-consumer demand will require
in future periods, our sales level in future reporting periods could be adversely affected.



Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairments

Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase prices of acquired companies and the related
fair values of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for each
of our reporting units. We compare the carrying amount of goodwill for a reporting unit with its fair value and if the carrying
amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment has occurred.

Finite and indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily brands, are also
tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible.

Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow
model using inputs from our annual long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth
assumptions and other factors. We have completed our annual impairment testing and determined none of our goodwill or other
intangible assets was impaired.

Income Taxes

Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to
us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax
issues. We accrue liabilities in current income taxes payable for potential assessments related to uncertain tax positions
in a variety of taxing jurisdictions. Historically, our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been reasonably
accurate. The current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items, except for the accounting
for losses recorded as part of the Pillsbury transaction. Management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these
matters, including the accounting for losses recorded as part of the Pillsbury transaction, will not have a material effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

We have defined-benefit retirement plans covering most U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom employees.
Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. The hourly plans include various
monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws.
Our principal retirement plan covering domestic salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would vest
in plan participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control.

We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of
our U.S. and Canadian retirees. The salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on
years of service. We fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis and made $95 million of voluntary
contributions to these plans in fiscal 2006.

Actuarial Assumptions

We recognize benefits provided during retirement
over the plan participants’ active working life. Accordingly, we must use various actuarial assumptions to predict and
measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Actuarial assumptions that require significant
management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated
benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations
for our benefit plans, how we derive the market-related values of assets and the health care cost trend rates.

Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets

Our expected rate of return on
plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future
long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services and investment managers), and long-term
inflation assumptions.

The investment objective for our pension and other postretirement benefit
plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. The goal is to optimize the long-term
return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The pension and postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across
asset classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations.
For the pension and other postretirement plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 30 percent to U.S. equities;
20 percent to international equities; 10 percent to private equities; 30 percent to fixed income; and 10 percent
to real assets (real estate, energy and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically
around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.

Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) were 16 percent,
9 percent, 11 percent, 12 percent and 12 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 year
periods ended May 28, 2006.

For fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, we assumed a rate of return of 9.6 percent
on our pension plan assets and our other postretirement plan assets.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 50 basis
points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2007 by approximately $18 million.



Discount Rates

Our discount rate assumptions are determined
annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our pension and other postretirement obligations. Those same discount
rates also are used to determine pension and other postretirement income and expense for the following fiscal year.
We work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using
high-quality corporate bond yields, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our
credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate
assumptions. The discount rates used in our pension and other postretirement assumptions were 5.55 percent and 5.5 percent,
respectively, for the obligations as of May 29, 2005, and for our fiscal 2006 income and expense, and 6.65 percent for
the obligations as of May 30, 2004, and for our fiscal 2005 income and expense.

Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points would increase our net pension
and postretirement expense for fiscal 2007 by approximately $24 million.

Market-Related Value

We base our determination of pension expense or income
on a market-related valuation of assets which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment
gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are
the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based
on the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year
period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

We review our health care trend rates annually.
Our review is based on data and information we collect about our health care claims experience
and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall
industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend
rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short term expectations.
Our current health care cost trend rate assumption is 11 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 10 percent
for retirees under age 65. These rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 5.2 percent is reached in
2013 for retirees over age 65 and 2014 for retirees under age 65. The trend rates are applicable
for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate
is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate
health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the
postretirement benefit plans.

If the health care cost trend rate increased by 1 percentage point in each
future year, the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of postretirement expense for fiscal 2007 would increase
by $7 million, and the postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 28, 2006, would increase by $90 million.

Financial Statement Impact

In fiscal 2006, we recorded net pension
and postretirement expense of $25 million compared to $6 million in fiscal 2005 and $5 million in fiscal 2004.

As of May 28, 2006, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses
of $464 million on our pension plans and $317 million on our postretirement plans, primarily as the result of decreases in
our discount rate assumptions. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income
and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP.

For our fiscal 2007 pension and other postretirement income and expense estimate,
we have increased the discount rate to 6.55 percent for our pension liabilities and 6.5 percent for our other postretirement
liabilities, based on interest rates and our credit spread as of May 28, 2006. The expected rate of return on plan
assets remains 9.6 percent. Actual future net pension and postretirement income or expense will depend on investment performance,
changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension and postretirement
plans.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 123(Revised) “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123R), which generally requires public companies to
measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair
value and to recognize this cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the
award. The standard is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, with several transition
options regarding prospective versus retrospective application. We will adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2007,
using the modified prospective method. Accordingly, prior year results will not be restated, but fiscal 2007 results will be
presented as if we had applied the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation from the beginning of fiscal
1997. We currently expect the impact of adopting the fair value method of valuing stock awards to be approximately $0.11 to
$0.12 per diluted share for fiscal 2007. However, the actual impact on fiscal 2007 will be largely dependent



on the particular structure of stock-based awards granted during fiscal 2007 and various market factors that affect the fair
value of awards. We are evaluating whether to allocate these costs to our operating segments. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits
of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating
cash flow as currently required, thereby reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in periods
following adoption. While those amounts cannot be estimated for future periods, the amount of operating cash flows generated
in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was $41 million for fiscal 2006, $62 million for fiscal 2005 and $63 million
for fiscal 2004. See Note One to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 35 through 37 in
Item Eight of this report.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs –
An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” SFAS No. 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage). SFAS No. 151 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal
2007. We do not expect SFAS No. 151 to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies when tax benefits should be recorded in financial statements,
requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters and indicates how any tax reserves should be classified
in a balance sheet. FIN 48 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. We are evaluating the impact of FIN 48
on our results of operations and financial condition.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

We have included in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures,
we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP
measure, an explanation of why our management believes the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors and any
additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should
be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. Fiscal years prior to 2004 are presented in support
of our discussion of these measures outside of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Diluted EPS excluding the effects of our convertible debentures and the net benefit of gains on divestitures and debt repurchase
costs:

This non-GAAP measure is used in internal management reporting and as a component of the Board of
Directors’ rating of our performance for management and employee incentive compensation. Management and the Board of Directors
believe that this measure provides useful information to investors as it eliminates the effects of infrequently occurring events,
thereby improving the comparability of year-to-year results of operations.



Total segment operating profit:

This non-GAAP measure is used in internal management reporting and as a component of the Board of
Directors’ rating of our performance for management and employee incentive compensation. Management and the Board of Directors
believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we
use to evaluate segment performance. Operating profit for the reportable segments and total segment operating profit exclude
unallocated corporate items; net interest; restructuring and other exit costs; gains on divestitures; debt repurchase
costs; income taxes; and after-tax earnings from joint ventures as these items are centrally managed at the corporate level.
See Note Sixteen to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 51 and 52 in Item Eight of this report for
a reconciliation of segment operating profits and net earnings.

Return on average total capital:

This non-GAAP measure is used in internal management reporting and as a component of the Board of
Directors’ rating of our performance for management and employee incentive compensation. Management and the Board of Directors
believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the utilization of
capital and it eliminates the effects of infrequently occurring events, thereby improving the year-to-year comparability.



Change in net sales excluding the effect of the 53

rd

week:

Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday of May. While our typical fiscal year includes 52 weeks, every
5 or 6 years our fiscal year includes a 53

rd

week, as it did in the fiscal year ended May 30, 2004.
That 53

rd

week impacts the comparability of annual results. To view our results on a comparable basis, we have provided
net sales growth information on a comparable 52-week basis. The effect of the 53

rd

week was determined using one-fifth
of the values of the five-week month of May 2004.

Ongoing joint ventures:

Our interest in SVE was redeemed in February 2005. To view the performance of our joint ventures on
an ongoing basis, we have provided certain information excluding SVE.



ITEM 7A

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity
prices and equity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal course
of business, we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions, authorized
under our policies that place clear controls on these activities. The counterparties in these transactions are generally highly
rated institutions. We establish credit limits for each counterparty. Our hedging transactions include but are not limited
to a variety of derivative financial instruments.

Interest Rates

We manage our debt structure and our interest rate
risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt and derivatives. We use interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest
rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce volatility of our financing costs. Generally under
these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts
based on an agreed notional principal amount. Our primary exposure is to U.S. interest rates. As of May 28, 2006, we had
$7.0 billion of aggregate notional principal amount (the principal amount on which the fixed or floating interest rate is calculated)
outstanding. This includes notional amounts of offsetting swaps that neutralize our exposure to interest rates on other interest
rate swaps. See Note Six to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 40 through 42 in Item
Eight of this report.

Foreign Currency Rates

Foreign currency fluctuations can affect
our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts and
option contracts to selectively hedge our cash flow exposure to changes in exchange rates. These contracts function as hedges,
since they change in value inversely to the change created in the underlying exposure as foreign exchange rates fluctuate.
Our primary U.S. dollar exchange rate exposures are with the Canadian dollar, the euro, the Australian dollar, the Mexican
peso and the British pound.

Commodities

Many commodities we use in the production and distribution
of our products are exposed to market price risks. We manage this market risk through an integrated set of financial instruments,
including purchase orders, noncancelable contracts, futures contracts, options and swaps. Our primary commodity price exposures
are to cereal grains, sugar, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, meats, vegetable oils, and other agricultural products, as
well as paper and plastic packaging materials, operating supplies and energy.

Equity Instruments

Equity price movements affect our compensation
expense as certain investments owned by our employees are revalued. We use equity swaps to manage this market risk.

Value at Risk

These estimates are intended to measure the maximum
potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity
prices, or equity prices under normal market conditions. A Monte Carlo (VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market risk
for our exposures. The models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level.

The VAR calculation used historical interest rates, foreign exchange rates
and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the
future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics

TM

data set. The calculations are not intended to represent
actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates
with the underlying exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally
offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures. The positions included in the calculations
were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity swaps, futures and options; and equity instruments.
The calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities-related positions that are hedged by these
market-risk-sensitive instruments.

The table below presents the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair
value for our interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding on May 28,
2006 and May 29, 2005, and the average amount outstanding during the year ended May 28, 2006. The amounts were calculated
using the VAR methodology described above.

ITEM 8

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of General Mills, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The
Company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and the Board of Directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Under the supervision and with the participation
of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM REGARDING INTERNAL
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

General Mills, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). General Mills’ management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that General Mills maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, General Mills maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2006, based on criteria established
in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 28,
2006 and May 29, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive
income, and cash flows, for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended May 28, 2006, and our report dated
July 27, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES

The management of General Mills, Inc. is responsible for the fairness and accuracy of the consolidated
financial statements. The statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted
in the United States, using management’s best estimates and judgments where appropriate. The financial information throughout
this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with our consolidated financial statements.

Management has established a system of internal controls that provides reasonable
assurance that assets are adequately safeguarded and transactions are recorded accurately in all material respects, in accordance
with management’s authorization. We maintain a strong audit program that independently evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness
of internal controls. Our internal controls provide for appropriate separation of duties and responsibilities, and there are
documented policies regarding use of our assets and proper financial reporting. These formally stated and regularly communicated
policies demand highly ethical conduct from all employees.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets regularly with management,
internal auditors and our independent auditors to review internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters. The independent
auditors, internal auditors and employees have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time.

The Audit Committee reviewed and approved the Company’s annual financial
statements and recommended to the full Board of Directors that they be included in the Annual Report. The Audit Committee also
recommended to the Board of Directors that the independent auditors be reappointed for fiscal 2007, subject to ratification
by the stockholders at the annual meeting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

General Mills, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Mills,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 28, 2006 and May 29, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’
equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended May 28, 2006.
In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements we also have audited the accompanying financial statement
schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 28, 2006 and
May 29, 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year
period ended May 28, 2006 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
accompanying financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of General Mills’ internal control over financial reporting
as of May 28, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated July 27, 2006 expressed an unqualified
opinion on management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

Our consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries in which it has a controlling financial
interest. Intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior years’ amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in May. Fiscal years 2006 and 2005 each consisted of 52 weeks,
and fiscal 2004 consisted of 53 weeks. Our International segment, with the exception of Canada and our export operations, is
reported for the 12 calendar months ended April 30.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Inventories

Most U.S. inventories are
valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. Grain inventories are valued at market. The
balance of the U.S. inventories and inventories of consolidated operations outside of the U.S. are valued at the lower of cost,
using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or market.

Shipping costs associated with the distribution of finished product to our
customers are recorded as selling, general and administrative expense and are recognized when the related finished product
is shipped to the customer.

Land, Buildings, Equipment and Depreciation

Land is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment are recorded at historical cost and depreciated
over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operating
costs. Buildings are usually depreciated over 40 to 50 years, and equipment is usually depreciated over three to 15 years.
Accelerated depreciation methods generally are used for income tax purposes. When an item is sold or retired, the accounts are
relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciation; the resulting gains and losses, if any, are recognized in earnings.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated
undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the
asset group. Asset groups are identifiable and largely independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss
would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted
cash flows or independent appraisals as appropriate.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase prices of acquired companies and the related fair values
of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually for each of our reporting
units and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing compares
the carrying amount of goodwill for a reporting unit with its fair value. Fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flows.
When the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment has occurred. We have completed our annual impairment
testing and determined none of our goodwill is impaired.

The costs of patents, copyrights and other intangible assets with finite lives
are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangibles with indefinite lives, principally brands, are carried at cost.
Finite and indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated
undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the intangible. Measurement of an impairment loss would be
based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible over its fair value. We have completed our annual impairment testing
and determined none of our other intangible assets are impaired.

Investments in Joint Ventures

Our
investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of
undistributed earnings or losses. We also receive royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily
research and development) and record the tax impact of certain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships.

Variable Interest Entities

At May 28, 2006,
we had invested in four variable interest entities (VIEs). We are the primary beneficiary (PB) of General Mills Capital, Inc. (GM
Capital), a subsidiary that we consolidate as set forth in Note Eight. We also have an interest in a contract manufacturer at our
former facility in Geneva, Illinois. Even though we are the PB, we have not consolidated this entity because it is not material to
our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity at May 28, 2006. This entity had property and equipment of $50
million and long-term debt of $50 million at May 28, 2006. We are not the PB of the remaining two VIEs. Our maximum exposure to
loss from these VIEs is limited to the $150 million minority interest in GM Capital, the contract manufacturer’s debt and our
$6 million equity investments in the remaining two VIEs.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize sales
revenue upon acceptance of the shipment by our customers. Sales are reported net of consumer coupon, trade promotion and other
costs, including estimated returns. Coupons are



expensed when distributed based on estimated redemptions. Trade promotions are expensed based on
estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs. We generally do not allow a right of return. However, on
a limited case-by-case basis with prior approval, we may allow customers to return product in saleable condition for
redistribution to other customers or outlets. Returns are expensed as reductions of net sales.

Advertising Production Costs

We expense the
production costs of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.

Research and Development

All expenditures
for research and development are charged against earnings in the year incurred.

Foreign Currency Translation

Results of
foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates each month. Assets and liabilities of these
operations are translated at the period-end exchange rates, and the differences from historical exchange rates are reflected
within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Stockholders’ Equity as cumulative translation adjustments.

Derivative Instruments

We use derivatives
primarily to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. All derivatives are
recognized on the Condolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or management’s estimate of their
fair value and are recorded in either current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair
values of derivatives are recorded in earnings or other comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is designated as a
hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged
transaction ceases to exist, any associated amounts reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings at that
time. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings in the current period.

Stock-based Compensation

We use the
intrinsic value method for measuring the cost of compensation paid in our common stock. This method defines our cost as the excess
of the stock’s market value at the time of the grant over the amount that the employee is required to pay. Our stock option
plans require that the employee’s payment (i.e., exercise price) be at least the market value as of the grant date.

Restricted share awards, including restricted stock and restricted stock units,
are measured at the fair market value of our stock on the date of the award, and are initially recorded in Stockholders’
Equity as unearned compensation, net of estimated forfeitures. Unearned compensation is amortized to compensation expense on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net earnings and
earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS)
No. 123, (SFAS 123) “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to all employee stock-based compensation, net of
estimated forfeitures.

The weighted-average grant date fair values of the employee stock options
granted were estimated as $8.04 in fiscal 2006, $8.32 in fiscal 2005, and $8.54 in fiscal 2004 using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS
No. 123(Revised) “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123R), which generally requires public companies to measure the cost
of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value and to recognize
this cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The standard
is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, with several transition options regarding
prospective versus retrospective application. We will adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, using the modified
prospective method. Accordingly, prior year results will not be restated, but fiscal 2007 results will



be presented as if we had applied the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation from the beginning of fiscal
1997. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a
financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required, thereby reducing net operating cash flows
and increasing net financing cash flows in periods following adoption. While those amounts cannot be estimated for future periods,
the amount of operating cash flows generated in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was $41 million for fiscal 2006,
$62 million for fiscal 2005 and $63 million for fiscal 2004.

Certain equity-based compensation plans contain provisions that accelerate
vesting of awards upon retirement, disability or death of eligible employees and directors. For the periods presented, we generally
recognized stock compensation expense over the stated vesting period of the award, with any unamortized expense recognized
immediately if an acceleration event occurred. SFAS No. 123R specifies that a stock-based award is vested when the employee’s
retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service. Accordingly, beginning in fiscal 2007, we will
prospectively revise our expense attribution method so that the related compensation cost is recognized
immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement
eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period.

Use of Estimates

Preparing our consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from our estimates.

New Accounting Standards

The FASB ratified in October 2004, Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share” (EITF
04-8). EITF 04-8 was effective for us in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of EITF 04-8 increased diluted shares
outstanding to give effect to shares that were contingently issuable related to our zero coupon convertible debentures issued
in October 2002. Also, net earnings used for earnings per share calculations were adjusted, using the if-converted method.
See Note Eleven.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges
of Nonmonetary Assets – An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.” SFAS 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement
for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial
substance. The adoption of SFAS 153 did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting
for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” (FIN 47). FIN 47 requires that liabilities be recognized for the fair value
of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably
estimated. We adopted FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and it did not have a material impact on our results of operations
or financial condition.

2.   Acquisitions and Divestitures

On March 3, 2006, we acquired Elysèes Consult S.A., the franchise operator of a

Häagen-Dazs

shop in France. On November 21, 2005, we acquired Croissant King, a producer of frozen pastry products in Australia. On
October 31, 2005, we acquired a controlling financial interest in Pinedale Holdings PTE. Limited, an operator of

Häagen-Dazs

cafes in Singapore and Malaysia. The aggregate purchase price of our fiscal 2006 acquisitions was $26 million. The pro forma
effect of these acquisitions was not material.

On February 28, 2005, Snack Ventures Europe (SVE), our snacks joint venture
with PepsiCo, Inc., was terminated and our 40.5 percent interest was redeemed. On April 4, 2005, we sold our Lloyd’s
barbecue business to Hormel Foods Corporation. We received $799 million in cash proceeds from these dispositions and recorded
$499 million in gains in fiscal 2005.

3.   Restructuring and Other Exit Costs

In fiscal 2006, we recorded restructuring and other exit costs of $30 million pursuant to approved
plans consisting of: $13 million related to the closure of our Swedesboro, New Jersey plant; $6 million related to the closure
of a production line at our Montreal, Quebec plant; $4 million related to restructuring actions at our Allentown, Pennsylvania
plant; $3 million of asset impairment charges for one of our plants; and $4 million related primarily to fiscal 2005 initiatives.
The fiscal 2006 restructuring charges included $17 million to write down assets to fair value, $7 million of severance costs
for 425 employees being terminated, and $6 million of other exit costs. The carrying value of the assets written down was $18
million.The fair values of the assets written down were determined using discounted cash flows.

The fiscal 2006 initiatives were undertaken to increase asset utilization
and reduce manufacturing costs. The actions included decisions to: close our leased frozen dough foodservice plant in Swedesboro,
New Jersey, affecting 101 employees; shut down a portion of our frozen dough foodservice plant in Montreal, Quebec, affecting
77 employees; realign and modify product and manufacturing



capabilities at our frozen waffle plant in Allentown, Pennsylvania, affecting 72 employees; and complete the fiscal 2005 initiative
to relocate our frozen baked goods line from our plant in Chelsea, Massachusetts, to another facility, affecting 175 employees.

In fiscal 2005, we recorded restructuring and other exit costs of $84 million
pursuant to approved plans, consisting of: $74 million of charges associated with fiscal 2005 supply chain initiatives; $3
million of charges associated with Bakeries and Foodservice severance charges resulting from fiscal 2004 decisions; and $7
million of charges associated with restructuring actions prior to fiscal 2005. The charges from the fiscal 2005 initiatives
included severance and pension and postretirement curtailment costs of $14 million for 551 employees being terminated, $20
million to write off assets, $30 million for the write-down of assets to their net realizable value and $10 million of other
exit costs. The carrying value of the assets written down was $36 million. Net realizable value was determined by independent
market analysis.

The fiscal 2005 initiatives were undertaken to further increase asset utilization
and reduce manufacturing and sourcing costs, resulting in decisions regarding plant closures and production realignment. The
actions included decisions to: close our flour milling plant in Vallejo, California, affecting 43 employees; close our par-baked
bread plant in Medley, Florida, affecting 42 employees; relocate bread production from our Swedesboro, New Jersey plant, affecting
110 employees; relocate a portion of our cereal production from Cincinnati, Ohio, affecting 45 employees; close our snacks
foods plant in Iowa City, Iowa, affecting 83 employees; close our dry mix production at Trenton, Ontario, affecting 53 employees;
and relocate our frozen baked goods line from our plant in Chelsea, Massachusetts to another facility.

These fiscal 2005 supply chain actions also resulted in certain associated
expenses in fiscal 2005, primarily resulting from adjustments to the depreciable life of the assets necessary to reflect the
shortened asset lives which coincided with the final production dates at the Cincinnati and Iowa City plants. These associated
expenses were recorded as cost of sales and totaled $18 million.

In fiscal 2004, we recorded restructuring and other exit costs of $26 million
pursuant to approved plans. These costs included: a severance charge for 142 employees being terminated as a result of a plant
closure in the Netherlands; costs related to a plant closure in Brazil, including a severance charge for 201 employees; costs
for the closure of our tomato canning facility in Atwater, California, including severance costs for 47 employees; adjustments
of costs associated with previously announced closures of manufacturing facilities; and a severance charge for 132 employees,
related primarily to actions in our Bakeries and Foodservice organization. The carrying value of the assets written down was
$3 million.



The analysis of our restructuring and other exit costs is as follows:

4.   Investments in Joint Ventures

We have a 50 percent equity interest in Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), a joint venture with Nestlé
S.A. that manufactures and markets cereal products outside the United States and Canada. We have guaranteed a portion of CPW’s
debt. See Note Fifteen. We have a 50 percent equity interest in 8th Continent, LLC, a domestic joint venture with DuPont to
develop and market soy-based products. We have 50 percent equity interests in the following joint ventures for the manufacture,
distribution and marketing of

Häagen-Dazs

frozen ice cream products and novelties: Häagen-Dazs Japan K.K.;
Häagen-Dazs Korea Company Limited; and Häagen-Dazs Marketing & Distribution (Philippines) Inc. We have a 49 percent
equity interest in Häagen-Dazs Distributors (Thailand) Company Limited. We also have a 50 percent equity interest in Seretram,
a joint venture with Co-op de Pau for the production of

Green Giant

canned corn in France. In May 2006, we acquired
a controlling financial interest in our Häagen-Dazs joint venture in the Philippines for less than $1 million.

Fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 results of operations include our share of the
after-tax earnings of SVE through the date of its termination on February 28, 2005.

On July 14, 2006, CPW acquired the Uncle Tobys cereal business in Australia
for approximately $385 million. This business had revenues of approximately $100 million for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2006. We funded our 50 percent share of the purchase price by making an additional equity contribution in CPW from cash generated
from our international operations, including our international joint ventures.

In February 2006, CPW announced a restructuring of its manufacturing plants
in the United Kingdom. Our after-tax earnings from joint ventures were reduced by $8 million for our share of the restructuring
costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and severance, incurred in fiscal 2006.

Our cumulative investment in these joint ventures was $186 million at the
end of fiscal 2006 and $211 million at the end of fiscal 2005. We made aggregate investments in the joint ventures of
$7 million in fiscal 2006, $15 million in fiscal 2005 and $31 million in fiscal 2004. We received aggregate dividends
from the joint ventures of $77 million in fiscal 2006, $83 million in fiscal 2005 and $60 million in fiscal 2004.

Results from our CPW joint venture are reported as of and for the twelve months
ended March 31. The Häagen-Dazs and Seretram joint venture results are reported as of and for the twelve months ended
April 30. 8th Continent’s results are presented on the same basis as our fiscal year.

Summary combined financial information for the joint ventures (including SVE
through the date of its termination on February 28, 2005) on a 100 percent basis follows:

are as follows:

Future purchase price adjustments to goodwill may occur upon the resolution
of certain income tax accounting matters. See Note Fourteen.

6.   Financial Instruments and Risk Management Activities

Financial Instruments

The carrying
values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, other current liabilities and notes payable approximate fair
value. Marketable securities are carried at fair value. As of May 28, 2006, a comparison of cost and market values of our
marketable debt and equity securities is as follows:

Earnings include realized gains from sales of available-for-sale marketable
securities of less than $1 million in fiscal 2006, $2 million in fiscal 2005 and $20 million in fiscal 2004. Gains and losses
are determined by specific identification. The aggregate unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of tax
effects, are classified in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income within Stockholders’ Equity. At May 28, 2006, we owned
twenty marketable securities with a fair market value less than cost. The fair market value of these securities was
$0.3 million below their cost.

Scheduled maturities of our marketable securities are as follows:

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $48 million as of
May 28, 2006, and $63 million as of May 29, 2005, were pledged as collateral. These assets are primarily pledged
as collateral for certain derivative contracts.

The fair values and carrying amounts of long-term debt, including the current
portion, were $4,566 million and $4,546 million at May 28, 2006, and $6,074 million and $5,893 million at May 29,
2005. The fair value of long-term debt was estimated using discounted cash flows based on our current incremental
borrowing rates for similar types of instruments.

Risk Management Activities

As a part of our ongoing business operations,
we are exposed to market risks such as



changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. To manage these risks, we may enter into various
derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options and swaps) pursuant to our established policies.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate volatility
with regard to existing variable-rate debt and planned future issuances of fixed-rate debt. We use a combination of interest
rate swaps and forward-starting swaps to reduce interest rate volatility and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus
fixed-rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions.

Variable Interest Rate Exposures – Except as discussed below, variable-to-fixed
interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, as are all hedges of forecasted issuances of debt. Effectiveness
is assessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative method or changes in the present value of interest
payments on the underlying debt. Amounts deferred to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income are reclassified into earnings
over the life of the associated debt. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and
2004.

Fixed Interest Rate Exposures – Fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps
are accounted for as fair value hedges with effectiveness assessed based on changes in the fair value of the underlying debt,
using incremental borrowing rates currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities. Effective gains and losses
on these derivatives and the underlying hedged items are recorded as interest expense. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness
was less than $1 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004.

In anticipation of the Pillsbury acquisition and other financing needs, we
entered into pay-fixed interest rate swap contracts during fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002 totaling $7.1 billion to lock in
our interest payments on the associated debt. During fiscal 2004, $750 million of these swaps matured. In fiscal 2005, $2 billion
of these swaps matured. At May 28, 2006, we still owned $3.15 billion of Pillsbury-related pay-fixed swaps that were previously
neutralized with offsetting pay-floating swaps in fiscal 2002. At May 28, 2006, $500 million of our pay-floating interest
rate swaps were designated as a fair value hedge of our 2.625 percent notes due October 2006.

In May 2006, we entered into a $100 million pay-fixed, forward-starting interest
rate swap with a fixed rate of 5.7 percent in anticipation of fixed-rate debt refinancing probable of occurring in fiscal
2007. Subsequent to May 28, 2006, we entered into an additional $600 million of pay-fixed, forward-starting interest rate swaps
with an average fixed rate of 5.7 percent.

The following table summarizes the notional amounts and weighted average interest
rates of our interest rate swaps. As discussed above, we have neutralized all of our pay-fixed swaps with pay-floating swaps;
however, we cannot present them on a net basis in the following table because the offsetting occurred with different counterparties.
Average variable rates are based on rates as of the end of the reporting period.

Foreign Exchange Transaction Risk

We
are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to third-party purchases, intercompany product
shipments and intercompany loans. Our primary U.S. dollar exchange rate exposures are with the Canadian dollar, the euro, the
Australian dollar, the Mexican peso and the British pound. Forward contracts of generally less than 12 months duration are used to
hedge some of these risks. Hedge effectiveness is assessed based on changes in forward rates. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness
was $1 million or less in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to
price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of ingredient and packaging materials. The principal raw
materials that we use are cereal grains, sugar, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, meats, vegetable oils, and other agricultural
products as well as paper and plastic packaging materials, operating supplies and energy. We use a combination of long cash
positions with suppliers, exchange-traded futures and option contracts and over-the-counter hedging mechanisms to reduce price
fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases over a period of less than two years. Except as discussed below,
commodity derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with effectiveness assessed based on changes in futures prices. The
amount of hedge ineffectiveness was a gain of $3 million in fiscal 2006, and were losses of $1 million or less in fiscal 2005 and
2004.



Other Risk Management Activities

We
enter into certain derivative contracts in accordance with our risk management strategy that do not meet the criteria for hedge
accounting, including those in our grain merchandising operation, certain foreign currency derivatives and offsetting interest
rate swaps as discussed above. Even though they may not qualify as hedges, these derivatives have the economic impact of largely
mitigating the associated risks. These derivatives were not acquired for trading purposes and are recorded at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period.

Our grain merchandising operation provides us efficient access to and more
informed knowledge of various commodities markets. This operation uses futures and options to hedge its net inventory position to
minimize market exposure. As of May 28, 2006, our grain merchandising operation had futures and options contracts that
essentially hedged its net inventory position. None of the contracts extended beyond May 2007. All futures contracts and options
are exchange-based instruments with ready liquidity and determinable market values. Neither the results of operations nor the year-end
positions of our grain merchandising operation were material.

Unrealized losses from cash flow hedges recorded in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income as of May 28, 2006, totaled $92 million, primarily related to interest rate swaps we entered into
in contemplation of future borrowings and other financing requirements (primarily related to the Pillsbury acquisition), which are
being reclassified into interest expense over the lives of the hedged forecasted transactions. The majority of the remaining gains
and losses from cash flow hedges recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as of May 28, 2006, were related to
foreign currency contracts. The net amount of the gains and losses in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as of May 28,
2006, that is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is $39 million in expense. See Note Seven
for the impact of these reclassifications on interest expense.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

We enter into interest rate, foreign exchange, and certain commodity and equity derivatives primarily with a
diversified group of highly rated counterparties. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the
counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one party. These transactions may expose us to
potential losses due to the credit risk of nonperformance by these counterparties; however, we have not incurred a material loss
nor are losses anticipated. We also enter into commodity futures transactions through various regulated exchanges.

Our top five customers in the U.S. Retail segment account for 47 percent of the
segment’s net sales. Payment terms vary depending on product categories and markets. We establish and monitor credit limits
to manage our credit risk. We have not incurred a material loss nor are any such losses anticipated.

7.   Debt

Notes Payable

The components of notes
payable and their respective weighted average interest rates at the end of the periods were as follows:

To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to
cover our outstanding short-term borrowings. As of May 28, 2006, we had $2.95 billion in committed lines and $335
million in uncommitted lines. Our committed lines consist of a $750 million five-year credit facility expiring in January 2009, a
$1.1 billion 364-day credit facility expiring in October 2006 and a new $1.1 billion five-year credit facility expiring in October
2010.

Long-term Debt

On October 28, 2005, we
repurchased a significant portion of our zero coupon convertible debentures pursuant to the put rights of the holders for an
aggregate purchase price of $1.33 billion, including $77 million of accreted original issue discount classified within financing
cash flows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. These debentures had an aggregate principal amount at maturity of $1.86
billion. We incurred no gain or loss from this repurchase. As of May 28, 2006, there were $371 million in aggregate principal
amount at maturity of the debentures outstanding, or $268 million of accreted value. We used proceeds from the issuance of
commercial paper to fund our repurchase of the debentures. We have also reclassified the remaining zero coupon convertible
debentures to long-term debt based on the put rights of the holders.

Our credit facilities, certain of our long-term debt agreements and our minority
interests contain restrictive debt covenants. At May 28, 2006, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.

On March 23, 2005, we commenced a cash tender offer for our outstanding 6
percent notes due in 2012. The tender offer resulted in the purchase of $500 million principal amount of the notes. Subsequent to
the expiration of the tender offer, we purchased an additional $260 million principal amount of the notes in the open market. The
aggregate purchases resulted in debt repurchase costs of $137 million, consisting of $73 million of noncash interest rate swap
losses reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, $59 million of purchase premium and $5 million of noncash
unamortized cost of issuance expense.



As of May 28, 2006, the $86 million recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income associated with our previously designated interest rate swaps will be reclassified to interest expense over the remaining
lives of the hedged forecasted transaction. The amount expected to be reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
to interest expense in fiscal 2007 is $33 million. The amount reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in fiscal
2006 was $33 million.

A summary of our long-term debt is as follows:

(a)

Medium-term notes of $131 million may mature in fiscal 2007 based on the put rights of these note holders.

See Note Six for a description of related interest-rate derivative instruments.

We have guaranteed the debt of our Employee Stock Ownership Plan; therefore, the
loan is reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as long-term debt with a related offset in Unearned Compensation in
Stockholders’ Equity.

Principal payments due on long-term debt in the next five years based on stated
contractual maturities or put rights of certain note holders are (in millions) $2,131 in fiscal 2007, $854 in fiscal 2008, $117 in
fiscal 2009, $55 in fiscal 2010 and $0 in fiscal 2011.

8.   Minority Interests

In April 2002, we and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries contributed assets with an aggregate fair
market value of approximately $4 billion to another wholly owned subsidiary, General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC), a limited liability
company. GMC is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Company and its subsidiaries, and has separate assets, liabilities,
businesses and operations. The contributed assets consist primarily of manufacturing assets and intellectual property associated
with the production and retail sale of Big G ready-to-eat cereals,

Progresso

soups and

Old El Paso

products. In
exchange for the contribution of these assets, GMC issued the managing membership interest and preferred membership interests to
our wholly owned subsidiaries. The managing member directs the business activities and operations of GMC and has fiduciary
responsibilities to GMC and its members. Other than rights to vote on certain matters, holders of the preferred membership
interests have no right to direct the management of GMC.

In May 2002, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sold 150,000 Class A preferred
membership interests in GMC to an unrelated third-party investor in exchange for $150 million. On October 8, 2004, another of our
wholly owned subsidiaries sold 835,000 Series B-1 preferred membership interests in GMC in exchange for $835 million. In
connection with the sale of the Series B-1 interests, GMC and its existing members entered into a Third Amended and Restated
Limited Liability Company Agreement of GMC (the LLC Agreement), setting forth, among other things, the terms of the Series B-1 and
Class A interests held by the third-party investors and the rights of those investors. Currently, all interests in GMC, other than
the 150,000 Class A interests and 835,000 Series B-1 interests, but including all managing member interests, are held by our
wholly owned subsidiaries.

The Class A interests receive quarterly preferred distributions at a floating
rate equal to (i) the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 90 basis points, divided by (ii) 0.965. The LLC Agreement requires that the
rate of the distributions on the Class A interests be adjusted by agreement between the third-party investor holding the Class A
interests and GMC every five years, beginning in June 2007. If GMC and the investor fail to mutually agree on a new rate of
preferred distributions, GMC must remarket the Class A interests to set a new distribution rate. Upon a failed remarketing, the
rate over LIBOR will be increased by 75 basis points until the next scheduled remarketing date. GMC, through its managing member,
may elect to repurchase all of the Class A interests at any time for an amount equal to the holder’s capital account, plus
any applicable make-whole amount. Under certain circumstances, GMC also may be required to be dissolved and liquidated, including,
without limitation, the bankruptcy of GMC or its subsidiaries, failure to deliver the preferred distributions, failure to comply
with portfolio requirements, breaches of certain covenants, lowering of our senior debt rating below either Baa3 by Moody’s
or BBB by Standard & Poor’s, and a failed attempt to remarket the Class A interests as a result of a breach of GMC’s
obligations to assist in such remarketing. In the event of a liquidation of GMC, each member of GMC would receive the amount of
its then capital account balance. The managing member may avoid liquidation in most circumstances by exercising an option



to purchase the Class A interests. An election to purchase the preferred membership interests could
impact our liquidity by requiring us to refinance the purchase price.

The Series B-1 interests are entitled to receive quarterly preferred
distributions at a fixed rate of 4.5 percent per year, which is scheduled to be reset to a new fixed rate through a remarketing in
October 2007. Beginning in October 2007, the managing member of GMC may elect to repurchase the Series B-1 interests for an amount
equal to the holder’s then current capital account balance plus any applicable make-whole amount. GMC is not required to
purchase the Series B-1 interests nor may these investors put these interests to us.

Upon the occurrence of certain exchange events (as described below), the Series
B-1 interests will be exchanged for shares of our perpetual preferred stock. An exchange will occur upon our senior unsecured debt
rating falling below either Ba3 as rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or BB- as rated by Standard & Poor’s or
Fitch, Inc., our bankruptcy or liquidation, a default on any of our senior indebtedness resulting in an acceleration of
indebtedness having an outstanding principal balance in excess of $50 million, failing to pay a dividend on our common stock in
any fiscal quarter, or certain liquidating events as set forth in the LLC Agreement.

If GMC fails to make a required distribution to the holders of Series B-1
interests when due, we will be restricted from paying any dividend (other than dividends in the form of shares of common stock) or
other distributions on shares of our common or preferred stock, and may not repurchase or redeem shares of our common or preferred
stock, until all such accrued and undistributed distributions are paid to the holders of the Series B-1 interests. If the required
distributions on the Series B-1 interests remain undistributed for six quarterly distribution periods, the managing member will
form a nine-member board of directors to manage GMC. Under these circumstances, the holder of the Series B-1 interests will have
the right to appoint one director. Upon the payment of the required distributions, the GMC board of directors will be dissolved.
At May 28, 2006, we have made all required distributions to the Series B-1 interests. Upon the occurrence of certain events the
Series B-1 interests will be included in our computation of diluted earnings per share as a participating security.

For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations
and cash flows of GMC are included in our consolidated financial statements. The third-party investors’ Class A and Series
B-1 interests in GMC are reflected as minority interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the return to the third party
investors is reflected as interest expense, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

In fiscal 2003, General Mills Capital, Inc. (GM Capital), a subsidiary, sold
$150 million of its Series A preferred stock to an unrelated third-party investor. GM Capital regularly purchases our receivables.
These receivables are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the $150 million purchase price for the Series A preferred
stock is reflected as minority interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The proceeds from the issuance of the preferred stock
were used to reduce short-term debt. The return to the third-party investor is reflected as interest expense, net, in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

At May 28, 2006, our cash and cash equivalents included $11 million in GMC and
$21 million in GM Capital that are restricted from use for our general corporate purposes pursuant to the terms of our agreements
with third-party minority interest investors.

9.   Stockholders’ Equity

Cumulative preference stock of 5 million shares, without par value, is authorized but unissued.

We had a stockholder rights plan that expired on February 1, 2006.

The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase, from time to time,
of common stock for our treasury, provided that the number of treasury shares shall not exceed 170 million.

In October 2004, we purchased 17 million shares of our common stock from Diageo
plc (Diageo) for $750 million, or $45.20 per share. This share repurchase was made in conjunction with Diageo’s sale of
33 million additional shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering.

Concurrently in October 2004, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. issued $750 million
of notes, which are mandatorily exchangeable for shares of our common stock. In connection with the issuance of those notes,
an affiliate of Lehman Brothers entered into a forward purchase contract with us, under which we are obligated to deliver to
such affiliate between 14 million and 17 million shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.
These shares will generally be deliverable by us in October 2007, in exchange for $750 million in cash or, in certain circumstances,
securities of an affiliate of Lehman Brothers. We recorded a $43 million fee for this forward purchase contract as an adjustment
to Stockholders’ Equity.

10.   Stock Plans

We use broad-based stock plans to help ensure management’s alignment with our stockholders’
interests. As of May 28, 2006, a total of 15,021,864 shares were available for grant in the form of stock options, restricted
shares, restricted stock units and shares of common stock under the 2005 Stock Compensation Plan (2005 Plan) through
December 31, 2007, and the 2001 Compensation Plan for Nonemployee Directors (2001 Director Plan) through September 30,
2006. Restricted shares and restricted stock units may also be granted under the Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) through
September 25, 2010. Stock-based awards now outstanding include some granted under the 1990, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998 (senior
management), 1998 (employee) and 2003 stock plans, under which no further awards may be granted. The stock plans provide for full
vesting of options, restricted shares and restricted stock units upon completion of specified service periods or in the event of a
change of control. On May 28, 2006, a total of 3,606,659 restricted shares and restricted stock units were outstanding under
all plans.

Stock Options

Options may be priced at
100 percent or more of the fair market value on the date of grant, and generally vest four years after the date of grant.
Options generally expire within 10 years and one month after the date of grant. The 2001 Director Plan allows each
nonemployee director to receive upon election and re-election to the Board of Directors options to purchase 10,000 shares of
common stock that generally vest one year, and expire within 10 years, after the date of grant.



Information on stock option activity follows:

(a)

In fiscal 2005 we changed the timing of our annual stock option grant from December to June. As a result, we
did not make an annual stock option grant during fiscal 2006. On June 26, 2006, we granted (in thousands) 5,175 stock options
at an exercise price of $51.26 per share.

Restricted Stock Awards

Stock and units settled in stock subject
to a restricted period and a purchase price, if any (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors),
may be granted to key employees under the 2005 Plan. Restricted shares and restricted stock units, up to 50 percent of the
value of an individual’s cash incentive award, may also be granted through the EIP. Certain restricted share and restricted
stock unit awards require the employee to deposit personally owned shares (on a one-for-one basis) with us during
the restricted period. Restricted shares and restricted stock units generally vest and become unrestricted four years after
the date of grant. Participants are entitled to cash dividends on such awarded shares and units, but the sale or transfer of
these shares and units is restricted during the vesting period. Participants holding restricted shares, but not restricted
stock units, are also entitled to vote on matters submitted to holders of common stock for a vote. The 2001 Director Plan allows
each nonemployee director to receive upon election and re-election to the Board 1,000 restricted stock units that generally
vest one year after the date of grant.

restricted stock units at a price per share of $51.26.

Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards was $45
million for fiscal 2006, $38 million for fiscal 2005 and $27 million for fiscal 2004.



11.   Earnings Per Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated using the following:

(a)

Shares from contingently convertible debentures are reflected using the if-converted method. On December 12,
2005, we completed a consent solicitation and entered into a supplemental indenture related to our zero coupon convertible
debentures. We also made an irrevocable election: (i) to satisfy all future obligations to repurchase debentures solely in
cash and (ii) to satisfy all future conversions of debentures (a) solely in cash up to an amount equal to the accreted value
of the debentures and (b) at our discretion, in cash, stock or a combination of cash and stock to the extent the conversion
value of the debentures exceeds the accreted value. As a result of these actions, no shares of common stock underlying the
debentures were considered outstanding after December 12, 2005, for purposes of calculating our diluted earnings per share.

(b)

Incremental shares from stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units are computed by the treasury
stock method.

The diluted EPS calculation does not include stock options for 8 million shares
in fiscal 2006, 9 million shares in fiscal 2005 and 12 million shares in fiscal 2004 that were considered anti-dilutive
because their exercise price was greater than the average market price of our stock during the period.

13.   Retirement Benefits

Pension Plans

We have defined-benefit
retirement plans covering most U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom employees. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of
service and final average compensation. The hourly plans include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our
funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried
employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would vest in plan participants if the plan is terminated within five
years of a change in control.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

We
sponsor plans that provide health-care benefits to the majority of our U.S. and Canadian retirees. The salaried health care
benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We fund related trusts for certain employees
and retirees on an annual basis and made $95 million of voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2006. Assumed health
care cost trend rates are as follows:

plan participants greater than 65 years of age and 2014 for plan participants less than 65 years of age.

We use our fiscal year-end as a measurement date for all our pension and
postretirement benefit plans.

Summarized financial information about pension and other postretirement benefit
plans is presented below. For



fiscal 2006, the impact of plan amendments on the projected benefit obligation is primarily related to
incremental benefits under agreements with the unions representing the hourly workers at certain of our U.S. cereal, dough and
foodservice plants covering the four-year period ending April 25, 2010.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined-benefit plans was
$2,689 million at May 28, 2006, and $2,868 million at May 29, 2005.

Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset
allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input
from our actuaries, investment services and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions.

Weighted-average asset allocations for the past two fiscal years for our pension
and other postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

The investment objective for the U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit
plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. The goal is to optimize the long-term
return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The pension and postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset
classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For
the pension and other postretirement plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 30 percent to U.S. equities,
20 percent to international equities, 10 percent to private equities, 30 percent to fixed income and 10 percent to
real assets (real estate, energy and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around
the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.

Contributions and Future Benefit Payments

We expect to contribute $15 million to our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans in
fiscal 2007. Estimated benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as

2012 – 2016

Certain international operations have defined-benefit pension plans that are not
presented in the tables above. These international operations had prepaid pension assets of less than $1 million at the end of
fiscal 2006 and 2005, and they had accrued pension plan liabilities of $4 million at the end of fiscal 2006 and $7 million at the
end of fiscal 2005. Pension expense associated with these plans was $3 million for fiscal 2006, $6 million for fiscal 2005 and $3
million for fiscal 2004.

Defined Contribution Plans

The General
Mills Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that covers salaried and nonunion employees. It had net assets of $2,031 million
as of May 28, 2006, and $1,797 million as of May 29, 2005. This plan is a 401(k) savings plan that includes a
number of investment funds and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). Our total expense related to defined-contribution plans
recognized was $46 million in fiscal 2006, $17 million in fiscal 2005 and $20 million in fiscal 2004.

The ESOP’s only assets are our common stock and temporary cash balances.
The ESOP’s share of the total defined contribution expense was $38 million in fiscal 2006, $11 million in fiscal 2005 and $15
million in fiscal 2004. The ESOP’s expense is calculated by the “shares allocated” method.



The ESOP uses our common stock to convey benefits to employees and, through
increased stock ownership, to further align employee interests with those of stockholders. We match a percentage of employee
contributions to the General Mills Savings Plan with a base match plus a variable year-end match that depends on annual results.
Employees receive our match in the form of common stock.

The ESOP originally purchased our common stock principally with funds borrowed
from third parties and guaranteed by us. The ESOP shares are included in net shares outstanding for the purposes of calculating
earnings per share. The ESOP’s third-party debt is described in Note Seven.

We treat cash dividends paid to the ESOP the same as other dividends. Dividends
received on leveraged shares (i.e., all shares originally purchased with the debt proceeds) are used for debt service, while
dividends received on unleveraged shares are passed through to participants.

Our cash contribution to the ESOP is calculated so as to pay off enough debt to
release sufficient shares to make our match. The ESOP uses our cash contributions to the plan, plus the dividends received on the
ESOP’s leveraged shares, to make principal and interest payments on the ESOP’s debt. As loan payments are made, shares
become unencumbered by debt and are committed to be allocated. The ESOP allocates shares to individual employee accounts on the
basis of the match of employee payroll savings (contributions), plus reinvested dividends received on previously allocated shares.
The ESOP incurred interest expense of less than $1 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. The ESOP used dividends of $4
million in fiscal 2006, $4 million in fiscal 2005 and $5 million in fiscal 2004, along with our contributions of less than $1
million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 to make interest and principal payments.

The number of shares of our common stock in the ESOP is summarized as
follows:

Executive Incentive Plan

Our Executive
Incentive Plan provides incentives to key employees who have the greatest potential to contribute to current earnings and
successful future operations. All employees at the level of vice president and above participate in the plan. These awards are
approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists solely of independent, outside directors. Awards
are based on performance against pre-established goals approved by the Committee. Profit-sharing expense was $23 million,
$17 million and $16 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

14.   Income Taxes

The components of Earnings before Income Taxes and After-tax Earnings from Joint Ventures and the
corresponding income taxes thereon are as follows:

We paid income taxes of $321 million in fiscal 2006, $227 million in fiscal 2005
and $225 million in fiscal 2004.

The following table reconciles the U.S. statutory income tax rate with our

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets
and liabilities are as follows:

Of the total valuation allowance of $858 million, $768 million relates to a
deferred tax asset for losses recorded as part of the Pillsbury acquisition. In the future, when tax benefits related to these
losses are finalized, the reduction in the valuation allowance will be allocated to reduce goodwill. Of the remaining valuation
allowance, $66 million relates to state and foreign operating loss carry forwards. In the future, if tax benefits are realized
related to the operating losses, the reduction in the valuation allowance will reduce tax expense. At May 28, 2006, we
believe it is more likely than not that the remainder of our deferred tax asset is realizable.

The carry forward period on the net tax benefited amounts of our foreign loss
carry forwards are as follows: $20 million do not expire; $5 million will expire in 2007 and 2008; $21 million will expire between
2009 and 2014; and $16 million will expire in 2018.

We have not recognized a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of $1.03
billion from our foreign operations because we do not expect those earnings to become taxable to us in the foreseeable future.

Some leases require payment of property taxes, insurance and maintenance costs
in addition to the rent payments. Contingent and escalation rent in excess of minimum rent payments and sublease income netted in
rent expense were insignificant.

Noncancelable future lease commitments (in millions) are: $92 in fiscal 2007;
$75 in fiscal 2008; $67 in fiscal 2009; $52 in fiscal 2010; $37 in fiscal 2011; and $85 after fiscal 2011, with a cumulative total
of $408. These future lease commitments will be partially offset by estimated future sublease receipts of $55 million.

We are contingently liable under guarantees and comfort letters for $171
million. The guarantees and comfort letters are principally issued to support borrowing arrangements, primarily for our joint
ventures.

We are involved in various claims, including environmental matters, arising in
the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters, either individually or
in aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

16.   Business Segment and Geographic Information

We operate exclusively in the consumer foods industry, with multiple operating segments organized
generally by product categories. We aggregate our operating segments into three reportable segments by type of customer and
geographic region as follows: U.S. Retail, 69 percent of our fiscal 2006 consolidated net sales; International, 16 percent of our
fiscal 2006 consolidated net sales; and Bakeries and Foodservice, 15 percent of our fiscal 2006 consolidated net sales.

U.S. Retail reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass
merchandisers, club stores, specialty stores and drug, dollar and discount chains operating throughout the United States. Our
major product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals, meals, refrigerated and frozen dough products, baking
products, snacks, yogurt and organic foods. Our International segment is made up of retail businesses outside of the United
States, including a retail business in Canada that largely mirrors our U.S. Retail product mix, and foodservice businesses outside
of the United States and Canada. Our Bakeries and Foodservice segment consists of products marketed throughout the United States
and Canada to retail and wholesale bakeries, commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators, restaurants, and
convenience stores.

During fiscal 2006, one customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Wal-Mart), accounted
for approximately 18 percent of our consolidated net sales and 24 percent of our sales in the U.S. Retail segment. No other
customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. At May 28,



2006, Wal-Mart accounted for 17 percent of our trade receivables invoiced in the U.S. Retail segment.
The top five customers in our U.S. Retail segment accounted for approximately 47 percent of its fiscal 2006 net sales, and
the top five customers in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment accounted for approximately 36 percent of its fiscal 2006
net sales.

Our management reviews operating results to evaluate segment performance.
Operating profit for the reportable segments excludes unallocated corporate items (including a foreign currency transaction gain
of $2 million in fiscal 2006 and foreign currency transaction losses of $6 million and $2 million in fiscal 2005
and 2004, respectively); net interest; restructuring and other exit costs; gain on divestitures; debt repurchase costs; income
taxes; and after-tax earnings from joint ventures, as these items are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded
from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by management. Under our supply chain organization, our manufacturing,
warehouse and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order to maximize efficiency and
productivity. As a result, fixed assets, capital expenditures for long-lived assets, and depreciation and amortization expenses
are neither maintained nor available by operating segment. Transactions between reportable segments were not material in the
periods presented.

segments:
