                           PART I
                              
Item 1.   Business.
   General Mills, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1928.
The  Company is engaged in the manufacture and marketing  of
consumer   foods  products.   The  terms  "General   Mills,"
"Company" and "Registrant" mean General Mills, Inc. and  its
subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.

   On  May 18, 1995, the Company sold its Gorton's division.
Gorton's is a leading marketer of frozen and canned  seafood
products  to  the grocery and food service  markets  in  the
United States and Canada.

   On  May  28, 1995, the Company made a tax-free, pro  rata
distribution  of the shares of Darden Restaurants,  Inc.,  a
newly   established  subsidiary  containing  the   Company's
restaurant  business, to the stockholders of General  Mills,
Inc.   The divested restaurant business includes Red Lobster
full-service  seafood restaurants in the United  States  and
Canada, The Olive Garden full-service Italian restaurants in
the United States and Canada, and China Coast, a new Chinese
restaurant concept.  As a result of the sale of Gorton's and
the  distribution  of  Darden,  the  Company's  consolidated
financial statements for fiscal 1995 treat Gorton's and  the
Restaurant  business as discontinued operations,  and  prior
years'  consolidated financial statements have been restated
accordingly.    See  Note  Two  to  Consolidated   Financial
Statements appearing on page 20 in the Company's 1995 Annual
Report to Stockholders, incorporated herein by reference.

   The  Company  is a leading producer of packaged  consumer
foods  and  markets  its  packaged food  products  primarily
through   its   own   sales  organizations,   supported   by
advertising and other promotional activities.  Such products
are primarily distributed directly to retail food chains, co-
operatives, membership stores and wholesalers.  Certain food
products, such as yogurt and some food service products, are
sold through distributors and brokers.

   The packaged consumer foods market is highly competitive,
with  numerous competitors of varying sizes.  The  principal
methods of competition include product quality, advertising,
promotion  and price.  In most of its consumer foods  lines,
described below, General Mills competes not only with  other
widely  advertised branded products, but also  with  generic
products  and  private label products, which  are  generally
distributed at lower prices.

   Cereals.    General Mills produces and sells a number  of
ready-to-eat  cereals, including such brands  as:  CHEERIOS,
HONEY  NUT  CHEERIOS,  APPLE CINNAMON CHEERIOS,  MULTI-GRAIN
CHEERIOS, WHEATIES, WHEATIES HONEY GOLD, LUCKY CHARMS,  CORN
TOTAL,  WHEAT TOTAL, TRIX, GOLDEN GRAHAMS, KIX, BERRY  BERRY
KIX,  FIBER  ONE,  COCOA PUFFS, CRISPY  WHEATS  'N  RAISINS,
CINNAMON  TOAST  CRUNCH, CLUSTERS, RAISIN  NUT  BRAN,  TOTAL
RAISIN  BRAN, OATMEAL CRISP, TRIPLES and BASIC 4.  In fiscal
1995, the Company introduced REESE'S PEANUT BUTTER PUFFS and
SUN CRUNCHERS.

   Desserts, Flour and Baking Mixes.    General Mills  makes
and  sells  a line of dessert mixes under the BETTY  CROCKER
trademark,  including SUPERMOIST layer cakes, CREAMY  DELUXE
and   WHIPPED  DELUXE  ready-to-spread  frostings,   SUPREME
BROWNIE  MIX,  SUPREME  DESSERT BARS, muffin  mixes,  CREAMY
CHILLED  DESSERTS  and  a new line, SWEET  REWARDS  fat-free
snack  cake mixes.  The Company markets a variety of  baking
mixes  under the BISQUICK trademark, sells pouch mixes under
the GOLD MEDAL name and produces family flour under the GOLD
MEDAL brand, introduced in 1880, and regional brands such as
LA  PINA, ROBIN HOOD and RED BAND.  The Company also engages
in   grain  merchandising,  produces  ingredient  flour  for
internal requirements and sells flour to bakery, foodservice
and manufacturing markets.

    Dinner   and   Side  Dish  Products.     General   Mills
manufactures  a  line of BETTY CROCKER dry  packaged  dinner
mixes  under the HAMBURGER HELPER, TUNA HELPER, and  SKILLET
CHICKEN  HELPER  trademarks, and in  June,  1995  introduced
DINNER   SENSATIONS,  a  high  value-added  packaged  dinner
product.   Also  under  the  BETTY  CROCKER  trademark,  the
Company  sells  POTATO BUDS instant mashed potatoes,  POTATO
SHAKERS  flavorings  and other potato  and  pasta  specialty
mixes,  such as SUDDENLY SALAD and BETTY CROCKER  au  gratin
and  scalloped  potatoes.  The Company  also  sells  BAC*O'S
garnish and salad topping.

SECRET  and  HBO microwave popcorn; a line of  grain  snacks

marketed  under the name BUGLES.  The Company also  produces
and  sells  a  line  of single-serving  fruit  juice  drinks
marketed  under the SQUEEZIT trademark and SQUEEZIT  100,  a
100% juice beverage.

   Yogurt Products.    Yoplait USA manufactures and sells  a

channels  and hardpack frozen yogurt and novelties  under  a
licensing   arrangement.   The  Colombo   yogurt   business,
acquired in December 1993, manufactures and sells a  variety
of   refrigerated  cup  yogurt,  soft  frozen  yogurt,   and
superpremium  hardpack  frozen  yogurt  products  under  the
COLOMBO brand name.

Inc.   manufactures  and  sells  food  products  in  Canada,
including BIG G ready-to-eat cereals, BETTY CROCKER dessert,
baking  and  packaged dinner mixes and snacks.  The  Company
also  has an interest in a Latin American flour milling  and
food  operation, licenses food products for  manufacture  in
Europe  and the Asia/Pacific region, and exports  flour  and
packaged products throughout the world.

    International  Dessert  Partners  L.L.C.  ("IDP"),   the
Company's  joint venture with CPC International  Inc.,  will
manufacture  and  sell baking mixes and  desserts  in  Latin
America under a joint venture agreement executed in December
1994.   The Company has a 50% equity interest in  IDP.   See
Note Four to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing  on
page 21 of the Company's 1995 Annual Report to Stockholders,
incorporated herein by reference.

   Cereal  Partners Worldwide ("CPW"), the  Company's  joint
venture with Nestle, S.A. through various entities, competes

equity  interest  in  SVE.  See Note  Four  to  Consolidated
Financial  Statements appearing on page 21 of the  Company's
1995  Annual Report to Stockholders, incorporated herein  by
reference.

   Foodservice.    The Foodservice division markets  General
Mills  branded  baking  mixes, cereals,  snacks  and  custom
products  to  the  commercial  and  non-commercial  sectors,
including airlines, schools, restaurants and food management
companies.


General
   Trademarks  and  Patents.   The  Company's  products  are
marketed  and  businesses  operated  under  trademarks   and
service   marks  owned  by  or  licensed  to  the   Company.
Trademarks  and  service marks are vital  to  the  Company's
business.  The most significant trademarks and service marks
of  the  Company  are  contained  in  the  business  segment
discussions above.

   The  Company considers that, taken as a whole, the rights
under  its various patents, which expire from time to  time,
are  a valuable asset, but the Company does not believe that
its  businesses  are materially dependent  upon  any  single
patent  or  group  of related patents.   Outside  its  joint
venture  activities, the Company's activities under licenses
or other franchises or concessions are not material.

   Raw Materials and Supplies.   The principal raw materials
used  by  General  Mills are cereal grains,  sugar,  fruits,
other agricultural products, vegetable oils, and plastic and
paper  for packaging materials.  Although General Mills  has
some long-term contracts, the bulk of such raw materials are
purchased on the open market.  Although prices of  most  raw
materials will probably increase over the long term, General
Mills  believes that it will be able to obtain  an  adequate
supply  of  such  raw  materials.   Occasionally  and  where
possible,   General   Mills  makes  advance   purchases   of
commodities significant to its business in order  to  ensure
continuity  of  operations.  The Company's objective  is  to
procure  ingredients  meeting  both  the  Company's  quality
standards and its production needs at the lowest total costs
to  the  Company.  The Company's strategy is  to  buy  these
ingredients  at  price levels which allow a targeted  profit
margin.   Since ingredients generally represent the  largest
variable  cost in manufacturing the Company's  products,  to
the  extent possible, the Company hedges the risk associated
with  adverse  price movements of grains and vegetable  oils
using  exchange-traded futures and options and forward  cash
contracts.   These tools enable the Company  to  manage  the
related  commodity  price risk over  periods  of  time  that
exceed the period of time in which the physical commodity is
available.   Sugar is not hedged since there  is  no  viable
derivative   market   that  meets   the   Company's   needs.
Accordingly, the Company uses hedging to mitigate the  risks
associated with adverse price movements and not to speculate
in  the  marketplace.  See also Note Seven  to  Consolidated
Financial  Statements appearing on page 22 of the  Company's
1995  Annual Report to Stockholders, incorporated herein  by
reference.

   Capital  Expenditures.   During the  three  fiscal  years
ended May 28, 1995, General Mills expended $687 million  for
capital  expenditures, not including the  cost  of  acquired
companies.  The Company expects to spend approximately  $170
million for such purposes in fiscal 1996.

    Research  and  Development.    The  main  research   and
development  facilities are located at the James  Ford  Bell
Technical  Center  in Golden Valley (suburban  Minneapolis),
Minnesota.  With a staff of approximately 750, the Center is
responsible  for most of the food research for the  Company.
Approximately one-half of the staff hold degrees in  various
chemical, biological and engineering sciences.  Research and
development expenditures (all Company-sponsored) amounted to
$59.8  million in fiscal 1995, $59.1 million in fiscal  1994
and  $55.7 million in fiscal 1993.  General Mills'  research
and   development  resources  are  focused  on  new  product
development,   product  improvement,  process   design   and
improvement,  packaging  and  exploratory  research  in  new
business areas.

    Employees.    At  May  28,  1995,  General   Mills   had
approximately 9,900 employees.

   Environmental Matters.   As of June 30, 1995, the Company
has  received  notices  advising it  that  there  have  been
releases  or threatened releases of hazardous substances  or
wastes  at  11  sites,  and alleging  that  the  Company  is
potentially  responsible for cleaning up those sites  and/or
paying certain costs in connection with those sites.   These
matters   involve  several  different  procedural  contexts,
including  litigation initiated by governmental  authorities
and/or private parties, administrative proceedings commenced
by   regulatory  agencies,  and  demand  letters  issued  by
regulatory  agencies  and/or private parties.   The  Company
recognizes that its potential exposure with respect  to  any
of  these  sites may be joint and several, but has concluded
that  its probable aggregate exposure is not material.  This
conclusion is based upon, among other things, the  Company's
payments  and/or  accruals with respect to  each  site;  the
number, ranking, and financial strength of other potentially
responsible  parties identified at each of  the  sites;  the
status  of  the  proceedings, including  various  settlement
agreements, consent decrees or court orders; allocations  of
volumetric  waste contributions and allocations of  relative
responsibility   among   potentially   responsible   parties
developed  by  regulatory agencies and by  private  parties;
remediation   cost   estimates  prepared   by   governmental
authorities  or  private  technical  consultants;  and   the
Company's historical experience in negotiating and  settling
disputes with respect to similar sites.

   Based  on current facts and circumstances, General  Mills
believes  that neither the results of these proceedings  nor
its  compliance  in  general  with  environmental  laws   or
regulations  will  have a material effect upon  the  capital
expenditures,  earnings  or  competitive  position  of   the
Company.

   Segment  Information.    Reporting financial  information
relating   to  industry  segments  of  General   Mills   was
discontinued as of May 28, 1995 with the distribution of the
restaurant business.  For a description of the distribution,
see  Note Two to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing
on   page  20  of  the  Company's  1995  Annual  Report   to
Stockholders, incorporated herein by reference.   Geographic
financial   information  is  found  in  Note   Eighteen   to
Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on  page  29  of
the   Company's   1995   Annual  Report   to   Stockholders,
incorporated herein by reference.

                      GENERAL MILLS, INC.
        STATEMENT OF DETERMINATION OF COMMON SHARES AND
                   COMMON SHARE EQUIVALENTS
                         (in millions)
                               
                               
                                            Weighted average number of
                                          common shares and common share
                                         equivalents assumed outstanding
                                            For the Fiscal Years Ended
                                    May 28, 1995   May 29, 1994   May 30, 1993

Weighted average number of common 
 shares outstanding, excluding 
 common stock held in treasury (a)      158.0          159.1           163.1

Common share equivalents resulting 
 from the assumed exercise of certain 
 stock options (b)                        2.1 *          2.4 *           3.3 *

Total common shares and common share 
 equivalents                            160.1          161.5           166.4


Notes:

(a)  Computed as the weighted average net shares outstanding on stock-exchange  
     trading days.
(b)  Common share equivalents are computed by the "treasury stock" method.  
     This method first determines the number of shares issuable under stock
     options that had an option price below the average market price for the 
     period, and then deducts the number of shares that could have been 
     repurchased with the proceeds of options exercised.


* Common  share equivalents are not material.  As  a  result,
  earnings  per  share have been computed using the  weighted
  average  of  common  shares outstanding of  158.0  million,
  159.1  million and 163.1 million for fiscal 1995, 1994  and
  1993, respectively.

                      GENERAL MILLS, INC.
              RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES
                       
                                       Fiscal Year Ended

Ratio of Earnings to 
 Fixed Charges. . . . .    4.10      6.18      8.62      9.28      8.06
    
    For  purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed     
charges,  earnings  represent pretax income  from  continuing
operations  plus fixed charges (net of capitalized interest).
Fixed   charges  represent  interest  (whether  expensed   or
capitalized)    and   one-third   (the   proportion    deemed
representative of the interest factor) of rents of continuing
operations.
