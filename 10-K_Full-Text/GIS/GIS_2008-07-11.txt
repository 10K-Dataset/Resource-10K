Business

COMPANY
    OVERVIEW

General Mills, Inc. is a leading global manufacturer and
    marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores.

    of this report unless the context indicates otherwise.

Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a
    glossary in Item 8 of this report.

TRADEMARKS
    AND PATENTS

Our products are marketed under trademarks and service marks
    that are owned by or licensed to us. The most significant
    trademarks and service marks used in our businesses are set
    forth in

italics

in this report. Some of the important
    trademarks used in our global operations include:



Trademarks are vital to our businesses. To protect our ownership
    and rights, we register our trademarks with the Patent and
    Trademark Office in the United States, and we file similar
    registrations in foreign jurisdictions. Trademark registrations
    in the United States are generally for a term of 10 years,
    renewable every 10 years as long as the trademark is used
    in the regular course of business.

    trademarks that have been licensed from others, including:

•

•

We license all of our cereal trademarks to Cereal Partners
    Worldwide (CPW), our joint venture with Nestlé S.A.
    (Nestlé). Nestlé similarly licenses certain of its
    trademarks to CPW, including the

Nestlé

and

Uncle
    Tobys

trademarks. We also license our

Green Giant

trademark to a third party for use in connection with its
    sale of fresh produce in the United States. We own the

Häagen-Dazs

trademark and have the right to use the
    trademark outside of the United States and Canada. Nestlé
    has an exclusive royalty-free license to use the

Häagen-Dazs

trademark in the United States and
    Canada on ice cream and other frozen dessert products. We also
    license this trademark to our joint ventures in Japan and Korea.
    The J. M. Smucker Company holds an exclusive royalty-free
    license to use the

Pillsbury

brand and the

Pillsbury
    Doughboy

character in the dessert mix and baking mix
    categories in the United States and under limited circumstances
    in Canada and Mexico.

Given our focus on developing and marketing innovative,
    proprietary products, we consider the collective rights under
    our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable
    asset, but we do not believe that our businesses are materially
    dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.

RAW
    MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES

The principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat, oats,
    and corn), sugar, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, meats,
    vegetable oils, and other agricultural products. We also use
    substantial quantities of carton board, corrugated and plastic
    packaging materials, operating supplies, and energy. Most of
    these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are
    purchased from suppliers in the United States. In our
    international operations, inputs that are not locally available
    in adequate supply may be imported from other countries. The
    cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government
    policy and regulation, weather conditions, or other unforeseen
    circumstances. We have some long-term fixed price contracts, but
    the majority of our inputs are purchased on the open market. We
    believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of
    needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible, we make advance
    purchases of items significant to our business in order to
    ensure continuity of operations. Our objective is to procure
    materials meeting both our quality standards and our production
    needs at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin. Since
    these inputs generally represent the largest variable cost in
    manufacturing our products, to the extent possible, we often
    hedge the risk associated with adverse price movements for some
    inputs using a variety of risk management strategies. We also
    have a grain merchandising operation that provides us efficient
    access to, and more informed knowledge of, various commodity
    markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds
    physical inventories that are carried at fair market value and
    uses derivatives to hedge its net inventory position and
    minimize its market exposures.

RESEARCH
    AND DEVELOPMENT

Our principal research and development facilities are located in
    Minneapolis, Minnesota. Our research and development resources
    are focused on new product development, product improvement,
    process design and improvement, packaging, and



exploratory research in new business areas. Research and
    development expenditures were $204.7 million in fiscal
    2008, $191.1 million in fiscal 2007, and
    $178.4 million in fiscal 2006.

FINANCIAL
    INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

We review the financial results of our business under three
    operating segments – U.S. Retail, International,
    and Bakeries and Foodservice. See Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    (MD&A) in Item 7 of this report for a description of
    our segments. For financial information by segment and
    geographic area, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this report.

JOINT
    VENTURES

In addition to our consolidated operations, we participate in
    several joint ventures, including CPW and

Häagen-Dazs

ice cream joint ventures in Japan and Korea.

CUSTOMERS

Our primary customers are grocery stores, mass merchandisers,
    membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and
    discount chains, commercial and noncommercial foodservice
    distributors and operators, restaurants, and convenience stores.
    We generally sell to these customers through our direct sales
    force. We use broker and distribution arrangements for certain
    products or to serve certain types of customers.

During fiscal 2008, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates
    (Wal-Mart), accounted for 19 percent of our consolidated
    net sales and 27 percent of our net sales in the
    U.S. Retail segment. No other customer accounted for
    10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. Wal-Mart
    also represented 5 percent of our net sales in the
    International segment and 5 percent of our net sales in the
    Bakeries and Foodservice segment. As of May 25, 2008,
    Wal-Mart accounted for 23 percent of our U.S. Retail
    receivables, 4 percent of our International receivables,
    and 2 percent of our Bakeries and Foodservice receivables.
    The 5 largest customers in our U.S. Retail segment
    accounted for 57 percent of its fiscal 2008 net sales,
    the 5 largest customers in our International segment accounted
    for 26 percent of its fiscal 2008 net sales, and the 5
    largest customers in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment
    accounted for 39 percent of its fiscal 2008 net sales.
    For further information on our customer credit and product
    return practices please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

COMPETITION

The consumer foods industry is highly competitive, with numerous
    manufacturers of varying sizes in the United States and
    throughout the world. The food categories in which we
    participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in
    these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and
    other resources. Competition in our product categories is based
    on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition
    and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity,
    and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences.
    Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments
    include effective customer relationships, superior product
    quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product
    innovation, an efficient supply chain, and price. In most
    product categories, we compete not only with other widely
    advertised branded products, but also with generic and private
    label products that are generally sold at lower prices.
    Internationally, we compete with both multi-national and local
    manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of
    competitors.

SEASONALITY

In general, demand for our products is evenly balanced
    throughout the year. However, within our U.S. Retail
    segment demand for refrigerated dough, frozen baked goods, and
    baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter.
    Demand for

Progresso

soup and

Green Giant

canned
    and frozen vegetables is higher during the fall and winter
    months. Internationally, demand for

Häagen-Dazs

ice
    cream is higher during the summer months and demand for baking
    mix and dough products increases during winter months. Due to
    the offsetting impact of these demand trends, as well as the
    different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres, our
    International segment net sales are generally evenly balanced
    throughout the year.

BACKLOG

Orders are generally filled within a few days of receipt and are
    subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The
    backlog of any unfilled orders as of May 25, 2008, was not
    material.



WORKING
    CAPITAL

A description of our working capital is included in the
    Liquidity section of MD&A in Item 7 of this report.
    Our product return practices are described in Note 2 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

EMPLOYEES

As of May 25, 2008, we had approximately 29,500 full- and
    part-time employees.

FOOD
    QUALITY AND SAFETY REGULATION

The manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly
    regulated. In the United States, our activities are subject to
    regulation by various federal government agencies, including the
    Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Federal
    Trade Commission, Department of Commerce, and Environmental
    Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies.
    Our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of
    the United States.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

As of May 25, 2008, we were involved with four active
    cleanup sites associated with the alleged or threatened release
    of hazardous substances or wastes located in: Minneapolis,
    Minnesota; Sauget, Illinois; Moonachie, New Jersey; and
    Doolittle, Missouri. These matters involve several different
    actions, including administrative proceedings commenced by
    regulatory agencies and demand letters by regulatory agencies
    and private parties.

We recognize that our potential exposure with respect to any of
    these sites may be joint and several, but have concluded that
    our probable aggregate exposure is not material to our
    consolidated financial position or cash flows from operations.
    This conclusion is based upon, among other things: our payments
    and accruals with respect to each site; the number, ranking and
    financial strength of other potentially responsible parties; the
    status of the proceedings, including various settlement
    agreements, consent decrees, or court orders; allocations of
    volumetric waste contributions and allocations of relative
    responsibility among potentially responsible parties developed
    by regulatory agencies and by private parties; remediation cost
    estimates prepared by governmental authorities or private
    technical consultants; and our historical experience in
    negotiating and settling disputes with respect to similar sites.

Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water
    Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and the
    Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and all
    similar state, local, and foreign environmental laws and
    regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Based on current facts and circumstances, we believe that
    neither the results of our environmental proceedings nor our
    compliance in general with environmental laws or regulations
    will have a material adverse effect upon our capital
    expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

ITEM 1A

Risk
    Factors

Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any
    of the risks described below could materially adversely affect
    our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The
    food categories in which we participate are very competitive,
    and if we are not able to compete effectively, our results of
    operations could be adversely affected.

The food categories in which we participate are very
    competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all
    have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In
    most product categories, we compete not only with other widely
    advertised branded products, but also with generic and private
    label products that are generally sold at lower prices.
    Competition in our product categories is based on product
    innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and
    loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, and
    the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our
    large competitors were to decrease their pricing or were to
    increase their promotional spending, we could choose to do the
    same, which could adversely affect our margins and
    profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and
    market share could be adversely affected. Our market share and
    revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not
    successful in introducing innovative products in response to
    changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our
    competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity
    by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be
    unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private
    label products.

We
    may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a
    consolidating retail environment.

The 5 largest customers in our U.S. Retail segment
    accounted for 57 percent of its fiscal 2008 net sales,
    the 5 largest customers in our International segment accounted
    for 26 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2008, and the 5
    largest customers in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment
    accounted for 39 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2008.
    The loss of any large customer for an extended length of time
    could adversely affect our sales and profits. There has been
    significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry in
    recent years and we believe that this trend is likely to
    continue. As the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate
    and mass market retailers become larger, our large retail
    customers may seek to use their position to improve their
    profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing,
    increased emphasis on generic, private label and other economy
    brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to
    use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation,
    knowledge of consumers’ needs, and category leadership
    positions to respond to these demands, our profitability or
    volume growth could be negatively impacted.

Price
    changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials,
    packaging, and energy may adversely affect our
    profitability.

The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that
    experience price volatility caused by external conditions such
    as weather and product scarcity, limited sources of supply,



commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, and
    changes in governmental agricultural and energy programs.
    Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in
    raw material, packaging, and energy costs. If we are unable to
    increase productivity to offset these increased costs or
    increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and
    profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in
    commodity prices, and the hedging procedures that we do use may
    not always work as we intend.

Volatility
    in the market value of derivatives we use to hedge exposures to
    fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our
    gross margins and net earnings.

We utilize derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our
    principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats,
    wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), non-fat dry milk,
    natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these
    derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in
    volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains
    and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated
    Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items in our
    segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input
    in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses
    are reclassified to segment operating profit. We also record our
    grain inventories at fair value. We may experience volatile
    earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.

If
    we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could
    suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in
    which we operate.

Our future success and earnings growth depends in part on our
    ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our
    products in highly competitive markets. Gaining additional
    efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to
    reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating
    redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely
    affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position.
    Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of
    manufacturing facilities and production lines. Such
    manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of
    production, which may negatively impact product volume and
    margins.

Disruption
    of our supply chain could adversely affect our
    business.

Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our
    success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our
    manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather,
    natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes, import
    restrictions, or other factors could impair our ability to
    manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps
    to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events,
    or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly
    when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location,
    could adversely affect our business and results of operations,
    as well as require additional resources to restore our supply
    chain.

Concerns
    with the safety and quality of food products could cause
    consumers to avoid certain food products or
    ingredients.

We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal
    markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain
    food products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these
    types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage
    consumers from buying our products or cause production and
    delivery disruptions.

If
    our food products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled,
    we might need to recall those items and may experience product
    liability claims if consumers are injured.

We may need to recall some of our products if they become
    adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product
    recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a
    recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due
    to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could
    also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment
    against us. A significant product recall or product liability
    case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our
    reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our food
    products, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    business results and the value of our brands.



We
    may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and
    trends, which may result in decreased demand for our
    products.

Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the
    tastes and eating habits of consumers and to offer products that
    appeal to their preferences. Consumer preferences change from
    time to time and can be affected by a number of different
    trends. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react to these
    changes and trends, or to introduce new and improved products on
    a timely basis, could result in reduced demand for our products,
    which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to
    suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by
    consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients
    such as trans fats, sugar, processed wheat, or other product
    ingredients or attributes.

We
    may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are
    in faster growing and more profitable categories.

The food industry’s growth potential is constrained by
    population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to
    grow our business faster than populations are growing in the
    markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to
    enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in
    faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future
    results will also depend on our ability to increase market share
    in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in
    developing innovative products for new and existing categories,
    our growth may slow, which could adversely affect our
    profitability.

Customer
    demand for our products may be limited in future periods as a
    result of increased purchases in response to promotional
    activity.

Our unit volume in the last week of each quarter can be higher
    than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter in
    certain circumstances. In comparison to the average daily
    shipments in the first 12 weeks of a quarter, the final
    week of each quarter may have as much as two to four days’
    worth of incremental shipments (based on a

five-day

week), reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of
    the quarter. This increased activity includes promotions to
    assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to
    support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand
    early in the next quarter, as well as promotions intended to
    help achieve interim unit volume targets. If, due to quarter-end
    promotions or other reasons, our customers purchase more product
    in any reporting period than end-consumer demand will require in
    future periods, our sales level in future reporting periods
    could be adversely affected.

Economic
    downturns could limit consumer demand for our
    products.

The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in
    part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic
    uncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label,
    and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases
    altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a
    reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our
    product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result
    of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable
    to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers
    may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from
    home at customers that purchase products from our Bakeries and
    Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse
    effect on our results of operations.

Our
    international operations are subject to political and economic
    risks.

In fiscal 2008, 19 percent of our consolidated net sales
    was generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly
    subject to a number of risks relating to doing business
    internationally, any of which could significantly harm our
    business. These risks include:

• political and economic instability;

• exchange controls and currency exchange rates;

• foreign tax treaties and policies; and

• restriction on the transfer of funds to and from
    foreign countries.

Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated
    basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
    These fluctuations could cause material variations in our
    results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the
    Australian dollar, British pound



sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen,
    and Mexican peso. From time to time, we enter into agreements
    that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to
    currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective
    in significantly reducing our exposure.

New
    regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect
    our business.

Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety
    of federal, state, local, and foreign agencies. Changes in laws
    or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on
    us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our
    actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely
    affected. In addition, we advertise our products and could be
    the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive
    advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and
    regulations and of new laws or regulations restricting our right
    to advertise products.

We
    have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit
    financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect
    our ability to pay dividends.

As of May 25, 2008, we had total debt and minority
    interests of $7.2 billion. The agreements under which we
    have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring
    additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of
    indebtedness may limit our:

• ability to obtain additional financing for working
    capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes,
    particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by
    rating organizations were revised downward; and

• flexibility to adjust to changing business and
    market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn
    in general economic conditions.

There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in
    our debt instruments and minority interests. If we fail to
    comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness
    (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable
    prior to its stated maturity, and our ability to obtain
    additional or alternative financing may also be adversely
    affected.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our
    debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and
    financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing
    economic conditions and to financial, business, and other
    factors beyond our control.

Volatility
    in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors or
    changes in our employee base could substantially increase our
    defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and
    postemployment benefit costs.

We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in
    the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations,
    including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare,
    severance, directors’ life, and other postemployment
    benefit plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are
    funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified
    portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in
    interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early
    retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of
    plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit
    pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plans
    and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future
    funding requirements of the plans. Although the aggregate fair
    value of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and
    postemployment benefit plan assets exceeded the aggregate
    defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and
    postemployment benefit obligations as of May 25, 2008, a
    significant increase in our obligations or future funding
    requirements could have a negative impact on our results of
    operations and cash flows from operations.

Our
    business operations could be disrupted if our information
    technology systems fail to perform adequately.

The efficient operation of our business depends on our
    information technology systems. We rely on our information
    technology systems to effectively manage our business data,
    communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and
    other business processes. The failure of our information
    technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our
    business and could result in transaction errors, processing
    inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our
    business and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our
    information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or
    interruption from



circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural
    disasters, systems failures, security breaches, and viruses. Any
    such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect
    on our business.

If
    other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) are unable to
    contribute to remediation costs at certain contaminated sites,
    our costs for remediation could be material.

We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign
    environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Under
    certain of these laws, namely the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and its state
    counterparts, liability for investigation and remediation of
    hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerly owned
    or operated facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites is
    joint and several. We currently are involved in active
    remediation efforts at certain sites where we have been named a
    PRP. If other PRPs at these sites are unable to contribute to
    remediation costs, we could be held responsible for their
    portion of the remediation costs, and those costs could be
    material. We cannot assure that our costs in relation to these
    environmental matters or compliance with environmental laws in
    general will not exceed our reserves or otherwise have an
    adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

A
    change in the assumptions used to value our reporting units or
    our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect
    our consolidated results of operations and net worth.

Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for
    impairment annually and whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We
    compare the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting
    unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. If the
    fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit is less than
    the net assets including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our
    estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted
    cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are
    determined using inputs from our annual long-range planning
    process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity
    growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. While
    we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired,
    materially different assumptions regarding the future
    performance of our businesses could result in significant
    impairment losses.

We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily
    intangible assets associated with the

Pillsbury

,

Totino’s

,

Progresso

,

Green Giant

,

Old El Paso

,

Häagen-Dazs,

and

Uncle
    Tobys

brands, to determine if they are finite or
    indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life
    requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the
    future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other
    economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known
    technological advances, legislative action that results in an
    uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected
    changes in distribution channels), the level of required
    maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other
    related groups of assets.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for
    impairment annually and whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is
    based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including:
    projected revenues from our annual long-range plan; assumed
    royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the
    brands; and a discount rate. While we currently believe that the
    fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its
    carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will
    contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different
    assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses
    could result in significant impairment losses and amortization
    expense.

Resolution
    of uncertain income tax matters could adversely affect our
    results of operations or cash flows from operations.

Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax
    planning opportunities available to us in the various
    jurisdictions in which we operate. Management judgment is
    involved in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating
    the ultimate resolution of any uncertain tax positions. We are
    periodically under examination or engaged in a tax controversy.
    We establish reserves in a variety of taxing jurisdictions when,
    despite our belief that our tax return positions are
    supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged
    and may need to be



revised. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and
    circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Our
    effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve
    provisions and changes to those reserves. We also record
    interest on these reserves at the appropriate statutory interest
    rate. These interest charges are also included in our effective
    tax rate. Reserve adjustments for individual issues have
    generally not exceeded 1 percent of earnings before income
    taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures annually.

During fiscal 2008, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded
    field examinations for our 2002 and 2003 federal tax years.
    These examinations included review of our determinations of cost
    basis, capital losses, and the depreciation of tangible assets
    and amortization of intangible assets arising from our
    acquisition of Pillsbury and the sale of minority interests in
    our General Mills Cereals, LLC subsidiary. The IRS has proposed
    adjustments related to a majority of the tax benefits associated
    with these items. We believe we have meritorious defenses and
    intend to vigorously defend our positions. Our potential
    liability for this matter is significant and, notwithstanding
    our reserves against this potential liability, an unfavorable
    resolution could have a material adverse impact on our results
    of operations or cash flows from operations.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are the subject of various pending or threatened legal
    actions in the ordinary course of our business. All such matters
    are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not
    predictable with assurance. In our opinion, there were no claims
    or litigation pending as of May 25, 2008, that were
    reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations. See

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. On
    June 27, 2008, there were approximately 32,700 record
    holders of our common stock. Information regarding the market
    prices for our common stock and dividend payments for the two
    most recent fiscal years is set forth in Note 18 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

On May 20, 2008, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of
    Merger to acquire Humm Foods, Inc. The transaction closed on
    June 11, 2008. At the closing, we issued
    892,535 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of
    Humm Foods, Inc. as consideration for the merger. Based on
    representations and warranties made by the selling shareholders,
    we issued our common stock in a transaction exempt from the
    registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the
    Securities Act of 1933 by virtue of Section 4(2).

Fiscal 2004 was a 53-week year; all other fiscal years were
    52 weeks.

In fiscal 2007, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (SFAS) No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit
    Plans an amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)”,
    resulting in an after-tax reduction to stockholders’ equity
    of $440.4 million, and SFAS No. 123R, “Share
    Based Payment”, resulting in a decrease to fiscal
    2007 net earnings of $42.9 million, and a decrease to
    fiscal 2007 cash flows from operations and corresponding
    decrease to cash flows used by financing activities of
    $73.1 million. See Notes 2 and 13 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

ITEM 7

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

EXECUTIVE
    OVERVIEW

We are a global consumer foods company. We develop distinctive
    food products and market these value-added products under unique
    brand names. We work continuously to improve our established
    brands and to create new products that meet consumers’
    evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity
    of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing
    and innovative merchandising. We believe our brand-building
    strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share
    positions in markets around the globe.

Our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns
    for our stockholders over the long term. We believe that
    increases in net sales, segment operating profits, earnings per
    share (EPS), and return on average total capital are the key
    measures of financial performance for our businesses. See the
    “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for our
    discussion of segment operating profit and return on average
    total capital, which are not defined by generally accepted
    accounting principles (GAAP). Our objectives are to consistently
    deliver:

• low single-digit annual growth in net sales;

• mid single-digit annual growth in total segment
    operating profit;

• high single-digit annual growth in EPS; and

• on average, at least a 50 basis point annual
    increase in return on average total capital.

We believe that this financial performance, coupled with an
    attractive dividend yield, should result in long-term value
    creation for stockholders. We also return a substantial amount
    of cash annually to stockholders through share repurchases.

For the fiscal year ended May 25, 2008, our net sales grew
    9.7 percent, total segment operating profit grew
    6.4 percent, diluted EPS grew 16.7 percent, and our
    return on average total capital improved by 100 basis
    points. These results met or exceeded our long-term targets.
    Diluted EPS for fiscal 2008 includes a $0.10 net gain from
    mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and a
    $0.09 benefit associated with a favorable court decision on a
    discrete tax matter. Net cash provided by operations totaled
    $1.7 billion in fiscal 2008, enabling us to increase our
    annual dividend payments per share by 9.0 percent from
    fiscal 2007 and continue returning cash to stockholders through
    share repurchases, which totaled $1,384.6 million in fiscal
    2008. We also made significant capital investments totaling
    $522.0 million in fiscal 2008, an increase of
    13.4 percent from fiscal 2007, to support future growth and
    productivity.

We achieved each of our four key operating objectives for fiscal
    2008:

• We generated broad-based growth in net sales across
    our businesses. All of our U.S. Retail divisions,
    International geographic regions, and Bakeries and Foodservice
    customer segments posted net sales gains in fiscal 2008. We
    generated 2.9 points of growth from volume, generated 5.3 points
    of growth from net price realization and product mix, and
    realized 1.5 points of foreign currency exchange benefit.

• Our cost savings initiatives helped to partially
    offset input cost inflation in fiscal 2008. We took steps to
    manage raw material costs, especially with significant commodity
    price increases in fiscal 2008, and we initiated several
    restructuring actions to rationalize and simplify our product
    portfolio, allowing us to focus on higher margin products.

• We invested a significant amount in media and other
    brand-building marketing programs, which contributed to sales
    growth across our businesses.

• We also recorded increases in EPS well above our
    target, even excluding the effects of non-cash, mark-to-market
    gains and a discrete tax item.

Details of our financial results are provided in the
    “Fiscal 2008 Consolidated Results of Operations”
    section below.

In fiscal 2009, input cost inflation will remain a challenge for
    us. We plan to offset a significant portion of this cost
    inflation with our holistic margin management (HMM) efforts,
    which include cost-savings initiatives, marketing spending
    efficiencies, and profitable sales mix strategies. We have also
    raised prices on a number of our product lines. We believe our
    HMM efforts help us keep our price increases moderate and expand
    our margins over the long term. In addition, our HMM savings
    generate resources for increased advertising and other
    brand-building consumer marketing initiatives. Our plans call
    for a high single digit increase in consumer marketing support
    in fiscal 2009. We believe this support is a key factor in
    generating net sales growth, as we believe it builds consumer
    loyalty, increases our market share, and defends against
    private-label offerings.

In addition to protecting and expanding our margins over time,
    and investing in brand-building marketing initiatives, our key
    operating objectives for fiscal 2009 include plans for
    introducing new products and extending existing brands to new
    markets. We



are exploring innovative ways to partner with customers
    including traditional food retailers, new retail formats, and
    various away-from-home channels. We will continue to grow our
    business in international markets, focusing on our core
    platforms of super-premium ice cream, world cuisine, and healthy
    snacking.

Our plans also call for $550 million of expenditures for
    capital projects and a significant amount of cash returned to
    stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our
    long-term objective is to reduce outstanding shares by a
    net 2 percent per year. We intend to continue
    repurchasing shares in fiscal 2009, with a goal of reducing
    average diluted shares outstanding a net 1 percent. On
    June 23, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a dividend
    increase to an annual rate of $1.72 per share. This represents a
    9 percent compound annual growth rate in dividends from
    fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2009.

Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a
    glossary in Item 8 of this report.

FISCAL
    2008 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For fiscal 2008, we reported diluted EPS of $3.71, up
    16.7 percent from $3.18 per share earned in fiscal 2007.
    Earnings after tax were $1,294.7 million in fiscal 2008, up
    13.2 percent from $1,143.9 million in fiscal 2007.

The components of net sales growth are shown in the following
    table:

Net sales

for fiscal 2008 grew 9.7 percent to
    $13.7 billion, driven by 2.9 percentage points from
    volume growth, mainly in our U.S. Retail and International
    segments, and 5.3 percentage points of growth from net
    price realization and product mix across many of our businesses.
    In addition, foreign currency exchange effects added
    1.5 percentage points of growth. During the second quarter
    of fiscal 2008, we voluntarily recalled all pepperoni varieties
    of

Totino’s

and

Jeno’s

frozen pizza
    manufactured on or before October 30, 2007 due to potential
    contamination. We also voluntarily recalled one flavor of

Progresso

soup during the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
    The frozen pizza and soup recalls did not significantly impact
    our net sales for fiscal 2008.

Cost of sales

was up $823.2 million in fiscal 2008
    versus fiscal 2007. Cost of sales as a percent of net sales
    increased from 63.9 percent in fiscal 2007 to
    64.3 percent in fiscal 2008. Higher volume drove
    $206.9 million of this increase. Higher input costs and
    changes in mix increased cost of sales by $632.1 million.
    We recorded net mark-to-market gains of $59.6 million
    related to hedges on open commodity positions that will mitigate
    future input cost inflation, and a $2.6 million loss from
    the revaluation of certain grain inventories to market. We also
    recorded $18.5 million of charges to cost of sales,
    primarily accelerated depreciation on long-lived assets
    associated with previously announced restructuring actions. Our

La Salteña

pasta manufacturing plant in
    Argentina was destroyed by a fire resulting in a loss of
    $1.3 million, net of insurance proceeds, from the write off
    of inventory and property, plant, and equipment, and severance
    expense related to this event. Cost of sales for fiscal 2008
    also includes $21.4 million of costs, including product
    write offs, logistics, and other costs related to the voluntary
    recalls.

Gross margin

grew 8.6 percent in fiscal 2008 versus
    fiscal 2007, driven by higher volume, cost savings initiatives
    and net price realization. Gross margin as a percent of net
    sales declined 40 basis points from fiscal 2007 to fiscal
    2008. This primarily reflects declines in our Bakeries and
    Foodservice segment, where we took price increases designed to
    offset cost increases on a dollar basis, but gross margin as a
    percent of net sales declined.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses

increased by $235.7 million in fiscal 2008 versus
    fiscal 2007. The increase in SG&A expenses from fiscal 2007
    was largely the result of a 13.2 percent increase in media
    and other consumer marketing spending consistent with our
    brand-building strategy, $30.1 million more foreign
    exchange losses than a year ago, higher levels of compensation
    and benefits, a 7.1 percent increase in research and
    development expense supporting our innovation initiatives, and
    $9.2 million of costs associated with the remarketing of
    the Class A and

Series B-1

Interests in our subsidiary General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC).
    SG&A expense as a percent of net sales was essentially flat
    compared to fiscal 2007.

Net interest

for fiscal 2008 totaled $421.7 million,
    $4.8 million lower than fiscal 2007. Average
    interest-bearing instruments



increased $467.3 million leading to a $29.3 million
    increase in net interest, while average interest rates decreased
    50 basis points generating a $34.1 million decrease in
    net interest. Net interest includes preferred distributions paid
    on minority interests. The average rate on our total outstanding
    debt and minority interests was 5.8 percent in fiscal 2008
    compared to 6.3 percent in fiscal 2007.

Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs

totaled
    $21.0 million in fiscal 2008 as follows:

Expense (Income), In Millions

Closure of Poplar, Wisconsin plant

$

2.7

Closure and sale of Allentown, Pennsylvania frozen waffle plant

We approved a plan to transfer

Old El Paso

production from our Poplar, Wisconsin facility to other
    plants and to close the Poplar facility to improve capacity
    utilization and reduce costs. This action affects
    113 employees at the Poplar facility and resulted in a
    charge of $2.7 million consisting entirely of employee
    severance. Due to declining financial results, we decided to
    exit our frozen waffle product line (retail and foodservice) and
    to close our frozen waffle plant in Allentown, Pennsylvania,
    affecting 111 employees. We recorded a charge consisting of
    $3.5 million of employee severance and a $5.9 million
    non-cash impairment charge against long-lived assets at the
    plant. We also completed an analysis of the viability of our
    Bakeries and Foodservice frozen dough facility in Trenton,
    Ontario, and decided to close the facility, affecting
    470 employees. We recorded a charge consisting of
    $8.4 million for employee expenses and $2.5 million in
    charges for shutdown and decommissioning costs. We lease the
    Trenton plant under an agreement expiring in fiscal 2013. We
    expect to make limited use of the plant during fiscal 2009 while
    we evaluate sublease or lease termination options. These
    actions, including the anticipated timing of the disposition of
    the plants we will close, are expected to be completed by the
    end of the third quarter of fiscal 2009. We also restructured
    our production scheduling and discontinued our cake production
    line at our Chanhassen, Minnesota Bakeries and Foodservice
    plant. These actions affected 125 employees, and we
    recorded a $3.0 million charge for employee severance,
    partially offset by a $1.4 million gain from the sale of
    long-lived assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. This
    action is expected to be completed by the end of the first
    quarter of fiscal 2009. Finally, we recorded additional charges
    of $3.5 million primarily related to previously announced
    Bakeries and Foodservice segment restructuring actions including
    employee severance for 38 employees.

Collectively, the charges we expect to incur with respect to
    these fiscal 2008 restructuring actions total $65 million,
    of which $43.3 million has been recognized in fiscal 2008.
    This includes a $17.7 million non-cash charge related to
    accelerated depreciation on long-lived assets at our plant in
    Trenton, Ontario and $0.8 million of inventory write offs
    at our plants in Chanhassen, Minnesota and Allentown,
    Pennsylvania. The accelerated depreciation charge is recorded in
    cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in
    unallocated corporate items in our segment results.

Our consolidated

effective income tax rate

is influenced
    by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various
    jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective tax rate for
    fiscal 2008 was 34.4 percent compared to 34.3 percent
    for the same period of fiscal 2007. The 0.1 percentage
    point increase is the result of an increase in the state income
    tax rate due to more income in higher rate jurisdictions and
    lower foreign tax credits. These items were offset by a
    favorable U.S. Federal District Court decision on an
    uncertain tax matter that reduced our liability for uncertain
    tax positions and related accrued interest by
    $30.7 million. The IRS has appealed the District Court
    decision, and accordingly, its ultimate resolution is subject to
    change.

After-tax earnings from joint ventures

totaled
    $110.8 million in fiscal 2008, compared to
    $72.7 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, net sales for
    Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) grew 23.3 percent driven by
    higher volume, key new product introductions including

Oats & More

in the United Kingdom and

Nesquik Duo

across a number of regions, favorable foreign
    currency effects, and the benefit of a full year of sales from
    the Uncle Tobys acquisition, which closed in July 2006. Our
    fiscal 2008 after-tax earnings from joint ventures was benefited
    by $15.9 million for our share of a gain on the sale of a
    CPW property in the United Kingdom. Net sales for our
    Häagen-Dazs joint ventures in Asia increased
    15.7 percent in fiscal 2008 as a result of favorable



foreign exchange and introductory product shipments. During the
    third quarter of fiscal 2008, the 8th Continent soymilk
    business was sold. Our 50 percent share of the after-tax
    gain on the sale was $2.2 million. During fiscal 2008, we
    recognized $1.7 million of this gain in after-tax earnings
    from joint ventures. We will record an additional after-tax gain
    of up to $0.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010
    if certain conditions are satisfied.

Average diluted shares outstanding

decreased by
    13.3 million from fiscal 2007 due to our repurchase of
    23.9 million shares of stock during fiscal 2008, partially
    offset by the issuance of 14.3 million shares to settle a
    forward purchase contract with an affiliate of Lehman Brothers,
    Inc. (Lehman Brothers), the issuance of shares upon stock option
    exercises, the issuance of annual stock awards, and the vesting
    of restricted stock units.

FISCAL
    2008 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

Cash and cash equivalents

increased $243.9 million
    from fiscal 2007, as discussed in the “Liquidity”
    section below.

Receivables

increased $128.7 million from fiscal
    2007, mainly driven by higher international sales levels and
    foreign exchange translation. The allowance for doubtful
    accounts was unchanged from fiscal 2007.

Inventories

increased $193.4 million from fiscal
    2007 due to an increase in the prices and levels of grain
    inventories, as well as a higher level of finished goods. These
    increases were partially offset by an increase in the reserve
    for the excess of first in, first out (FIFO) inventory costs
    over last in, first out (LIFO) inventory costs of
    $47.7 million.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets

increased
    $67.5 million, as derivative and other receivables
    increased $91.3 million, partially offset by a
    $13.2 million decrease in interest rate swap receivables.

Land, buildings, and equipment

increased
    $94.2 million, as capital expenditures of
    $522.0 million were partially offset by depreciation
    expense of $455.1 million, including accelerated
    depreciation charges against long-lived assets related to
    restructured facilities in Trenton, Ontario and Poplar,
    Wisconsin. In addition, our Lanus, Argentina plant was destroyed
    by fire and we sold facilities in Allentown, Pennsylvania and
    Vallejo, California in fiscal 2008.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

increased
    $33.9 million from fiscal 2007 as increases from foreign
    currency translation of $170.5 million and the finalization
    of purchase accounting for the Saxby Bros. Limited and Uncle
    Tobys acquisitions of $15.3 million were partially offset
    by a $151.9 million decrease due to the adoption of
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No.
    (FIN) 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109” (FIN 48).

Other assets

increased $163.5 million from fiscal
    2007, driven by a $91.6 million increase in our prepaid
    pension asset following our annual update of assumptions and
    fiscal 2008 asset performance, and a $92.1 million increase
    in interest rate derivative receivables resulting from a
    decrease in interest rates.

Accounts payable

increased $159.4 million to
    $937.3 million in fiscal 2008 from higher vendor payables
    associated with increases in inventories and payables for
    construction in progress, as well as foreign exchange
    translation.

Long-term debt

, including current portion, and

notes
    payable

together increased $793.4 million from fiscal
    2007 due to borrowings utilized for the repurchase of
    $843.0 million of

Series B-1

limited membership interests in GMC.

The current and noncurrent portions of

deferred income taxes

increased $117.1 million to $1,483.0 million due
    to increases in our pension asset and the beneficial tax
    treatment for certain inventories and investments, partially
    offset by increases in our deferred compensation deferred tax
    asset. We also incurred $98.1 million of deferred income
    tax expense in fiscal 2008.

Other current liabilities

decreased $839.0 million
    to $1,239.8 million, reflecting the adoption of
    FIN 48, which required us to reclassify $810.6 million
    of accrued taxes and related interest from current to noncurrent
    based on the expected timing of any required future payments.

Other liabilities

increased $694.0 million, driven
    by increases to accrued taxes of $628.6 million from the
    adoption of FIN 48 and increases in interest rate swap
    liabilities of $66.6 million.

Our

minority interests

decreased by $896.5 million
    mainly as a result of our repurchase of the

Series B-1

limited membership interests in GMC and the preferred stock of
    General Mills Capital, Inc., net of proceeds from the sale of
    additional Class A interests in GMC.

Retained earnings

increased $765.4 million,
    reflecting fiscal 2008 net earnings of
    $1,294.7 million less dividends of $529.7 million.

Treasury stock

decreased $4,539.6 million due to the
    retirement of $5,080.8 million of treasury stock and a
    $581.8 million decrease related to the settlement of a
    forward purchase contract



with Lehman Brothers, offset by share repurchases of
    $1,384.6 million.

Additional paid in capital

decreased $4,692.2 million due to a
    $5,068.3 million decrease from the treasury stock
    retirement, offset by increases of $168.2 million related
    to the Lehman Brothers contract and $133.2 million related
    to stock compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2008
    earnings.

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

increased by $296.4 million after-tax, driven by

    2007 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For fiscal 2007, we reported diluted EPS of $3.18, up
    9.7 percent from $2.90 per share earned in fiscal 2006.
    Earnings after tax were $1,143.9 million in fiscal 2007, up
    4.9 percent from $1,090.3 million in fiscal 2006.

The components of net sales growth are shown in the following

Net sales

for fiscal 2007 grew 6.2 percent to
    $12.4 billion, driven by 3.4 percentage points from
    volume growth, mainly in our U.S. Retail and International
    segments, and 2.2 percentage points of growth from net
    price realization and product mix across many of our businesses.
    In addition, foreign currency exchange effects added
    0.6 percentage points of growth.

Cost of sales

was up $410.3 million in fiscal 2007
    versus fiscal 2006. Higher volume drove $264.4 million of
    this increase along with an increase of $145.9 million in
    input costs and changes in mix. Cost of sales as a percent of
    net sales decreased from 64.4 percent in fiscal 2006 to
    63.9 percent in fiscal 2007 as $115.0 million of
    higher ingredient (mostly grains and dairy) and energy costs
    were more than offset by efficiency gains at our manufacturing
    facilities.

SG&A expenses

increased by $211.6 million in
    fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006. SG&A expense as a percent
    of net sales increased from 18.6 percent in fiscal 2006 to
    19.2 percent in fiscal 2007. The increase in SG&A
    expense from fiscal 2006 was largely the result of an
    8.2 percent increase in media and brand-building consumer
    marketing spending and $68.8 million of incremental stock
    compensation expense resulting from our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123 (Revised), “Share-Based
    Payment” (SFAS 123R).

Net interest

for fiscal 2007 totaled $426.5 million,
    $26.9 million higher than net interest for fiscal 2006.
    Higher interest rates caused nearly all of the increase. Net
    interest includes preferred distributions paid on minority
    interests. The average rate on our total outstanding debt and
    minority interests was 6.3 percent in fiscal 2007, compared
    to 5.8 percent in fiscal 2006.

Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs

totaled
    $39.3 million in fiscal 2007 as follows:

    product lines

    product lines

In fiscal 2007, we concluded that the future cash flows
    generated by certain product lines in our Bakeries and
    Foodservice segment would not be sufficient to recover the net
    book value of the related long-lived assets, and we recorded a
    noncash impairment charge against these assets.

The

effective income tax rate

was 34.3 percent for
    fiscal 2007, including an increase of $29.4 million in
    benefits from our international tax structure and benefits from
    the settlement of tax audits. In fiscal 2006, our effective
    income tax rate was 34.5 percent, including the benefit of
    $11.0 million of adjustments to deferred tax liabilities
    associated with our International segment’s brand
    intangibles.

After-tax earnings from joint ventures

totaled
    $72.7 million in fiscal 2007, compared to
    $69.2 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, net sales for
    CPW grew 17.9 percent, including 5.5 points of incremental
    sales from the Uncle Tobys cereal business it acquired in
    Australia. In February 2006, CPW announced a restructuring of
    its manufacturing plants in the United Kingdom. Our after-tax
    earnings from joint ventures were reduced by



$8.2 million in both fiscal 2007 and 2006 for our share of
    the restructuring costs, mainly accelerated depreciation and
    severance. Net sales for our Häagen-Dazs joint ventures in
    Asia declined 6.8 percent in fiscal 2007, reflecting a
    change in our reporting period for these joint ventures. We
    changed this reporting period to include results through
    March 31. In previous years, we included results for the
    twelve months ended April 30. Accordingly, fiscal 2007
    included only 11 months of results from these joint
    ventures, compared to 12 months in fiscal 2006. The impact
    of this change was not material to our consolidated results of
    operations, so we did not restate prior periods for
    comparability.

Average diluted shares outstanding

decreased by
    18.6 million from fiscal 2006 due to our repurchase of
    25.3 million shares of stock during fiscal 2007, partially
    offset by increases in diluted shares outstanding from the
    issuance of annual stock awards.

RESULTS
    OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS

Our businesses are organized into three operating segments:
    U.S. Retail; International; and Bakeries and Foodservice.

Segment operating profit excludes unallocated corporate items of
    $156.7 million for fiscal 2008, $163.0 million for
    fiscal 2007, and $122.8 million for fiscal 2006; and also
    excludes restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs because
    these items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at
    the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment
    profitability reviewed by our executive management.

U.S. Retail
    Segment

Our U.S. Retail segment
    reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass
    merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, and drug,
    dollar and discount chains operating throughout the United
    States. Our major product categories in this business segment
    are ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, ready-to-serve
    soup, dry dinners, shelf stable and frozen vegetables,
    refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking
    mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory
    snacks, microwave popcorn, and a wide variety of organic
    products including soup, granola bars, and cereal.

In fiscal 2008, net sales for our U.S. Retail segment were
    $9.1 billion, up 6.8 percent from fiscal 2007. This
    growth in net sales was the result of a 3.5 percentage
    point benefit from net price realization and product mix as well
    as a 3.3 percentage point increase in volume, led by strong
    growth in our grain snacks and yogurt businesses.

Net sales for this segment totaled $8.5 billion in fiscal
    2007 and $8.1 billion in fiscal 2006. Volume increased
    2.3 percentage points in fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006,
    led by strong growth in our grain snacks business as well as
    volume increases in our Yoplait, Meals, and Pillsbury divisions.
    The volume increase was largely driven by higher levels of
    consumer marketing spending and new product innovation,
    resulting in higher sales to key customers.

All of our U.S. Retail divisions experienced net sales

    performance by

Yoplait Light

yogurt and new products
    including

yogurt. Net sales
    for Snacks grew 12.3 percent led by continued strong sales
    for

bars.
    Baking Products net sales grew 8.5 percent due to increases
    in

Betty Crocker

cookie mixes,

Gold Medal

    and the launch of

Minis.

For fiscal 2007, Big G cereals net sales grew 1.6 percent
    as a result of new product launches such as

Fruity Cheerios

and

Nature Valley

cereals, and continued strong
    performance of the

Cheerios

franchise. Net sales for
    Meals grew 5.2 percent led by the introduction of

Progresso

reduced sodium soups and

Hamburger Helper
    Microwave Singles

and the continued strong performance of
    our other

Hamburger Helper

and

Progresso

offerings. Net sales for Pillsbury increased
    2.7 percent as core refrigerated dough products,

Totino’s Pizza Rolls

pizza snacks, and

Toaster
    Strudel

pastries all generated solid growth. Yoplait net
    sales grew 6.5 percent due to strong performance by

Yoplait Light, Go-GURT

, and

yogurt.
    Net sales for Snacks grew 10.3 percent led by continuing
    growth for

bars. Baking Products net sales
    grew 2.5 percent reflecting greater focus on product lines
    such as

Bisquick

Warm Delights

microwaveable desserts.

Segment operating profit of $2.0 billion in fiscal 2008
    improved $74.6 million, or 3.9 percent, over fiscal
    2007. Net price realization increased segment operating profit
    by $317.0 million and volume growth increased segment
    operating profit by $95.4 million.



These were offset by increased supply chain input costs of
    $181.0 million, higher administrative costs, and an
    11.7 percent increase in consumer marketing expense
    consistent with our brand-building strategy. Voluntary product
    recalls reduced segment operating profit by $24.0 million.

Segment operating profit of $1.9 billion in fiscal 2007
    improved $95.2 million, or 5.3 percent, over fiscal
    2006. Unit volume increased segment operating profit by
    $90.3 million, and inflation in ingredients (mostly grains
    and dairy), energy, and labor costs was more than offset by
    efficiency gains at our manufacturing facilities resulting from
    cost-saving capital projects, changes to product formulations,
    and continued actions to reduce low-turning products. These
    increases in segment operating profit were partially offset by a
    5.7 percent increase in brand-building consumer marketing
    spending.

International
    Segment

In Canada, our major product
    categories are ready-to-eat cereals, shelf stable and frozen
    vegetables, dry dinners, refrigerated and frozen dough products,
    dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks, and grain, fruit
    and savory snacks. In markets outside North America, our product
    categories include super-premium ice cream, grain snacks, shelf
    stable and frozen vegetables, dough products, and dry dinners.
    Our International segment also includes products manufactured in
    the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin
    American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to
    our international joint ventures. Revenues from export
    activities are reported in the region or country where the end
    customer is located. These international businesses are managed
    through 34 sales and marketing offices.

    from the launch of

Nature Valley

granola bars in several

ice cream and continued strong
    performance from

Old El Paso

and

across the region, and especially in the United Kingdom. The
    acquisition of Saxby Bros. Limited, a chilled pastry company in
    the

Segment operating profit for fiscal 2008 grew to
    $268.9 million, up 24.7 percent from fiscal 2007, with
    foreign currency exchange contributing 9.1 points of that
    growth. Segment operating profit increased by $37.5 million
    mainly from higher volumes. Net price realization more than
    offset higher supply chain input costs, a 21.7 percent
    increase in consumer marketing expense, and administrative cost
    increases.

Segment operating profit for fiscal 2007 grew to
    $215.7 million, up 11.2 percent from fiscal 2006, with
    foreign currency exchange contributing 4.5 points of that
    growth. The growth was led by a $45.6 million increase from
    higher volumes driven by increases in consumer marketing
    spending. Net price realization offset supply chain and
    administrative cost increases.

Bakeries and Foodservice
    Segment

In our Bakeries and Foodservice
    segment we sell branded ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, dinner and
    side dish products, refrigerated and soft-serve frozen yogurt,
    frozen dough products, branded baking mixes, and custom food
    items. Our customers include foodservice distributors and
    operators, convenience stores, vending machine operators, quick
    service and other restaurant operators, and business and school
    cafeterias in the United States and Canada. In addition, we
    market mixes and unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products
    throughout the United States and Canada to retail, supermarket,
    and wholesale bakeries.

For fiscal 2008, net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice
    segment increased 10.6 percent to $2.0 billion. The
    growth in fiscal 2008 net sales was driven mainly by
    15.8 percentage points of benefit from net price
    realization and product mix, as we took price increases to
    offset higher supply chain input costs. This was partially
    offset by a 1.3 percentage point decline in volume on
    continuing businesses, mainly in the distributors and
    restaurants customer channel, and a 3.9 percentage point
    decline due to the effects of divested product lines.

Net sales increased 5.1 percent from fiscal 2006 to fiscal
    2007. Fiscal 2007 volume grew 3.9 percentage points
    compared to fiscal 2006, driven by: increased sales of higher
    margin, branded products and the introduction of new products to
    customers such as schools, hotels, restaurants, and convenience
    stores; improved innovation in foodservice products; and
    favorable net price realization.

In fiscal 2008, segment operating profits were
    $165.4 million, up 11.9 percent from
    $147.8 million in fiscal 2007. The increase for the year
    was driven by grain merchandising activities and benefits from
    prior restructuring activities. Net price realization offset
    higher supply chain input costs and a decrease in volume.

Segment operating profits were $147.8 million in fiscal
    2007, up 27.1 percent from $116.3 million in fiscal
    2006. The business was able to offset high levels of input cost
    inflation with a combination of pricing actions, sourcing
    productivity, and manufacturing improvements.

Unallocated Corporate
    Items

Unallocated corporate items include
    variances to planned corporate overhead expenses, variances to
    planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, all stock
    compensation costs, annual contributions to the General Mills
    Foundation, and other items that are not part of our measurement
    of segment operating performance. This includes restructuring,
    impairment, and other exit costs, as well as gains and losses
    from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions
    until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with
    our internal hedge documentation as discussed in Note 7 of
    the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this
    report.

For fiscal 2008, unallocated corporate items totaled
    $156.7 million of expense compared to $163.0 million
    for the same period last year. During fiscal 2008, we recognized
    a net gain of $59.6 million related to the mark-to-market
    valuation of certain commodity positions and a previously
    deferred gain of $10.8 million on the sale of a corporate
    investment. These gains were offset by $25.6 million of
    unfavorable foreign exchange, $18.5 million of charges to
    cost of sales, primarily accelerated depreciation on long-lived
    assets associated with previously announced restructuring
    actions, and $9.2 million of expense related to the
    remarketing of minority interests in our GMC subsidiary.

Unallocated corporate items were $163.0 million in fiscal
    2007 compared to $122.8 million in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007
    included $68.8 million of incremental expense relating to
    the impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R, and fiscal 2006
    included $32.7 million of charges related to increases in
    environmental reserves and a write-down of the asset value of a
    low-income housing investment. Excluding these items,
    unallocated corporate items were essentially unchanged from
    fiscal 2006.

Joint
    Ventures

In addition to our consolidated
    operations, we participate in several joint ventures.

International Joint Ventures

We have a
    50 percent equity interest in CPW, which manufactures and
    markets ready-to-eat cereal products in more than 130 countries
    and republics outside the United States and Canada. CPW also
    markets cereal bars in several European countries and
    manufactures private label cereals for customers in the United
    Kingdom. Results from our CPW joint venture are reported for the
    12 months ended March 31. On July 14, 2006, CPW
    acquired the Uncle Tobys cereal business in Australia for
    $385.6 million. We funded our 50 percent share of the
    purchase price by making additional advances to and equity
    contributions in CPW totaling $135.1 million (classified as
    investments in affiliates, net on the Consolidated Statements of
    Cash Flows) and by acquiring a 50 percent undivided
    interest in certain intellectual property for $57.7 million
    (classified as acquisitions on the Consolidated Statements of
    Cash Flows). We funded the advances to and our equity
    contribution in CPW from cash generated by our international
    operations, including our international joint ventures.

We have 50 percent equity interests in Häagen-Dazs
    Japan, Inc. and Häagen-Dazs Korea Company. These joint
    ventures manufacture, distribute, and market

Häagen-Dazs

ice cream products and frozen novelties. In fiscal 2007, we
    changed the reporting period for the Häagen-Dazs joint
    ventures. Accordingly, fiscal 2007 includes only 11 months
    of results from these joint ventures compared to 12 months
    in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2006.

Domestic Joint Venture

During fiscal 2008,
    the 8th Continent soy milk business was sold, and our
    50 percent share of the after-tax gain on the sale was
    $2.2 million, of which $1.7 million was recorded in
    fiscal 2008. We will record an additional gain in



the first quarter of fiscal 2010 if certain conditions related
    to the sale are satisfied.

Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings increased from
    $72.7 million in fiscal 2007 to $110.8 million in
    fiscal 2008. This growth was largely driven by strong sales
    growth, favorable foreign exchange, and our share of the gain
    from the sale of a property.

Our after-tax share of CPW restructuring, impairment, and other
    exit costs pursuant to approved plans during fiscal 2008 and
    prior years was as follows:

Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings increased from
    $69.2 million in fiscal 2006 to $72.7 million in
    fiscal 2007. This growth was largely driven by strong core brand
    volume and organic net sales growth, new product innovation, and
    increases in brand-building consumer marketing spending,
    partially offset by a $2.0 million impact of the change in
    reporting period for the Häagen-Dazs joint ventures and a
    $8.2 million restructuring charge in 2007.

The change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in

For fiscal 2008, CPW net sales grew by 23.3 percent
    reflecting higher volume, key new product introductions
    including

Oats & More

in the United Kingdom and

Nesquik Duo

across a number of regions, favorable foreign
    currency effects, and the benefit of a full year of sales from
    the fiscal 2007 Uncle Tobys acquisition. Net sales for our
    Häagen-Dazs joint ventures increased 15.7 percent from
    fiscal 2007, as a result of favorable foreign exchange and
    introductory product shipments.

For fiscal 2007, CPW net sales grew by 17.9 percent
    reflecting the introduction of new products and favorable
    currency translation. The acquisition of Uncle Tobys in
    Australia also contributed 5.5 points of CPW’s net sales
    growth. Net sales for our Häagen-Dazs joint ventures
    declined 6.8 percent from fiscal 2006, reflecting the
    change in our reporting period for these joint ventures.

IMPACT
    OF INFLATION

We have experienced strong levels of input cost inflation since
    fiscal 2006. Our gross margin performance in fiscal 2008
    reflects the impact of significant input cost inflation,
    primarily from commodities and energy inputs.

For fiscal 2009, we expect inflationary trends to accelerate,
    with input costs (fuel, energy, commodities, and employee
    benefits) forecasted to be 9 percent higher than fiscal
    2008 levels. We expect to mitigate this inflationary pressure
    through cost saving initiatives and pricing.

We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through
    appropriate planning and operating practices. Our risk
    management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this
    report.

LIQUIDITY

The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from
    operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our
    operations have generated $5.3 billion in cash. A
    substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been
    returned to stockholders annually through share repurchases and
    dividends. We also use this source of liquidity to fund our
    annual capital expenditures. We typically



use a combination of available cash, notes payable, and
    long-term debt to finance acquisitions and major capital
    expansions.

Our cash flow from operations decreased $21.3 million from
    fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 as a $150.8 million increase in
    net earnings and the $72.1 million effect of changes in
    deferred income taxes were more than offset by an increase of
    $275.8 million in working capital compared to the prior
    year. Accounts receivable was a $69.9 million increased use
    of cash, partially offset by a $37.3 million increase in
    cash from accounts payable, and inventory was a
    $49.1 million increased use of cash in fiscal 2008. Working
    capital also includes $59.6 million of mark-to-market gains
    on our commodity derivatives. In addition, other current
    liabilities had a $173.1 million reduction to the source of
    cash driven by cash taxes paid in fiscal 2008.

We strive to grow a key measure, core working capital, at or
    below our growth in net sales. For fiscal 2008, core working
    capital grew 12.1 percent, more than our net sales growth
    of 9.7 percent, largely driven by the effect of increases
    in commodity prices on inventories and an increase in accounts
    receivable. In fiscal 2007, core working capital grew
    4.2 percent, less than net sales growth of
    6.2 percent, and in fiscal 2006, core working capital grew
    5.0 percent and net sales grew 3.6 percent.

The $92.3 million decrease in cash flows from operations
    from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was the result of a reduction in
    our cash flows from working capital and a decrease in
    distributions of earnings from joint ventures, offset by an
    increase in net earnings.

In fiscal 2008, cash used by investing activities decreased by

    CPW’s acquisition of the Uncle Tobys cereal business in
    Australia (reflected in acquisitions and investments in
    affiliates, net), acquired Saxby Bros. Limited, and acquired our
    master franchisee of

Häagen-Dazs

shops in Greece.
    During fiscal 2008, we sold our former production facilities in
    Vallejo, California and Allentown, Pennsylvania, while in fiscal
    2007 we sold our frozen pie product line, including a plant in
    Rochester, New York, and our par-baked bread product line,
    including plants in Chelsea, Massachusetts and Tempe, Arizona.
    Capital investment for land, buildings, and equipment increased
    by $61.8 million, as we continued to increase manufacturing
    capacity for our snack bars and yogurt products and began
    consolidating manufacturing for our

Old El Paso

business. We expect capital expenditures to increase to
    approximately $550 million in fiscal 2009, including
    initiatives that will: increase manufacturing capacity for

Yoplait

yogurt,

Nature Valley

bars, and

Progresso

soup; increase productivity throughout the
    supply chain; and continue upgrades to our International
    segment’s information technology systems.

Net cash used by financing activities decreased by
    $305.1 million in fiscal 2008. Further details for fiscal
    2008 and fiscal 2007 financing actions are described in
    Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this report.

On April 11, 2007, we issued $1.15 billion aggregate
    principal amount of floating-rate convertible senior notes. On
    April 11, 2008, the holders of those notes put
    $1.14 billion of the aggregate principal amount to us for
    repurchase. We issued commercial paper to fund the repurchase.

On March 17, 2008, we sold $750.0 million of
    5.2 percent fixed-rate notes due March 17, 2015 and on
    August 29, 2007, we sold $700.0 million of
    5.65 percent fixed-rate notes due September 10, 2012.
    The proceeds of the notes were used to repay outstanding
    commercial paper. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually
    in arrears. The notes may be redeemed at our option at any time
    for a specified make-whole amount. The notes are senior
    unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and contain a change of
    control provision, as defined in the instruments governing the
    notes.

On October 15, 2007, we settled the forward contract
    established with Lehman Brothers in October 2004 in conjunction
    with the issuance by Lehman Brothers of $750.0 million of
    notes that were mandatorily exchangeable for shares of our
    common stock. In settlement of that forward contract, we issued
    14.3 million shares of our common stock and received
    $750.0 million in cash from Lehman Brothers. We used the
    cash received to reduce outstanding commercial paper balances.

On August 7, 2007, we repurchased for a net amount of
    $843.0 million all of the outstanding

Series B-1

Interests in GMC as part of a required remarketing of those
    interests. The purchase price reflected the

Series B-1

Interests’ original capital account balance of
    $835.0 million and $8.0 million of capital account
    appreciation attributable and paid to the third party holder of
    the

Series B-1

Interests. The capital appreciation paid to the third party
    holder of the

Series B-1

Interests was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, a
    component of stockholders’ equity, on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets, and reduced net earnings available to common
    stockholders in our basic and diluted EPS calculations.

We and the third party holder of all of GMC’s outstanding
    Class A limited membership interests (Class A
    Interests) agreed to reset, effective on June 28, 2007, the
    preferred rate of return applicable to the Class A
    Interests to the sum of three- month LIBOR plus 65 basis
    points. On June 28, 2007, we sold $92.3 million of
    additional Class A Interests to the same third party. There
    was no gain or loss associated with these transactions. As of
    May 25, 2008, the carrying value of all outstanding
    Class A Interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was
    $242.3 million, and the capital account balance of the
    Class A Interests upon which preferred distributions are
    calculated was $248.1 million.

On June 28, 2007, we repurchased for $150.0 million
    all of the outstanding Series A preferred stock of our
    subsidiary General Mills Capital, Inc. using proceeds from the
    sale of the Class A Interests and commercial paper. There
    was no gain or loss associated with this repurchase.

During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 23.6 million shares of
    our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of
    $1,368.0 million, of which $0.1 million settled after
    the end of our fiscal year. In fiscal 2007, our Board of
    Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 75 million
    shares of our common stock. Purchases under the authorization
    can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated
    transactions, including the use of call options and other
    derivative instruments,

Rule 10b5-1

trading plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The
    authorization has no specified termination date. During fiscal
    2007, we repurchased 25.3 million shares for an aggregate
    purchase price of $1,385.2 million, of



which $64.5 million settled after the end of our fiscal
    year. In fiscal 2006, we repurchased 18.8 million shares of
    common stock for an aggregate purchase price of
    $892.3 million.

Dividends paid in fiscal 2008 totaled $529.7 million, or
    $1.57 per share, a 9.0 percent per share increase from
    fiscal 2007. Dividends paid in fiscal 2007 totaled
    $505.2 million, or $1.44 per share, a 7.5 percent per
    share increase from fiscal 2006 dividends of $1.34 per share.
    Our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase
    from $0.40 per share to $0.43 per share effective with the
    dividend payable on August 1, 2008.

Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing.
    We can issue commercial paper in the United States, Canada, and
    Europe. Our commercial paper borrowings are supported by
    $3.0 billion of fee-paid committed credit lines and
    $403.8 million in uncommitted lines. As of May 25,
    2008, there were no amounts outstanding on the fee-paid
    committed credit lines and $133.8 million was drawn on the
    uncommitted lines, all by our international operations.

In October 2007, we entered into a new five-year credit
    agreement with an initial aggregate revolving commitment of
    $1.9 billion which is scheduled to expire in October 2012.
    Concurrent with the execution of the new credit agreement, we
    terminated our five-year credit agreement dated January 20,
    2004, which provided $750.0 million of revolving credit and
    was scheduled to expire in January 2009, and our amended and
    restated credit agreement dated October 17, 2006, which
    provided $1.1 billion of revolving credit and was scheduled
    to expire in October 2007. We then terminated our credit
    agreement dated August 3, 2007, which provided an aggregate
    revolving commitment of $750.0 million and was scheduled to
    expire on December 6, 2007.

Our credit facilities, certain of our long-term debt agreements,
    and our minority interests contain restrictive covenants. As of
    May 25, 2008, we were in compliance with all of these
    covenants.

We have $442.0 million of long-term debt maturing in the
    next 12 months that is classified as current, including
    $109.5 million of notes that may mature based on the put
    rights of the note holders. We also have classified
    $150.6 million of long-term debt as current based on our
    intention to redeem the debt within the next 12 months. We
    believe that cash flows from operations, together with available
    short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet
    our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next
    12 months.

As of May 25, 2008, our total debt, including the impact of
    derivative instruments designated as hedges, was
    65.7 percent in fixed-rate and 34.3 percent in
    floating-rate instruments compared to 50.0 percent each in
    fixed-rate and floating-rate instruments as of May 27,
    2007. The change in the fixed-rate and floating-rate percentages
    were driven by the refinancing of $1.5 billion of
    commercial paper and minority interests with fixed-rate notes,
    and the new swap of $500.0 million of floating-rate debt to
    fixed-rate during fiscal 2008.

The Board of Directors approved the retirement of
    125.0 million shares of common stock in treasury effective
    December 10, 2007. This action reduced common stock by
    $12.5 million, reduced additional paid-in capital by
    $5,068.3 million, and reduced common stock in treasury by
    $5,080.8 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) covering the sale
    of debt securities, common stock, preference stock, depository
    shares, securities warrants, purchase contracts, purchase units,
    and units. As of May 25, 2008, $2.2 billion remained
    available under the shelf registration for future use.

We believe that growth in return on average total capital is a
    key performance measure. Return on average total capital
    improved from 11.1 percent in fiscal 2007 to
    12.1 percent in fiscal



2008 due to higher operating results, the impact of net
    mark-to-market gains on certain commodity positions, and the
    effect of a discrete tax item. We also believe important
    measures of financial strength are the ratio of fixed charge
    coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt. Our fixed
    charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2008 was 4.87 compared to 4.37
    in fiscal 2007. The measure increased from fiscal 2007 as
    earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint
    ventures increased by $174.8 million and fixed charges
    decreased by $2.2 million. Our operating cash flow to debt
    ratio decreased 3.5 percent to 24.7 percent in fiscal
    2008, driven by a slight decrease in cash flows from operations
    and an increase in our year end debt balance.

Currently, Standard and Poor’s (S&P) has ratings of
    BBB+ on our publicly held long-term debt and

A-2

on our
    commercial paper. Moody’s Investors Services (Moody’s)
    has ratings of Baa1 for our long-term debt and

P-2

for our
    commercial paper. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) rates our long-term debt
    BBB+ and our commercial paper

F-2.

These
    ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
    securities, are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by
    the rating organization, and should be evaluated independently
    of any other rating. We intend to manage our financial condition
    and ratios to maintain these ratings levels for the foreseeable
    future.

In April 2002, we contributed assets with an aggregate fair
    market value of $4.2 billion to our subsidiary GMC. The
    contributed assets consist primarily of manufacturing assets and
    intellectual property associated with the production and retail
    sale of Big G cereals,

Progresso

soups, and

Old
    El Paso

products in the United States. In exchange for
    the contribution of these assets, GMC issued its managing
    membership interest and its limited preferred membership
    interests to certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We
    continue to hold the entire managing membership interest, and
    therefore direct the operations of GMC. Other than the right to
    consent to certain actions, holders of the limited preferred
    membership interests do not participate in the management of
    GMC. We currently hold all interests in GMC other than the
    Class A Interests.

The terms of the Class A Interests are described in the
    Fifth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement
    of GMC (the LLC Agreement). The holder of the Class A
    Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from
    available net income based on the application of a floating
    preferred return rate, currently equal to the sum of three-month
    LIBOR plus 65 basis points, to the holder’s capital
    account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market
    valuation (currently $248.1 million). The LLC Agreement
    requires that the preferred return rate of the Class A
    Interests be adjusted every five years through a negotiated
    agreement between the Class A Interest holder and GMC, or
    through a remarketing auction. The next remarketing is scheduled
    to occur in June 2012 and thereafter in five year intervals.
    Upon a failed remarketing, the preferred return rate over
    three-month LIBOR will be increased by 75 basis points
    until the next remarketing, which will occur in 3 month
    intervals until a successful remarketing occurs or the managing
    member purchases the Class A Interests. The managing member
    may at any time elect to purchase all of the Class A
    Interests for an amount equal to the holder’s capital
    account balance (as adjusted in a mark-to-market valuation),
    plus any accrued but unpaid preferred returns and the prescribed
    make-whole amount.

Holders of the Class A Interests may initiate a liquidation
    of GMC under certain circumstances, including, without
    limitation, the bankruptcy of GMC or its subsidiaries,
    GMC’s failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the
    Class A Interests, GMC’s failure to comply with
    portfolio requirements, breaches of certain covenants, lowering
    of our senior debt rating below either Baa3 by Moody’s or
    BBB- by S&P, and a failed attempt to remarket the
    Class A Interests as a result of GMC’s failure to
    assist in such remarketing. In the event of a liquidation of
    GMC, each member of GMC will receive the amount of its then
    current capital account balance. The managing member may avoid
    liquidation by exercising its option to purchase the
    Class A Interests.

For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities,
    results of operations, and cash flows of GMC are included in our
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The return to the third party
    investor is reflected in net interest in the Consolidated
    Statements of Earnings. The third party investor’s
    interests in GMC are classified as minority interests on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. As discussed above, we may exercise
    our option to purchase the Class A Interests for
    consideration equal to the then current capital account value,
    plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole
    amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the
    unrelated third party investor’s capital account from its
    original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and
    will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS
    in that period.



OFF-BALANCE
    SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

As of May 25, 2008, we have issued guarantees and comfort
    letters of $670.1 million for the debt and other
    obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and
    comfort letters of $340.3 million for the debt and other
    obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In
    addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited
    to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases,
    which totaled $315.3 million as of May 25, 2008.

As of May 25, 2008, we had invested in 3 variable interest
    entities (VIEs). We have an interest in a contract manufacturer
    at our former facility in Geneva, Illinois. We are the primary
    beneficiary (PB) and have consolidated this entity as of
    May 25, 2008. This entity had property and equipment with a
    carrying value of $31.0 million and long-term debt of
    $31.8 million as of May 25, 2008. We also have an
    interest in a contract manufacturer in Greece that is a VIE.
    Although we are the PB, we have not consolidated this entity
    because it is not material to our results of operations,
    financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the year ended
    May 25, 2008. This entity had assets of $4.2 million
    and liabilities of $0.9 million as of May 25, 2008. We
    are not the PB of the remaining VIE. Our maximum exposure to
    loss from the 3 VIEs is limited to the $31.8 million of
    long-term debt of the contract manufacturer in Geneva, Illinois
    and our $1.1 million equity investment in the VIE of which
    we are not the PB.

On August 17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act (PPA) became
    law in the United States. The PPA revised the basis and
    methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding
    requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits
    paid from tax-qualified plans. Most of these provisions are
    first applicable to our domestic defined benefit pension plans
    in fiscal 2009 on a phased-in basis. The PPA may ultimately
    require us to make additional contributions to our domestic
    plans. However, due to our historical funding practices and
    current funded status, we do not expect to have significant
    statutory or contractual funding requirements for our major
    defined benefit plans during the next several years. No fiscal
    2009 domestic plan contributions are currently expected. Actual
    fiscal 2009 contributions could exceed our current projections,
    and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary
    funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment
    priorities, or by future changes in government requirements.
    Additionally, our projections concerning timing of the PPA
    funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced
    by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust
    asset performance, interest rates, and our future decisions
    regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA.

The following table summarizes our future estimated cash
    payments under existing contractual obligations, including

Subsequent to May 25, 2008, we

    $391.1 million in 2009, $782.2 million in

2010-11,

and
    $22.8 million in

2012-13.

Principal payments due on long-term debt are based on stated
    contractual maturities or put rights of certain note holders.
    The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments
    for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal
    course of business and for consumer marketing spending
    commitments that support our brands. The fair value of our
    interest rate and equity swaps with a payable position to the
    counterparty was $220.1 million as of May 25, 2008,
    based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in
    market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or
    received to settle those instruments in the future. Other
    long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for
    uncertain income tax positions, accrued compensation and
    benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our
    defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and
    postemployment benefit plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We
    expect to pay $16.6 million of benefits from our unfunded
    postemployment benefit plans in fiscal 2009. Further information
    on



all of these plans is included in Note 13 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

For a complete description of our significant accounting
    policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our significant
    accounting estimates are those that have meaningful impact on
    the reporting of our financial condition and results of
    operations. These estimates include our accounting for
    promotional expenditures, intangible assets, stock compensation,
    income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement
    and postemployment benefits.

Promotional
    Expenditures

Our promotional activities are
    conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with
    end consumers. These activities include: payments to customers
    to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as
    advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices
    to lower retail shelf prices and payments to gain distribution
    of new products; coupons, contests, and other incentives; and
    media and advertising expenditures. The media and advertising
    expenditures are recognized as expense when the advertisement
    airs. The cost of payments to customers and other consumer
    activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded,
    which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The
    recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer
    participation and performance levels. These estimates are made
    based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing and
    forecasted costs of promotional activities, and other factors.
    Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are
    normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in
    management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade,
    coupon, and consumer marketing liabilities were
    $446.0 million as of May 25, 2008, and
    $410.1 million as of May 27, 2007. Because our total
    promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a
    reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are
    inaccurate we would have to make adjustments that could have a
    material effect on our results of operations.

Valuation of Long-Lived
    Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be
    recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
    estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and
    disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount
    of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows
    independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment
    loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the
    asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using
    discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate.

Intangible
    Assets

Goodwill is not subject to
    amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may
    have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for each of our
    reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting
    unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit.
    Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated
    with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires
    allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units.
    If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
    value, we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting
    unit, excluding goodwill, to determine if the fair value of the
    net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill. If
    the fair value of the net assets is less than the net assets
    including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of
    fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model.
    Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs
    from our annual long-range planning process. We also make
    estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions,
    market comparables, and other factors.

We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets,
    mainly intangible assets associated with the

Pillsbury,
    Totino’s, Progresso, Green Giant

,

Old El Paso,
    Häagen-Dazs

and

Uncle Tobys

brands, to determine
    if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination
    on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions
    regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand,
    competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of
    the industry, known technological advances, legislative action
    that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment,
    and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of
    required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of
    other related groups of assets.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly brands, are also
    tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be



recoverable. We performed our fiscal 2008 assessment of our
    brand intangibles as of December 1, 2007. Our estimate of
    the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow
    model using inputs which included: projected revenues from our
    annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates that could be
    payable if we did not own the brands; and a discount rate. All
    brand intangibles had fair values in excess of their carrying
    values by at least 20 percent, except for the

Pillsbury

brand, which we estimated had a fair value 3 percent
    higher than its carrying value. This brand comprises nearly
    one-half of our total indefinite-lived intangible assets.

If the growth rate for the global revenue from all uses of the

Pillsbury

brand decreases 50 basis points from the
    current planned growth rate, fair value would be reduced by
    approximately $150 million, assuming all other components
    of the fair value estimate remain unchanged. If the assumed
    royalty rate for all uses of the

Pillsbury

brand
    decreases by 50 basis points, fair value would be reduced
    by approximately $130 million, assuming all other
    components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged. If the
    applicable discount rate increases by 50 basis points, fair
    value of the

Pillsbury

brand would be reduced by
    approximately $170 million, assuming all other components
    of the fair value estimate remain unchanged. As of May 25,
    2008, we reviewed each of the assumptions used in the annual
    impairment assessment performed as of December 1, 2007, and
    found them to still be appropriate.

As of May 25, 2008, we had $10.6 billion of goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently
    believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its
    carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will
    contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different
    assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses could
    result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense.

Stock
    Compensation

Effective May 29, 2006, we
    adopted SFAS 123R, which changed the accounting for
    compensation expense associated with stock options, restricted
    stock awards, and other forms of equity compensation. We elected
    the modified prospective transition method as permitted by
    SFAS 123R; accordingly, results from prior periods were not
    restated. Under this method, stock-based compensation expense
    for fiscal 2007 was $127.1 million, which included
    amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of all
    equity compensation awards granted prior to May 29, 2006,
    based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
    the original provisions of SFAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
    (SFAS 123), and amortization related to all equity
    compensation awards granted on or subsequent to May 29,
    2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance
    with the provisions of SFAS 123R. The incremental effect on
    net earnings in fiscal 2007 of our adoption of SFAS 123R
    was $68.8 million of expense ($42.9 million
    after-tax). All our stock compensation expense is recorded in
    SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Prior to May 29, 2006, we used the intrinsic value method
    for measuring the cost of compensation paid in our common stock.
    No compensation expense for stock options was recognized in our
    Consolidated Statements of Earnings prior to fiscal 2007, as the
    exercise price was equal to the market price of our stock at the
    date of grant. Expense attributable to other types of
    share-based awards was recognized in our results under
    SFAS 123. The estimated weighted-average fair values of
    stock options granted and the assumptions used for the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows:

The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting
    estimate which requires us to use judgments and assumptions that
    are likely to have a material impact on our financial
    statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding
    future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, and
    dividend yield.

We estimate our future stock price volatility using the
    historical volatility over the expected term of the option,
    excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace
    participant would exclude in estimating our stock price
    volatility. For the fiscal 2008 grants, we have excluded
    historical volatility for fiscal 2002 and prior, primarily
    because volatility driven by our acquisition of The



Pillsbury Company in fiscal 2002 does not reflect what we
    believe to be expected future volatility. We also have
    considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate,
    because trading activity in options on our stock, especially
    those with tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient
    to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility. If all
    other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point
    increase in our fiscal 2008 volatility assumption would increase
    the grant-date fair value of our fiscal 2008 option awards by
    4.3 percent.

For fiscal 2007 and all prior periods, our estimate of expected
    stock price volatility is based on historical volatility
    determined on a daily basis over the expected term of the
    options. We considered but did not use implied volatility
    because we believed historical volatility provided an
    appropriate expectation for our volatility in the future.

Our expected term represents the period of time that options
    granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data
    to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the
    valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar
    historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into
    a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average
    expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table
    above. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving
    all other assumptions constant, would change the grant date fair
    value by significantly less than 1 percent. Our valuation
    model assumes that dividends and our share price increase in
    line with earnings, resulting in a constant dividend yield. The
    risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of
    the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield
    curve in effect at the time of grant.

To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions,
    we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based
    expense to final intrinsic values. However, these differences
    can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon
    exercise of stock options, as explained in the following two
    paragraphs. Furthermore, historical data has a significant
    bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant
    variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to
    prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then
    significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of
    stock-based compensation expense.

SFAS 123R also provides that any corporate income tax
    benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess
    of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a
    “windfall tax benefit”) is presented in the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing (rather
    than an operating) cash flow. For fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007,
    the windfall tax benefits classified as financing cash flow were
    $55.7 million and $73.1 million. The actual impact on
    future years’ financing cash flow will depend, in part, on
    the volume of employee stock option exercises during a
    particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date
    market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date
    fair value previously determined for financial reporting
    purposes.

Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional
    paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized
    shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that
    previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the
    cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then
    charged directly to income tax expense, potentially resulting in
    volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. We
    calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits from
    post-1995 fiscal years for the purpose of accounting for future
    shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative
    windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls,
    such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be
    affected by this provision. However, as employee stock option
    exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that
    materially different reported results could occur if different
    assumptions or conditions were to prevail.

Income
    Taxes

We adopted the provisions of
    FIN 48 as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. Prior to
    adoption, our policy was to establish reserves that reflected
    the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. The effects of
    final resolution, if any, were recognized as changes to the
    effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
    FIN 48 requires application of a more likely than not
    threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax
    positions. FIN 48 permits us to recognize the amount of tax
    benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of
    being ultimately realized upon settlement. It further requires
    that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate
    resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings
    in the quarter of such change.

Annually we file more than 350 income tax returns in
    approximately 100 global taxing jurisdictions. A number of years
    may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and
    finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the
    final outcome or



the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax
    position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect
    the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, as well as
    the related interest, in light of changing facts and
    circumstances. Settlement of any particular position would
    usually require the use of cash.

The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the
    tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions include the
    United States (federal and state) and Canada. We are no longer
    subject to United States federal examinations by the IRS for
    fiscal years before 2002. During fiscal 2008, we received a
    favorable District Court decision on an uncertain tax matter
    related to the fiscal years prior to 2002 and reduced our
    liability for uncertain tax positions by $21.0 million and
    related accrued interest by $9.7 million. The IRS has
    appealed the District Court decision, and accordingly, its
    ultimate resolution is subject to change. During the fiscal
    2008, we also concluded various matters for fiscal years

1998-2001

which included a payment of $31.7 million. The IRS recently
    concluded field examinations for our 2002 and 2003 fiscal years.
    A payment of $24.8 million was made to cover the additional
    tax liability plus interest related to all agreed adjustments
    for this audit cycle. The IRS also proposed additional
    adjustments for the

2002-2003

audit cycle including several adjustments to the tax benefits
    associated with the sale of minority interests in our GMC
    subsidiary. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend
    to vigorously defend our position. Our potential liability for
    this matter is significant and, notwithstanding our reserves
    against this potential liability, an unfavorable resolution
    could have a material adverse impact on our results of
    operations and cash flows from operations. We do not expect the
    amount of our tax reserves for these issues to materially change
    in the next 12 months. The IRS initiated its audit of our
    fiscal 2004 through 2006 tax years during fiscal 2008.

Various tax examinations by United States state taxing
    authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary
    by jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5 years.
    Currently, several state examinations are in progress. The
    Canada Revenue Agency is conducting an audit of our income tax
    returns in Canada for fiscal years 2003 (which is our earliest
    tax year still open for examination) through 2005. We do not
    anticipate that any United States state tax or Canadian tax
    adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial
    position or results of operations.

Defined Benefit Pension,
    Other Postretirement, and Postemployment Benefit
    Plans

We have defined benefit pension plans
    covering most domestic, Canadian, and United Kingdom employees.
    Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service
    and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees
    include various monthly amounts for each year of credited
    service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements
    of applicable laws. We made $14.2 million of voluntary
    contributions to these plans in fiscal 2008. Our principal
    domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a
    provision that any excess pension assets would vest if the plan
    is terminated within five years of a change in control.

We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the
    majority of our domestic and Canadian retirees. The salaried
    health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree
    contributions based on years of service. We fund related trusts
    for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We did
    not make voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2008.

Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits
    to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada,
    and Mexico, and members of our Board of Directors, including
    severance and certain other benefits payable upon death. We
    recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or
    accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not
    vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely
    on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to
    expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are
    unfunded.

We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following
    employment over the plan participants’ active working life.
    Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure
    costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our
    obligations. Assumptions that require significant management
    judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our
    net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit
    obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan
    assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for
    our benefit plans, and the health care cost trend rates.

Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets

Our
    expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our
    asset allocation, our historical long-term investment
    performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset
    class (using input from our



actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and
    long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption
    annually for each plan, however, our annual investment
    performance for one particular year does not, by itself,
    significantly influence our evaluation.

The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit
    obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal
    is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate
    level of risk. The defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset
    classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further
    diversified across investment styles and investment
    organizations. For the defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy
    allocations are: 30 percent to equities in the United
    States; 20 percent to international equities;
    10 percent to private equities; 30 percent to fixed
    income; and 10 percent to real assets (real estate, energy
    and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may
    vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on
    relative market valuations.

Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates)
    for our United States defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plan assets were 4 percent, 15 percent,
    10 percent, 11 percent, and 12 percent for the 1,
    5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 25, 2008.

For fiscal 2008, we assumed, on a weighted-average basis for all
    defined benefit plans, a rate of return of 9.4 percent. For
    fiscal 2007, we assumed, on a weighted-average basis for all
    defined benefit plans, a rate of return of 9.4 percent. For
    fiscal 2006, we assumed, on a weighted-average basis for all
    defined benefit plan assets, a rate of return of
    9.6 percent. Our principal defined benefit pension and
    other postretirement plans in the United States have an expected
    return on plan assets of 9.6 percent. During fiscal 2007,
    we lowered the expected rate of return on one of our other
    postretirement plans in the United States based on costs
    associated with insurance contracts owned by that plan.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by
    50 basis points would increase our net pension and
    postretirement expense by $21 million for fiscal 2009. A
    50 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual
    rate of return on plan assets for fiscal 2009 would result in a
    similar amount of arising asset-experience loss. Any arising
    asset-experience loss is recognized on a market-related
    valuation basis, which reduces year-to-year volatility. This
    market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses
    over a five-year period from the year in which they occur.
    Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference
    between the expected return calculated using the market-related
    value of assets and the actual return based on the
    market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value
    of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period,
    the future value of assets will be impacted as previously
    deferred gains or losses are recorded. Our outside actuaries
    perform these calculations as part of our determination of
    annual expense or income.

Discount Rates

Our discount rate assumptions
    are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year
    for all of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement,
    and postemployment benefit plan obligations. Those same discount
    rates also are used to determine defined benefit pension, other
    postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income and
    expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our
    actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future
    cash outflows to plan participants and, using the top quartile
    of AA-rated corporate bond yields, to develop a forward interest
    rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit
    risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our
    expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate
    assumptions.

Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows:

Lowering the discount rates by 50 basis points would
    increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement,
    and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2009 by
    approximately $18 million. All obligation-related
    experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line
    method over the average remaining service period of active plan
    participants.



Health Care Cost Trend Rates

We review our
    health care trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we
    collect about our health care claims experience and information
    provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan
    experience, plan design, overall industry experience and
    projections, and assumptions used by other similar
    organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is
    adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review,
    recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial
    health care cost trend rate assumption is 10.25 percent for
    retirees age 65 and over and 9.25 percent for retirees
    under age 65. These rates are graded down annually until
    the ultimate trend rate of 5.2 percent is reached in 2016
    for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for
    calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a
    result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is
    adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current
    economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an
    appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for
    health care costs have an important effect on the amounts
    reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.

A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate
    would have the following effects:

    Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using
    a straight-line method over 15 years, resulting in at least
    the minimum amortization required being recorded.

Financial Statement Impact

In fiscal 2008, we
    recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and
    postemployment benefit plan expense of $18.9 million
    compared to $36.2 million in fiscal 2007 and
    $29.7 million in fiscal 2006. As of May 25, 2008, we
    had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of
    $276.8 million on our defined benefit pension plans,
    $115.6 million on our other postretirement benefit plans,
    and $8.0 million on our postemployment benefit plans,
    mainly as the result of decreases in our discount rate
    assumptions. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result
    in decreases in our future pension income and increases in
    postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors
    defined by GAAP.

We use the Retirement Plans (RP) 2000 Mortality Table projected
    forward to our plans’ measurement dates for calculating the
    year end defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and
    postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense.

Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement,
    and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on
    investment performance, changes in future discount rates,
    changes in health care trend rates, and various other factors
    related to the populations participating in these plans.

RECENTLY
    ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In April 2008, the FASB finalized Staff Position

No. 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets”

(FSP 142-3).

This position amends the factors that should be considered in
    developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine
    the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under
    SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets”.

FSP 142-3

applies to intangible assets that are acquired individually or
    with a group of other assets and both intangible assets acquired
    in business combinations and asset acquisitions. This position
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are
    evaluating the impact of

FSP 142-3

on our results of operations and financial condition.

In March 2008, the FASB approved the issuance of Emerging Issues
    Task Force Issue

No. 07-5,

“Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is
    Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock”

(EITF 07-5).

EITF 07-5

defines when adjustment features within contracts are considered
    to be equity-indexed and will be effective for us in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2010. We are evaluating the impact of

EITF 07-5

on our results of operations and financial condition.

In December 2007, the FASB approved the issuance of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141 (revised
    2007), “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141R).
    SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how
    the acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures
    in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired,
    the liabilities assumed, and any controlling interest;
    recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business
    combination or a gain from



a bargain purchase; and determines what information to disclose
    to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the
    nature and financial effects of the business combination.
    SFAS 141R applies to business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is on or after December 15, 2008.
    SFAS 141R also changes the accounting for
    acquisition-related tax contingencies, requiring all such
    changes in these contingency reserves to be recorded in earnings
    after the effective date. We have significant unrecognized tax
    positions related to our acquisition of Pillsbury. Adjustments
    to these liabilities after the adoption of SFAS 141R could
    be material to our net earnings.

In December 2007, the FASB approved the issuance of
    SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment to
    ARB No. 51” (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes
    accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership
    interest in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent
    be clearly identified and presented in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets within equity, but separate from the parent’s
    equity; the amount of consolidated net income attributable to
    the parent and the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified
    and presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of
    Earnings; and changes in a parent’s ownership interest
    while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in
    its subsidiary be accounted for consistently. This statement is
    effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008, which for us is the first quarter of
    fiscal 2010. We are evaluating the impact of SFAS 160 on
    our results of operations and financial condition.

In June 2007, the FASB approved the issuance of Emerging Issues
    Task Force Issue

No. 06-11,

“Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
    Share-Based Payment Awards”

(EITF 06-11).

EITF 06-11

requires that tax benefits from dividends paid on unvested
    restricted shares be charged directly to stockholders’
    equity instead of benefiting income tax expense.

EITF 06-11,

which will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal
    2009, is expected to increase our effective income tax rate by
    20 basis points, or from 34.4 percent to
    34.6 percent based on our actual 2008 effective tax rate.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities – Including an Amendment of
    SFAS No. 115” (SFAS 159). This statement
    provides companies with an option to measure, at specified
    election dates, many financial instruments and certain other
    items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair
    value. A company that adopts SFAS 159 will report
    unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value
    option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting
    date. This statement also establishes presentation and
    disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons
    between entities that choose different measurement attributes
    for similar types of assets and liabilities. This statement is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We do
    not believe that the adoption of SFAS 159 will have a
    material impact on our results of operations or financial
    condition.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157). This
    statement provides a single definition of fair value, a
    framework for measuring fair value, and expanded disclosures
    concerning fair value. Previously, different definitions of fair
    value were contained in various accounting pronouncements
    creating inconsistencies in measurement and disclosures.
    SFAS 157 applies under those previously issued
    pronouncements that prescribe fair value as the relevant measure
    of value, except SFAS 123R and related interpretations and
    pronouncements that require or permit measurement similar to
    fair value but are not intended to measure fair value. This
    pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, which for us is the first quarter of
    fiscal 2009. However, SFAS 157 as it relates to fair value
    measurement requirements for non-financial assets and
    liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring
    basis is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2008, which for us is the first quarter of
    fiscal 2010. We are evaluating the impact of SFAS 157 on
    our results of operations and financial condition.

NON-GAAP
    MEASURES

We have included in this report measures of financial
    performance that are not defined by GAAP. For each of these
    non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a
    reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure
    and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of
    why our management or the Board of Directors believes the
    non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors, and
    any additional purposes for which our management or Board of
    Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures
    should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the
    comparable GAAP measure.



Total Segment Operating
    Profit

This non-GAAP measure is used in
    reporting to our executive management and as a component of the
    Board of Directors’ measurement of our performance for
    incentive compensation purposes. Management and the Board of
    Directors believe that this measure provides useful information
    to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to
    evaluate segment performance. A reconciliation of this measure
    to operating profit, the relevant GAAP measure, is included in
    Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this report.

Return on Average Total
    Capital

This ratio is not defined by GAAP,
    and is used in internal management reporting and as a component
    of the Board of Directors’ rating of our performance for
    incentive compensation purposes. Management and the Board of
    Directors believe that this measure provides useful information
    to investors because it is important for assessing the
    utilization of capital.

CAUTIONARY
    STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE
    PURPOSE OF “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE
    SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

This report contains or incorporates by reference
    forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on our
    current expectations and assumptions. We also may make written
    or oral forward-looking statements, including statements
    contained in our filings with the SEC and in our reports to
    stockholders.

The words or phrases “will likely result,” “are
    expected to,” “will continue,” “is
    anticipated,” “estimate,” “plan,”
    “project,” or similar expressions identify
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
    statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that
    could cause actual results to differ materially from historical
    results and those currently anticipated or projected. We wish to
    caution you not to place undue reliance on any such
    forward-looking statements.

In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are
    identifying important factors that could affect our financial
    performance and could cause our actual results in future periods
    to differ materially from any current opinions or statements.

Our future results could be affected by a variety of factors,
    such as: competitive dynamics in the consumer foods industry and
    the markets for our products, including new product
    introductions, advertising activities, pricing actions, and
    promotional activities of our competitors; economic conditions,
    including changes in inflation rates, interest rates, or tax
    rates; product development and innovation; consumer acceptance
    of new products and product improvements; consumer reaction to
    pricing actions and



changes in promotion levels; acquisitions or dispositions of
    businesses or assets; changes in capital structure; changes in
    laws and regulations, including labeling and advertising
    regulations; impairments in the carrying value of goodwill,
    other intangible assets, or other long-lived assets, or changes
    in the useful lives of other intangible assets; changes in
    accounting standards and the impact of significant accounting
    estimates; product quality and safety issues, including recalls
    and product liability; changes in consumer demand for our
    products; effectiveness of advertising, marketing, and
    promotional programs; changes in consumer behavior, trends, and
    preferences, including weight loss trends; consumer perception
    of health-related issues, including obesity; consolidation in
    the retail environment; changes in purchasing and inventory
    levels of significant customers; fluctuations in the cost and
    availability of supply chain resources, including raw materials,
    packaging, and energy; disruptions or inefficiencies in the
    supply chain; volatility in the market value of derivatives used
    to hedge price risk for certain commodities; benefit plan
    expenses due to changes in plan asset values and discount rates
    used to determine plan liabilities; failure of our information
    technology systems; resolution of uncertain income tax matters;
    foreign economic conditions, including currency rate
    fluctuations; and political unrest in foreign markets and
    economic uncertainty due to terrorism or war.

You should also consider the risk factors that we identify in
    Item 1A of this report, which could also affect our future
    results.

We undertake no obligation to publicly revise any
    forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
    after the date of those statements or to reflect the occurrence
    of anticipated or unanticipated events.



ITEM 7A

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest
    rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity
    prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our
    earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we
    actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering
    into various hedging transactions, authorized under established
    policies that place clear controls on these activities. The
    counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated
    institutions. We establish credit limits for each counterparty.
    Our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a
    variety of derivative financial instruments.

INTEREST
    RATE RISK

We are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future
    issuances of fixed-rate debt, and existing and future issuances
    of floating-rate debt. Primary exposures include
    U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR, and commercial paper rates in
    the United States and Europe. We use interest rate swaps and
    forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to
    interest rate changes, to reduce the volatility of our financing
    costs, and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed- versus
    floating-rate debt, based on current and projected market
    conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a
    counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and
    floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional
    principal amount. As of May 25, 2008, we had
    $4.1 billion of aggregate notional principal amount
    outstanding, with a net notional amount of $425.4 million
    that converts floating-rate notes to fixed-rates. This includes
    notional amounts of offsetting swaps that neutralize our
    exposure to interest rates on other interest rate swaps.

FOREIGN
    EXCHANGE RISK

Foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in
    foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to
    third party purchases, intercompany loans, and product
    shipments. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign
    currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. Our principal
    exposures are to the Australian dollar, British pound sterling,
    Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, and
    Mexican peso. We mainly use foreign currency forward contracts
    to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures.
    We generally do not hedge more than 12 months forward and
    generally do not hedge intercompany transactions. We also have
    many net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are
    denominated in euros. We hedge a portion of these net
    investments by issuing euro-denominated commercial paper. As of
    May 25, 2008, we had issued $472.9 million of
    euro-denominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward
    contracts that we have designated as a net investment hedge and
    thus deferred net foreign currency transaction losses of
    $69.6 million to accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss).

COMMODITY
    PRICE RISK

Many commodities we use in the production and distribution of
    our products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize
    derivatives to hedge price risk for our principal ingredient and
    energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils
    (principally soybean), non-fat dry milk, natural gas, and diesel
    fuel. We manage our exposures through a combination of purchase
    orders, long-term contracts with suppliers, exchange-traded
    futures and options, and over-the-counter options and swaps. We
    offset our exposures based on current and projected market
    conditions, and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close
    to our planned cost as possible. As of May 25, 2008, the
    net notional value of commodity derivatives was
    $784.8 million, of which $524.8 million relates to
    agricultural positions and $260.0 million relates to energy
    positions. These hedges relate to inputs that generally will be
    utilized within the next 12 months.

EQUITY
    INSTRUMENTS

Equity price movements affect our compensation expense as
    certain investments owned by our employees related to our
    deferred compensation plan are revalued. We use equity swaps to
    manage this market risk.

VALUE
    AT RISK

The estimates in the table below are intended to measure the
    maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from
    adverse changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange
    rates, commodity prices, and equity prices under normal market
    conditions. A Monte Carlo

value-at-risk

(VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our
    exposures. The models assumed normal market conditions and used
    a 95 percent confidence level.

The VAR calculation used historical interest rates, foreign
    exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices from the past



year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of
    these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the
    RiskMetrics

tm

data set. The calculations are not intended to represent actual
    losses in fair value that we expect to incur. Further, since the
    hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with
    the underlying exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain
    in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset
    by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying
    exposures. The positions included in the calculations were:
    debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange
    forwards; commodity swaps, futures and options; and equity
    instruments. The calculations do not include the underlying
    foreign exchange and commodities-related positions that are
    hedged by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.

The table below presents the estimated maximum potential VAR
    arising from a

one-day

loss
    in fair value for our interest rate, foreign currency,
    commodity, and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments
    outstanding as of May 25, 2008, and May 27, 2007, and
    the average fair value impact during the year ended May 25,
    2008.

    The statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
    principles that are generally accepted in the United States,
    using management’s best estimates and judgments where
    appropriate. The financial information throughout this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

is consistent with our consolidated financial statements.

Management has established a system of internal controls that
    provides reasonable assurance that assets are adequately
    safeguarded and transactions are recorded accurately in all
    material respects, in accordance with management’s
    authorization. We maintain a strong audit program that
    independently evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of
    internal controls. Our internal controls provide for appropriate
    separation of duties and responsibilities, and there are
    documented policies regarding use of our assets and proper
    financial reporting. These formally stated and regularly
    communicated policies demand highly ethical conduct from all
    employees.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets regularly
    with management, internal auditors, and our independent auditors
    to review internal control, auditing, and financial reporting
    matters. The independent auditors, internal auditors, and
    employees have full and free access to the Audit Committee at
    any time.

The Audit Committee reviewed and approved the Company’s
    annual financial statements. The Audit Committee recommended,
    and the Board of Directors approved, that the consolidated
    financial statements be included in the Annual Report. The Audit
    Committee also appointed KPMG LLP to serve as the Company’s
    independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2009,
    subject to ratification by the stockholders at the annual
    meeting.

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

General Mills, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 25, 2008,
    and May 27, 2007, and the related consolidated statements
    of earnings, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income,
    and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year
    period ended May 25, 2008. In connection with our audits of
    the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
    accompanying financial statement schedule. We also have audited
    General Mills Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of May 25, 2008, based on criteria established
    in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO). General Mills, Inc.’s
    management is responsible for these consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
    and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements
    included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
    amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
    the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered



necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    May 25, 2008, and May 27, 2007, and the results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal
    years in the three-year period ended May 25, 2008, in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the accompanying
    financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
    basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein. Also in our opinion, General Mills, Inc.
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of May 25, 2008, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In fiscal 2008, as disclosed in Note 14 to the consolidated
    financial statements, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes – an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109” on May 28, 2007. In fiscal 2007, as
    disclosed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its classification of shipping
    costs, changed its annual goodwill impairment assessment date to
    December 1, and adopted SFAS No. 123 (Revised),
    “Share-Based Payment”, and SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Benefit Plans an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)”.

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements

GENERAL MILLS, INC.
    AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTE 1. BASIS
    OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASSIFICATIONS

Basis of
    Presentation

Our Consolidated Financial
    Statements include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all
    subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest.
    Intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in
    consolidation.

Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in May. Fiscal years
    2008, 2007, and 2006 each consisted of 52 weeks. Financial
    results for our International segment, with the exception of
    Canada, its export operations, and its United States and Latin
    American headquarters are reported as of and for the 12 calendar
    months ended April 30.

Reclassifications

During
    fiscal 2007, we made certain changes in our reporting of
    financial information. The effects of these reclassifications on
    our historical Consolidated Financial Statements are reflected
    herein and had no impact on our consolidated net earnings or
    earnings per share (EPS).

We made a change in accounting principle to classify shipping
    costs associated with the distribution of finished products to
    our customers as cost of sales. We previously recorded these
    costs in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A)
    expense. We made this change in principle because we believe the
    classification of these shipping costs in cost of sales better
    reflects the cost of producing and distributing our products and
    aligns our external financial reporting with the results we use
    internally to evaluate segment operating performance. The impact
    of this change in principle was an increase to cost of sales of
    $474.4 million in fiscal 2006, and a corresponding decrease
    to SG&A expense in the same period.

We shifted sales responsibility for several customers from our
    Bakeries and Foodservice segment to our U.S. Retail
    segment. Net sales and segment operating profit for these two
    segments have been adjusted to report the results from shifted
    businesses within the appropriate segment. The impact of this
    shift was a decrease in net sales of our Bakeries and
    Foodservice segment and an increase in net sales of our
    U.S. Retail segment of $55.0 million in fiscal 2006.
    The impact of this shift was a decrease of Bakeries and
    Foodservice segment operating profit and an increase of
    U.S. Retail segment operating profit of $22.1 million
    in fiscal 2006.

We also reclassified (i) certain trade-related costs and
    customer allowances as cost of sales or SG&A expense
    (previously recorded as reductions of net sales),
    (ii) certain liabilities, including trade and consumer
    promotion accruals, from accounts payable to other current
    liabilities, (iii) certain distributions from joint
    ventures as operating cash flows (previously reported as
    investing cash flows), (iv) royalties from a joint venture
    to after-tax earnings from joint ventures (previously recorded
    as a reduction of SG&A expense), (v) certain
    receivables, including accrued interest, derivatives, and other
    miscellaneous receivables that were historically included in
    receivables, to other current assets, and (vi) valuation
    allowances related to deferred income tax assets between current
    and noncurrent classification. These reclassifications were not
    material individually or in the aggregate. We have reclassified
    previously reported Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated
    Statements of Earnings, and Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows to conform to the fiscal 2007 presentation.

In addition, certain reclassifications to our previously
    reported financial information have been made to conform to the
    current period presentation.

Change in Reporting
    Period

In fiscal 2007, we changed the
    reporting period for our Häagen-Dazs joint ventures in Asia
    to include results through March 31. In previous years, we
    included results for the twelve months ended April 30.
    Accordingly, fiscal 2007 results include only 11 months of
    results from these joint ventures compared to 12 months in
    fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2006. The impact of this change was not
    material to our results of operations, thus we did not restate
    prior period financial statements for comparability.

NOTE 2. SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

We consider all investments
    purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to
    be cash equivalents.

Inventories

All
    inventories in the United States other than grain and certain
    organic products are valued at the lower of cost, using the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method, or market. Grain inventories and all
    related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at market with
    all net changes in value recorded in earnings currently.
    Inventories outside of the United States are valued at the



lower of cost, using the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method, or market.

Shipping costs associated with the distribution of finished
    product to our customers are recorded as cost of sales and are
    recognized when the related finished product is shipped to and
    accepted by the customer.

Land, Buildings, Equipment,
    and Depreciation

Land is recorded at
    historical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized
    interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at cost
    and depreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the
    straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are
    charged to cost of sales. Buildings are usually depreciated over
    40 to 50 years, and equipment, furniture, and software are
    usually depreciated over 3 to 15 years. Fully depreciated
    assets are retained in buildings and equipment until disposal.
    When an item is sold or retired, the accounts are relieved of
    its cost and related accumulated depreciation; the resulting
    gains and losses, if any, are recognized in earnings. As of
    May 25, 2008, assets held for sale were insignificant.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
    asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment
    loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash
    flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are
    less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups
    have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of
    other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be
    based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group
    over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted
    cash flow model or independent appraisals, as appropriate.

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

Goodwill is not amortized, and is
    tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.
    Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units.
    We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including
    goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based
    on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of
    that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared
    or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount
    of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we revalue all
    assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, excluding
    goodwill, to determine if the fair value of the net assets is
    greater than the net assets including goodwill. If the fair
    value of the net assets is less than the net assets including
    goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value
    are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth
    rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our
    annual long-range planning process. We also make estimates of
    discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market
    comparables, and other factors.

We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets,
    primarily intangible assets associated with the

Pillsbury

,

Totino’s

,

Progresso

,

Green Giant

,

Old El Paso, Häagen-Dazs,

and

Uncle Tobys

brands, to determine if they are
    finite or indefinite-lived. We determine useful lives by
    considering future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition,
    other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry,
    known technological advances, legislative action that results in
    an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected
    changes in distribution channels), the level of required
    maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other
    related groups of assets.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily brands, also
    are tested for impairment annually, and whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may
    not be recoverable. We performed our fiscal 2008 assessment of
    our brand intangibles as of December 1, 2007. Our estimate
    of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash
    flow model using inputs which included: projected revenues from
    our annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates that could be
    payable if we did not own the brands; and a discount rate.

Investments in Joint
    Ventures

Our investments in companies over
    which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are
    stated at cost plus our share of undistributed earnings or
    losses. We receive royalty income from certain joint ventures,
    incur various expenses (primarily research and development), and
    record the tax impact of certain joint venture operations that
    are structured as partnerships. In addition, we make advances to
    our joint ventures in the form of loans or capital investments.
    We also sell certain raw materials, semi-finished goods, and
    finished goods to the joint ventures, generally at market prices.

Variable Interest
    Entities

As of May 25, 2008, we
    invested in 3 variable interest entities (VIEs). We have an
    interest in a contract



manufacturer at our former facility in Geneva, Illinois. We are
    the primary beneficiary (PB) and have consolidated this entity
    as of May 25, 2008. This entity had property and equipment
    with a carrying value of $31.0 million and long-term debt
    of $31.8 million as of May 25, 2008. We also have an
    interest in a contract manufacturer in Greece that is a VIE.
    Although we are the PB, we have not consolidated this entity
    because it is not material to our results of operations,
    financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the year ended
    May 25, 2008. This entity had assets of $4.2 million
    and liabilities of $0.9 million as of May 25, 2008. We
    are not the PB of the remaining VIE. Our maximum exposure to
    loss from the 3 VIEs is limited to the $31.8 million of
    long-term debt of the contract manufacturer in Geneva, Illinois
    and our $1.1 million equity investment in the VIE of which
    we are not the PB.

Revenue
    Recognition

We recognize sales revenue when
    the shipment is accepted by our customer. Sales include shipping
    and handling charges billed to the customer and are reported net
    of consumer coupon redemption, trade promotion and other costs,
    including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product,
    and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use, value-added, and other
    excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. Coupons are recorded
    when distributed, based on estimated redemption rates. Trade
    promotions are recorded based on estimated participation and
    performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. We
    generally do not allow a right of return. However, on a limited

case-by-case

basis with prior approval, we may allow customers to return
    product. In limited circumstances, product returned in saleable
    condition is resold to other customers or outlets. Receivables
    from customers generally do not bear interest. Terms and
    collection patterns vary around the world and by channel. The
    allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of
    probable non-payments and credit losses in our existing
    receivables, as determined based on a review of past due
    balances and other specific account data. Account balances are
    written off against the allowance when we deem the amount is
    uncollectible.

Environmental

Environmental
    costs relating to existing conditions caused by past operations
    that do not contribute to current or future revenues are
    expensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation
    costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are
    probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the
    completion of feasibility studies or our commitment to a plan of
    action.

Advertising Production
    Costs

We expense the production costs of
    advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.

Research and
    Development

All expenditures for research
    and development (R&D) are charged against earnings in the
    year incurred. R&D includes expenditures for new product
    and manufacturing process innovation, and the annual
    expenditures are comprised primarily of internal salaries,
    wages, consulting, and other supplies attributable to time spent
    on R&D activities. Other costs include depreciation and
    maintenance of research facilities, including assets at
    facilities that are engaged in pilot plant activities.

Foreign Currency
    Translation

For all significant foreign
    operations, the functional currency is the local currency.
    Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the
    period-end exchange rates. Income statement accounts are
    translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during
    the year. Translation adjustments are reflected within
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
    stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign
    currency transactions are included in net earnings for the
    period except for gains and losses on investments in
    subsidiaries for which settlement is not planned for the
    foreseeable future and foreign exchange gains and losses on
    instruments designated as net investment hedges. These gains and
    losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss).

Derivative
    Instruments

Application of hedge accounting
    under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
    No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities,” as amended (SFAS 133), requires
    significant resources, recordkeeping, and analytical systems. As
    a result of the rising compliance costs and the complexity
    associated with the application of hedge accounting, we elected
    to discontinue the use of hedge accounting for all commodity
    derivative positions entered into after the beginning of fiscal
    2008. Accordingly, the changes in the values of these
    derivatives are recorded currently in cost of sales in our
    Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Regardless of designation for accounting purposes, we believe
    all our commodity derivatives are economic hedges of our risk



exposures, and as a result we consider these derivatives to be
    hedges for purposes of measuring segment operating performance.
    Thus, these gains and losses are reported in unallocated
    corporate items outside of segment operating results until such
    time that the exposure we are hedging affects earnings. At that
    time we reclassify the hedge gain or loss from unallocated
    corporate items to segment operating profit, allowing our
    operating segments to realize the economic effects of the hedge
    without experiencing any resulting

mark-to-market

volatility, which remains in unallocated corporate items.

We also use derivatives to hedge our exposure to changes in
    foreign exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are
    recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value
    based on quoted market prices or management’s estimate of
    their fair value and are recorded in either current or
    noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity.
    Changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded in net
    earnings or other comprehensive income, based on whether the
    instrument is designated as a hedge transaction and, if so, the
    type of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative
    instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) are reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged
    item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction
    ceases to exist, any associated amounts reported in accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings
    at that time. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings in
    the current period.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Effective May 29, 2006, we
    adopted SFAS No. 123 (Revised), “Share-Based
    Payment” (SFAS 123R), which changed the accounting for
    compensation expense associated with stock options, restricted
    stock awards, and other forms of equity compensation. We elected
    the modified prospective transition method as permitted by
    SFAS 123R; accordingly, results from prior periods have not
    been restated. Under this method, stock-based compensation
    expense for fiscal 2007 was $127.1 million, which included
    amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of all
    equity compensation awards granted prior to May 29, 2006,
    based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
    the original provisions of SFAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
    (SFAS 123), and amortization related to all equity
    compensation awards granted on or subsequent to May 29,
    2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance
    with the provisions of SFAS 123R. The incremental effect on
    net earnings in fiscal 2007 of our adoption of SFAS 123R
    was $68.8 million of expense ($42.9 million
    after-tax). All of our stock compensation expense is recorded in
    SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and
    in unallocated corporate items in our segment results.

SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in
    excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a
    financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as
    previously required, thereby reducing net operating cash flows
    and increasing net financing cash flows in periods following
    adoption.

Certain equity-based compensation plans contain provisions that
    accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, disability, or
    death of eligible employees and directors. SFAS 123R
    specifies that a stock-based award is vested when the
    employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent
    on providing subsequent service. Accordingly, beginning in
    fiscal 2007, we prospectively revised our expense attribution
    method so that the related compensation cost is recognized
    immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible
    individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date
    retirement eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated
    vesting period. For fiscal 2006, we generally recognized stock
    compensation expense over the stated vesting period of the
    award, with any unamortized expense recognized immediately if an
    acceleration event occurred.

Prior to May 29, 2006, we used the intrinsic value method
    for measuring the cost of compensation paid in our common stock.
    No compensation expense for stock options was recognized in our
    Consolidated Statements of Earnings prior to fiscal 2007, as the
    exercise price was equal to the market price of our stock at the
    date of grant. Expense attributable to other types of
    share-based awards was recognized in our results under
    SFAS 123.

The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net
    earnings and EPS for fiscal 2006 if we had applied the fair
    value



recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to all employee
    stock-based compensation, net of estimated forfeitures:

Defined Benefit Pension,
    Other Postretirement, and Postemployment Benefit
    Plans

We sponsor several domestic and
    foreign defined benefit plans to provide pension, health care,
    and other welfare benefits to retired employees. Under certain
    circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits to former or
    inactive employees in the United States and Canada and members
    of our Board of Directors, including severance and certain other
    benefits payable upon death. We recognize an obligation for any
    of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service.
    Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with
    service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather
    than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our
    postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.

We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined
    benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability and
    recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the
    changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss), which is a component of stockholders’ equity.

Use of
    Estimates

Preparing our Consolidated
    Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States requires us to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets
    and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from our estimates.

Other New Accounting
    Standards

In fiscal 2008, we adopted Staff
    Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the
    Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
    Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements”
    (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on
    the process and diversity in practice of quantifying financial
    statement misstatements resulting in the potential carryover of
    improper amounts on the balance sheet. The SEC believes that
    registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet
    and income statement approach and evaluate whether either
    approach results in quantifying a misstatement that, when all
    relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is
    material. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material
    impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

Also in fiscal 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 155,
    “Hybrid Instruments” (SFAS 155). SFAS 155
    amends SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities” and
    SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities.” SFAS 155 is effective for all financial
    instruments acquired or issued after May 27, 2007. The
    adoption of SFAS 155 did not have any impact on our results
    of operations or financial condition.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) ratified the consensus of Emerging Issues Task Force
    Issue

No. 06-5,

“Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance-Determining the
    Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical

Bulletin No. 85-4”

(EITF 06-5).

EITF 06-5

requires that a policyholder consider any additional amounts
    included in the contractual terms of the policy in determining
    the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract
    on a policy by policy basis. We adopted

EITF 06-5

in fiscal 2008, and it did not have any impact on our results of
    operations or financial condition.

In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus of Emerging Issues
    Task Force Issue

No. 06-3,

“How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
    Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
    Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation)”

(EITF 06-3).

EITF 06-3

concluded that the presentation of taxes imposed on
    revenue-producing transactions (sales, use, value added, and
    excise taxes) on either a gross (included in revenues and costs)
    or a net (excluded from revenues) basis is an accounting policy
    that should be disclosed. We adopted

EITF 06-3

in fiscal 2007, and it did not have any impact on our results of
    operations or financial condition.



In fiscal 2007, we adopted SFAS No. 151,
    “Inventory Costs – An Amendment of ARB
    No. 43, Chapter 4” (SFAS 151). SFAS 151
    clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility
    expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material
    (spoilage). The adoption of SFAS 151 did not have any
    impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

In fiscal 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 153,
    “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets – An Amendment
    of APB Opinion No. 29” (SFAS 153). SFAS 153
    eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for
    nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces
    it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial
    substance. The adoption of SFAS 153 did not have any impact
    on our results of operations or financial condition.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 47,
    “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations” (FIN 47). FIN 47 requires that
    liabilities be recognized for the fair value of a legal
    obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are
    conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably
    estimated. We adopted FIN 47 in fiscal 2006, and it did not
    have a material impact on our results of operations or financial
    condition.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS
    AND DIVESTITURES

Subsequent to our fiscal 2008 year-end, we acquired Humm Foods,
    Inc. (Humm), the maker of

Lärabar

fruit-and-nut

energy bars. We issued 0.9 million shares of our common
    stock to the shareholders of Humm as consideration for the
    acquisition.

During fiscal 2008, the 8th Continent soymilk business was sold.
    Our 50 percent share of the after-tax gain on the sale was
    $2.2 million, of which we recognized $1.7 million in
    after-tax earnings from joint ventures in fiscal 2008. We will
    record an additional after-tax gain of up to $0.5 million
    in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 if certain conditions are
    satisfied. Also during fiscal 2008, we acquired a controlling
    interest in HD Distributors (Thailand) Company Limited. Prior to
    acquiring the controlling interest, we accounted for our
    investment as a joint venture. The purchase price, net of cash
    acquired, resulted in a $1.3 million cash inflow classified
    in acquisitions on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

During fiscal 2007, we sold our Bakeries and Foodservice frozen
    pie product line, including a plant in Rochester, New York. We
    received $1.2 million in proceeds and recorded a
    $3.6 million loss on the sale. We also sold our Bakeries
    and Foodservice par-baked bread product line, including plants
    in Chelsea, Massachusetts and Tempe, Arizona. We received
    $12.5 million in proceeds and recorded a $6.0 million
    loss on the sale in fiscal 2007, including the write off of
    $6.2 million of goodwill.

During fiscal 2007, we completed the acquisition of Saxby Bros.
    Limited, a chilled pastry company in the United Kingdom, for
    approximately $24.1 million. This business, which had sales
    of $23.8 million in calendar 2006, complements our existing
    frozen pastry business in the United Kingdom. In addition, we
    completed an acquisition in Greece for $2.8 million.

During fiscal 2007, our 50 percent joint venture Cereal
    Partners Worldwide (CPW) completed the acquisition of the Uncle
    Tobys cereal business in Australia for $385.6 million. We
    funded our 50 percent share of the purchase price by making
    additional advances to and equity contributions in CPW totaling
    $135.1 million (classified as investments in affiliates,
    net, on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows) and by
    acquiring a 50 percent undivided interest in certain
    intellectual property for $57.7 million (classified as
    acquisitions on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows).
    During fiscal 2008, we completed the allocation of our purchase
    price and reclassified $16.3 million from goodwill to other
    intangible assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

During fiscal 2006, we acquired Elysées Consult SAS, the
    franchise operator of a

Häagen-Dazs

shop in France,
    and Croissant King, a producer of frozen pastry products in
    Australia. We also acquired a controlling financial interest in
    Pinedale Holdings Pte. Limited, an operator of

Häagen-Dazs

cafes in Singapore and Malaysia. The
    aggregate purchase price of our fiscal 2006 acquisitions was
    $26.5 million.

NOTE 4. RESTRUCTURING,
    IMPAIRMENT, AND OTHER EXIT COSTS

We view our restructuring activities as a way to meet our
    long-term growth targets. Activities we undertake must meet
    internal rate of return and net present value targets. Each
    restructuring action normally takes one to two years to
    complete. At completion (or as each major stage is completed in
    the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver
    cash savings

and/or

reduced depreciation. These activities result in various
    restructuring costs, including asset write offs, exit charges
    including severance, contract termination fees, and
    decommissioning and other costs.



In fiscal 2008, we recorded restructuring, impairment, and other
    exit costs pursuant to approved plans as follows:

Expense (Income), in Millions

Closure of Poplar, Wisconsin plant

$

2.7

Closure and sale of Allentown, Pennsylvania frozen waffle plant

We approved a plan to transfer

Old El Paso

production from our Poplar, Wisconsin facility to other
    plants and close the Poplar facility to improve capacity
    utilization and reduce costs. This action affects
    113 employees at the Poplar facility and resulted in a
    charge of $2.7 million consisting entirely of employee
    severance. Due to declining financial results, we decided to
    exit our frozen waffle product line (retail and foodservice) and
    to close our frozen waffle plant in Allentown, Pennsylvania,
    affecting 111 employees. We recorded a charge consisting of
    $3.5 million of employee severance and a $5.9 million
    non-cash impairment charge against long-lived assets at the
    plant. We also completed an analysis of the viability of our
    Bakeries and Foodservice frozen dough facility in Trenton,
    Ontario, and decided to close the facility, affecting
    470 employees. We recorded a charge consisting of
    $8.4 million for employee severance and $2.5 million
    in charges for shutdown and decommissioning costs. We lease the
    Trenton plant under an agreement expiring in fiscal 2013. We
    expect to make limited use of the plant during fiscal 2009 while
    we evaluate sublease or lease termination options. These
    actions, including the anticipated timing of the disposition of
    the plants we will close, are expected to be completed by the
    end of the third quarter of fiscal 2009. We also restructured
    our production scheduling and discontinued our cake production
    line at our Chanhassen, Minnesota Bakeries and Foodservice
    plant. These actions affected 125 employees, and we
    recorded a $3.0 million charge for employee severance that
    was partially offset by a $1.4 million gain from the sale
    of long-lived assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.
    This action is expected to be completed by the end of the first
    quarter of fiscal 2009. Finally, we recorded additional charges
    of $3.5 million primarily related to previously announced
    Bakeries and Foodservice segment restructuring actions including
    employee severance for 38 employees.

Collectively, the charges we expect to incur with respect to
    these fiscal 2008 restructuring actions total $65 million,
    of which $43.3 million has been recognized in fiscal 2008.
    This includes a $17.7 million non-cash charge related to
    accelerated depreciation on long-lived assets at our plant in
    Trenton, Ontario and $0.8 million of inventory write offs
    at our plants in Chanhassen, Minnesota and Allentown,
    Pennsylvania. The accelerated depreciation charge is recorded in
    cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in
    unallocated corporate items in our segment results.

During fiscal 2008, we received $16.2 million in proceeds
    from the sale of our Allentown, Pennsylvania plant and our
    previously closed Vallejo, California plant.

In fiscal 2007, we recorded restructuring, impairment, and other
    exit costs pursuant to approved plans as follows:

As part of our long-range planning process, we determined that
    certain product lines in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment
    were underperforming. In late May 2007, we concluded that the
    future cash flows generated by these product lines will be
    insufficient to recover the net book value of the related
    long-lived assets. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash
    impairment charge of $36.7 million against these assets in
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.

In fiscal 2006, we recorded restructuring, impairment, and other
    exit costs pursuant to approved plans as follows:

The fiscal 2006 initiatives were undertaken to increase asset

    decisions to: close our leased frozen dough foodservice plant in
    Swedesboro, New Jersey, affecting 101 employees; shut down
    a portion of our frozen dough foodservice plant in Montreal,
    Quebec, affecting 77 employees; realign and modify product
    and manufacturing capabilities at our frozen waffle plant in
    Allentown, Pennsylvania, affecting 72 employees; and
    complete the fiscal 2005 initiative to relocate our frozen baked
    goods line from our plant in Chelsea, Massachusetts, affecting
    175 employees.

NOTE 5. INVESTMENTS
    IN JOINT VENTURES

We have a 50 percent equity interest in CPW which
    manufactures and markets

ready-to-eat

cereal products in more than 130 countries and republics outside
    the United States and Canada. CPW also markets cereal bars in
    several European countries and manufactures private label
    cereals for customers in the United Kingdom. We have guaranteed
    a portion of CPW’s debt and its pension obligation in the
    United Kingdom. Results from our CPW joint venture are reported
    as of and for the 12 months ended March 31.

We have 50 percent equity interests in Häagen-Dazs
    Japan, Inc. and Häagen-Dazs Korea Company Limited. These
    joint ventures manufacture, distribute, and market

Häagen-Dazs

ice cream products and frozen novelties.
    In fiscal 2007, we changed their reporting period to include
    results through March 31. In previous years, we included
    results for the twelve months ended April 30. Accordingly,
    fiscal 2007 results include only 11 months of results from
    these joint ventures compared to 12 months in fiscal 2008
    and fiscal 2006. The impact of this change was not material to
    our consolidated results of operations, so we did not restate
    prior periods for comparability.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the 8th Continent
    soymilk business was sold. Our 50 percent share of the
    after-tax gain on the sale was $2.2 million, of which we
    recognized $1.7 million in after-tax earnings from joint
    ventures in fiscal 2008. We will record an additional after-tax
    gain of up to $0.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal
    2010 if certain conditions are satisfied.

In February 2006, CPW announced a restructuring of its
    manufacturing plants in the United Kingdom. Our after-tax share
    of CPW restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs pursuant
    to approved plans during fiscal 2008 and prior years was as
    follows:

During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, CPW acquired the Uncle
    Tobys cereal business in Australia for $385.6 million. We
    funded advances and an equity contribution to CPW from cash
    generated from our international operations, including our
    international joint ventures.

Our cumulative investment in these joint ventures was
    $278.6 million at the end of fiscal 2008 and
    $294.6 million at the end of fiscal 2007. We also have
    goodwill of $577.0 million associated with our joint
    ventures. Our investments in these joint ventures include
    aggregate advances of $124.4 million as of May 25,
    2008 and $157.1 million as of May 27, 2007. Our sales
    to these joint ventures were $12.8 million in fiscal 2008,
    $31.8 million in fiscal 2007, and $34.8 million in
    fiscal 2006. We had a net return of capital from the joint
    ventures of $75.2 million in fiscal 2008 and made net
    investments of $103.4 million in fiscal 2007 and
    $7.0 million in fiscal 2006. We received dividends from the
    joint ventures of $108.7 million in fiscal 2008,
    $45.2 million in fiscal 2007, and $77.4 million in
    fiscal 2006.

During fiscal 2007 as part of our annual goodwill and brand
    intangible impairment assessments, we reviewed our goodwill and
    other intangible asset allocations by country within the
    International segment and our joint ventures. The resulting
    reallocation of these balances across the countries within this
    segment and to our joint ventures caused changes in the foreign
    currency translation of the balances. As a result of these
    changes in foreign currency translation, we increased goodwill
    by



$136.2 million, other intangible assets by
    $18.1 million, deferred income taxes by $9.2 million,
    and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by the net of
    these amounts.

At the beginning of fiscal 2007, we shifted selling
    responsibility for several customers from our Bakeries and
    Foodservice segment to our U.S. Retail segment. Goodwill of
    $216.0 million previously reported in our Bakeries and
    Foodservice segment as of May 28, 2006 has now been
    recorded in the U.S. Retail segment.

Future purchase price adjustments to goodwill may occur upon the
    resolution of certain income tax accounting matters.

Marketable securities with a market value of $12.6 million
    as of May 25, 2008 were pledged as collateral for certain
    derivative contracts.

The fair values and carrying amounts of long-term debt,
    including the current portion, were $4,926.3 million and
    $4,790.7 million as of May 25, 2008, and
    $4,977.8 million and $4,951.7 million as of
    May 27, 2007. The fair value of long-term debt was
    estimated using discounted cash flows based on our current
    incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments.

Risk Management
    Activities

As a part of our ongoing
    operations, we are exposed to market risks such as changes in
    interest rates,



foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. To manage
    these risks, we may enter into various derivative transactions
    (e.g., futures, options, and swaps) pursuant to our established
    policies.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest
    rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate
    debt, and existing and future issuances of floating-rate debt.
    Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates, London
    Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), and commercial paper rates in
    the United States and Europe. We use interest rate swaps and
    forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to
    interest rate changes, to reduce the volatility of our financing
    costs, and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed-rate versus
    floating-rate debt, based on current and projected market
    conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a
    counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and
    floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional
    principal amount.

Floating Interest Rate Exposures – Except as discussed
    below,

floating-to-fixed

interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, as
    are all hedges of forecasted issuances of debt. Effectiveness is
    assessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical
    derivative method or changes in the present value of interest
    payments on the underlying debt. Amounts deferred to accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified into earnings
    over the life of the associated debt. The amount of hedge
    ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in each of fiscal
    2008, 2007, and 2006.

Fixed Interest Rate Exposures –

Fixed-to-floating

interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges with
    effectiveness assessed based on changes in the fair value of the
    underlying debt, using incremental borrowing rates currently
    available on loans with similar terms and maturities. Effective
    gains and losses on these derivatives and the underlying hedged
    items are recorded as net interest. The amount of hedge
    ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in each of fiscal
    2008, 2007, and 2006.

In anticipation of the Pillsbury acquisition and other financing
    needs, we entered into pay-fixed interest rate swap contracts
    during fiscal 2001 and 2002 totaling $7.1 billion to lock
    in our interest payments on the associated debt. As of
    May 25, 2008, we still owned $1.75 billion of
    Pillsbury-related pay-fixed swaps that were previously
    neutralized with offsetting pay-floating swaps in fiscal 2002.

In advance of a planned debt financing in fiscal 2007, we
    entered into $700.0 million pay-fixed, forward-starting
    interest rate swaps with an average fixed rate of
    5.7 percent. All of these forward-starting interest rate
    swaps were cash settled for $22.5 million coincident with
    our $1.0 billion

10-year

fixed-rate note debt offering on January 17, 2007. As of
    May 25, 2008, $19.4 million pre-tax loss remained in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which will be
    reclassified to earnings over the term of the underlying debt.

The following table summarizes the notional amounts and
    weighted-average interest rates of our interest rate swaps. As
    discussed above, we have neutralized all of our
    Pillsbury-related pay-fixed swaps with pay-floating swaps;
    however, we cannot present them on a net basis in the following
    table because the offsetting occurred with different
    counterparties. Average floating rates are based on rates as of
    the end of the reporting period.

Foreign Exchange Risk

Foreign currency
    fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries
    and foreign currency cash flows related primarily to third-party
    purchases, intercompany loans, and product shipments. We are
    also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to
    the U.S. dollar. Our principal



exposures are to the Australian dollar, British pound sterling,
    Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen and
    Mexican peso. We primarily use foreign currency forward
    contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow
    exposures. We generally do not hedge more than 12 months
    forward. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was $1 million
    or less in each of fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006. We also have
    many net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are
    denominated in euros. We hedge a portion of these net
    investments by issuing euro-denominated commercial paper and
    foreign exchange forward contracts. As of May 25, 2008, we
    have issued $472.9 million of euro-denominated commercial
    paper and foreign exchange forward contracts that we have
    designated as a net investment hedge and thus deferred net
    foreign currency transaction losses of $69.6 million to
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Commodity Price Risk

Many commodities we use
    in the production and distribution of our products are exposed
    to market price risks. We use derivatives to hedge price risk
    for our principal raw materials and energy input costs including
    grains (wheat, oats, and corn), oils (principally soybean),
    non-fat dry milk, natural gas, and diesel fuel. We also operate
    a grain merchandising operation, primarily for wheat and oats.
    This operation uses futures and options to hedge its net
    inventory position to minimize market exposure. We manage our
    exposures through a combination of purchase orders, long-term
    contracts with suppliers, exchange-traded futures and options,
    and

over-the-counter

options and swaps. We offset our exposures based on current and
    projected market conditions, and generally seek to acquire the
    inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible. As discussed
    in Note 2, beginning in fiscal 2008 we do not document our
    commodity derivatives as accounting hedges and accordingly we
    record all volatility in unallocated corporate items until we
    take delivery of the underlying input, when we then transfer the
    gain or loss on the hedge to segment operating profit. Pursuant
    to this policy, unallocated corporate items for fiscal 2008
    included:

As of May 25, 2008, the net notional value of commodity
    derivatives was $784.8 million, of which
    $524.8 million relates to agricultural positions and
    $260.0 million relates to energy positions. These hedges
    relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next
    12 months.

Amounts Recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
    (Loss)

Unrealized losses from interest rate cash
    flow hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) as of May 25, 2008, totaled $39.2 million after
    tax. These deferred losses are primarily related to interest
    rate swaps we entered into in contemplation of future borrowings
    and other financing requirements and are being reclassified into
    net interest over the lives of the hedged forecasted
    transactions. As of May 25, 2008, we had no amounts from
    commodity derivatives recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized losses from foreign
    currency cash flow hedges recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) as of May 25, 2008, were less
    than $1.0 million after-tax. The net amount of pre-tax
    gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) as of May 25, 2008, that is expected to be
    reclassified into net earnings within the next 12 months is
    $16.1 million of expense.

Concentrations of Credit
    Risk

We enter into interest rate, foreign
    exchange, and certain commodity and equity derivatives,
    primarily with a diversified group of highly rated
    counterparties. We continually monitor our positions and the
    credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy,
    limit the amount of credit exposure to any one party. These
    transactions may expose us to potential losses due to the credit
    risk of nonperformance by these counterparties; however, we have
    not incurred a material loss and do not anticipate incurring any
    such material losses. We also enter into commodity futures
    transactions through various regulated exchanges.

During fiscal 2008, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates
    (Wal-Mart), accounted for 19 percent of our consolidated
    net sales and 27 percent of our sales in the
    U.S. Retail segment. No other customer accounted for
    10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. Wal-Mart
    also represented 5 percent of our sales in the
    International segment and 5 percent of our sales in the
    Bakeries and Foodservice segment. As of May 25, 2008,
    Wal-Mart accounted for 23 percent of our U.S. Retail
    receivables, 4 percent of our International receivables,
    and 2 percent of our



Bakeries and Foodservice receivables. The 5 largest customers in
    our U.S. Retail segment accounted for 57 percent of
    its fiscal 2008 net sales, the 5 largest customers in our

To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines
    sufficient to cover our outstanding short-term borrowings. Our
    commercial paper borrowings are supported by $3.0 billion
    of fee-paid committed credit lines and $403.8 million in
    uncommitted lines. As of May 25, 2008, there were no
    amounts outstanding on the fee-paid committed credit lines and
    $133.8 million was drawn on the uncommitted lines, all by
    our international operations. Our committed lines consist of a
    $1.9 billion credit facility expiring in October 2012 and a
    $1.1 billion credit facility expiring in October 2010.

On October 9, 2007, we entered into a new five-year credit
    agreement with an initial aggregate revolving commitment of
    $1.9 billion which is scheduled to expire in October 2012.
    Concurrent with the execution of the new credit agreement, we
    terminated our five-year credit agreement dated January 20,
    2004, which provided $750.0 million of revolving credit and
    was scheduled to expire in January 2009, and our amended and
    restated credit agreement dated October 17, 2006, which
    provided $1.1 billion of revolving credit and was scheduled
    to expire in October 2007. We then terminated our credit
    agreement dated August 3, 2007, which provided an aggregate
    revolving commitment of $750.0 million and was scheduled to
    expire on December 6, 2007.

Long-Term
    Debt

On April 11, 2007, we issued
    $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of floating-rate
    convertible senior notes. On April 11, 2008, the holders of
    those notes put $1.14 billion of the aggregate principal
    amount to us for repurchase. We issued commercial paper to fund
    the repurchase.

On March 17, 2008, we sold $750.0 million of
    5.2 percent fixed-rate notes due March 17, 2015 and on
    August 29, 2007, we sold $700.0 million of
    5.65 percent fixed-rate notes due September 10, 2012.
    The proceeds of the notes were used to repay outstanding
    commercial paper. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually
    in arrears. The notes may be redeemed at our option at any time
    for a specified make-whole amount. The notes are senior
    unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and contain a change of
    control provision, as defined in the instruments governing the
    notes.

On April 25, 2007, we redeemed or converted all of our zero
    coupon convertible debentures due 2022 for a redemption price
    equal to the accreted value of the debentures, which was $734.45
    per $1,000 principal amount of the debentures at maturity. The
    redemption price was settled in cash. For the debentures that
    were converted, we delivered cash equal to the accreted value of
    the debentures, including $23.3 million of accreted
    original issue discount, and issued 284,000 shares of our
    common stock worth $17.0 million to settle the conversion
    value in excess of the accreted value. This premium was recorded
    as a reduction to stockholders’ equity, net of the
    applicable tax benefit. There was no gain or loss associated
    with the redemption or conversions. We used proceeds from the
    issuance of commercial paper to fund the redemption and
    conversions of the debentures.

In January 24, 2007, we issued $1.0 billion of
    5.7 percent fixed-rate notes due February 15, 2017 and
    $500.0 million of floating-rate notes due January 22,
    2010. The proceeds of these notes were used to retire
    $1.5 billion of fixed-rate notes that matured in February
    2007. The floating-rate notes bear interest equal to three-month
    LIBOR plus 0.13 percent, subject to quarterly reset.
    Interest on the floating-rate notes is payable quarterly in
    arrears. The floating-rate notes cannot be called by us prior to
    maturity. Interest on the fixed-rate notes is payable
    semi-annually in arrears. The fixed-rate notes may be called by
    us at any time for cash equal to the greater of the principal
    amounts of the notes and a specified make-whole amount, plus, in
    each case, accrued



and unpaid interest. The notes are senior unsecured,
    unsubordinated obligations. We had previously entered into
    $700.0 million of pay-fixed, forward-starting interest rate
    swaps with an average fixed rate of 5.7 percent in
    anticipation of the fixed-rate note offering.

Our credit facilities and certain of our long-term debt
    agreements contain restrictive covenants. As of May 25,
    2008, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.

As of May 25, 2008, the $61.7 million pre-tax loss
    recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
    associated with our previously designated interest rate swaps
    will be reclassified to net interest over the remaining lives of
    the hedged transactions. The amount expected to be reclassified
    from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net
    interest in fiscal 2009 is $16.1 million pre-tax.

NOTE 9.
    MINORITY INTERESTS

In April 2002, we contributed assets with an aggregate fair
    market value of $4.2 billion to our subsidiary GMC. The
    contributed assets consist primarily of manufacturing assets and
    intellectual property associated with the production and retail
    sale of Big G cereals,

Progresso

soups, and

Old
    El Paso

products in the United States. In exchange for
    the contribution of these assets, GMC issued its managing
    membership interest and its limited preferred membership
    interests to certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We
    continue to hold the managing membership interest, and therefore
    direct the operations of GMC. Other than the right to consent to
    certain actions, holders of the limited preferred membership
    interests do not participate in the management of GMC.

In May 2002, we sold 150,000 Class A Limited Membership
    Interests (Class A Interests) in GMC to an unrelated
    third-party investor for $150.0 million. In June 2007, we
    sold an additional 88,851 Class A Interests to the same
    unrelated third-party investor for $92.3 million. As of
    May 25, 2008, the carrying value of all outstanding
    Class A Interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was
    $242.3 million.

In October 2004, we sold 835,000

Series B-1

Limited Membership Interests

(Series B-1

Interests) in GMC to a different unrelated third-party investor
    for $835.0 million. In August 2007, General Mills Sales,
    Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, purchased for a net amount of
    $843.0 million all of the outstanding

Series B-1

Interests as part of a required remarketing of those interests.
    The purchase price reflected the

Series B-1

Interests’ original capital account balance of
    $835.0 million and $8.0 million of capital account
    appreciation attributable and paid to the third party holder of
    the

Series B-1

Interests. The capital appreciation paid to the third party
    holder of the

Series B-1

Interests was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, a
    component of stockholders’ equity, on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets, and reduced net earnings available to common
    stockholders in our basic and diluted EPS calculations.



We currently hold all interests in GMC other than the
    Class A Interests. The terms of the Class A Interests
    are described in the Fifth Amended and Restated Limited
    Liability Company Agreement of GMC (the LLC Agreement).

The holder of the Class A Interests receives quarterly
    preferred distributions from available net income based on the
    application of a floating preferred return rate, currently equal
    to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 65 basis points, to
    the holder’s capital account balance established in the
    most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently
    $248.1 million). The LLC Agreement requires that the
    preferred return rate of the Class A Interests be adjusted
    every five years through a negotiated agreement between the
    Class A Interest holder and GMC, or through a remarketing
    auction. The next remarketing is scheduled to occur in June 2012
    and thereafter in five year intervals. Upon a failed
    remarketing, the preferred return rate over three-month LIBOR
    will be increased by 75 basis points until the next
    remarketing, which will occur in 3 month intervals until a
    successful remarketing occurs or the managing member purchases
    the Class A Interests. The managing member may at any time
    elect to purchase all of the Class A Interests for an
    amount equal to the holder’s capital account balance (as
    adjusted in a mark-to-market valuation), plus any accrued but
    unpaid preferred returns and the prescribed make-whole amount.

Holders of the Class A Interests may initiate a liquidation
    of GMC under certain circumstances, including, without
    limitation, the bankruptcy of GMC or its subsidiaries,
    GMC’s failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the
    Class A Interests, GMC’s failure to comply with
    portfolio requirements, breaches of certain covenants, lowering
    of our senior debt rating below either Baa3 by Moody’s
    Investors Service or BBB- by Standard & Poor’s,
    and a failed attempt to remarket the Class A Interests as a
    result of GMC’s failure to assist in such remarketing. In
    the event of a liquidation of GMC, each member of GMC will
    receive the amount of its then current capital account balance.
    The managing member may avoid liquidation by exercising its
    option to purchase the Class A Interests.

For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities,
    results of operations, and cash flows of GMC are included in our
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The return to the third party
    investor is reflected in net interest in the Consolidated
    Statements of Earnings. The third party investor’s
    interests in GMC are classified as minority interests on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. As discussed above, we may exercise
    our option to purchase the Class A Interests for
    consideration equal to the then current capital account value,
    plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole
    amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the
    unrelated third party investor’s capital account from its
    original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and
    will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS
    in that period.

Our minority interests contain restrictive covenants. As of
    May 25, 2008, we were in compliance with all of these
    covenants.

General Mills Capital, Inc. was formed in July 2002 for the
    purpose of purchasing and collecting our receivables and
    previously sold $150.0 million of its Series A
    preferred stock to an unrelated third-party investor. In June
    2007, we redeemed all of the Series A preferred stock. We
    used commercial paper borrowings and proceeds from the sale of
    the additional Class A Interests in GMC to fund the
    redemption. There was no gain or loss associated with this
    transaction.

NOTE 10.
    STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Cumulative preference stock of 5.0 million shares, without
    par value, is authorized but unissued.

On December 10, 2007, our Board of Directors approved the
    retirement of 125.0 million shares of common stock in
    treasury effective December 10, 2007. This action reduced
    common stock by $12.5 million, reduced additional paid-in
    capital by $5,068.3 million, and reduced common stock in
    treasury by $5,080.8 million on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

In fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors approved an authorization
    to repurchase up to 75 million shares of our common stock.
    This replaced a prior authorization, which permitted us to
    repurchase shares up to a treasury share balance of
    170 million. Purchases under the new authorization can be
    made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions,
    including the use of call options and other derivative
    instruments,

Rule 10b5-1

trading plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The
    authorization has no pre-established termination date. During
    fiscal 2008, we repurchased 23.9 million shares for an
    aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion, of which
    $0.1 million settled after the end of our fiscal year.
    During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 25.3 million shares for
    an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion, of which
    $64.4 million settled after the end of our fiscal year. In
    fiscal 2006, we repurchased 18.8 million shares of common
    stock for an aggregate purchase price of



$892.4 million. A total of 39.8 million shares were
    held in treasury as of May 25, 2008.

In October 2004, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman Brothers)
    issued $750.0 million of notes, which were mandatorily
    exchangeable for shares of our common stock. In connection with
    the issuance of those notes, an affiliate of Lehman Brothers
    entered into a forward purchase contract with us, under which we
    were obligated to deliver to such affiliate between
    14.0 million and 17.0 million shares of our common
    stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. We
    delivered 14.3 million shares in October 2007, in exchange
    for $750.0 million in cash from Lehman Brothers. We used
    the cash to reduce outstanding commercial paper balances.

The forward purchase contract was considered an equity
    instrument. The $42.6 million fee we paid for the forward
    purchase contract was recorded as a reduction to
    stockholders’ equity in fiscal 2005.

NOTE 11.
    STOCK PLANS

We use broad-based stock plans to help ensure that
    management’s interests are aligned with those of our
    stockholders. As of May 25, 2008, a total of
    10,310,361 shares were available for grant in the form of
    stock options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and
    shares of common stock under the 2007 Stock Compensation Plan
    (2007 Plan) and the 2006 Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
    Directors (2006 Director Plan). On September 24, 2007,
    our stockholders approved the 2007 Plan, replacing the 2005
    Stock Compensation Plan (2005 Plan). Restricted shares and
    restricted stock units may also be granted under our Executive
    Incentive Plan (EIP) through September 25, 2010.
    Stock-based awards now outstanding include some granted under
    the 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998 (senior management), 1998 (employee),
    2001, 2003, and 2005 stock plans, under which no further awards
    may be granted. The stock plans provide for full vesting of
    options, restricted shares, and restricted stock units upon
    completion of specified service periods or in certain
    circumstances, following a change of control. As of May 25,
    2008, a total of 5,150,669 restricted shares and restricted
    stock units were outstanding under all plans.

The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting
    estimate which requires us to use judgments and assumptions that
    are likely to have a material impact on our financial
    statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding
    future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, and
    dividend yield.

We estimate our future stock price volatility using the
    historical volatility over the expected term of the option,
    excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace
    participant would exclude in estimating our stock price
    volatility. For the fiscal 2008 grants, we have excluded
    historical volatility for fiscal 2002 and prior, primarily
    because volatility driven by the acquisition of Pillsbury does
    not reflect what we believe to be expected future volatility. We
    also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our
    estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock,
    especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months, is
    insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected
    volatility.

Our expected term represents the period of time that options
    granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data
    to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the
    valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar
    historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into
    a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average
    expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table
    above. Our valuation model assumes that dividends and our share
    price increase in line with earnings, resulting in a constant
    dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate for periods during
    the expected term of the options is based on the
    U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time
    of grant.



Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or
    vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in
    earnings (referred to as a “windfall tax benefit”) is
    presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a
    financing (rather than an operating) cash flow.

Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional
    paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized
    shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that
    previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the
    cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then
    charged directly to income tax expense, potentially resulting in
    volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. We
    calculated a cumulative memo balance of windfall tax benefits
    from post-1995 fiscal years for the purpose of accounting for
    future shortfall tax benefits.

Options may be priced at 100 percent or more of the fair
    market value on the date of grant, and generally vest four years
    after the date of grant. Options generally expire within
    10 years and one month after the date of grant. Under the
    2006 Director Plan, through fiscal 2008 each nonemployee
    director received upon election and re-election to the Board of
    Directors options to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock
    that generally vest one year, and expire within 10 years,
    after the date of grant. The stock options granted to directors
    will generally vest one year, and expire within 10 years,
    after the grant date. Beginning in fiscal 2009, each director
    will receive stock options valued at $90,000 upon their
    appointment and each re-election.

    As a result, we did not make an annual stock option grant during
    fiscal 2006.

Stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards
    was $52.8 million in fiscal 2008 and $54.0 million in
    fiscal 2007.

Restricted Stock and
    Restricted Stock Units

Stock and units
    settled in stock subject to a restricted period and a purchase
    price, if any (as determined by the Compensation Committee of
    the Board of Directors), may be granted to key employees under
    the 2007 Plan. Restricted shares and restricted stock units, up
    to 50 percent of the value of an individual’s cash
    incentive award,



may also be granted through the EIP. Certain restricted stock
    and restricted stock unit awards require the employee to deposit
    personally owned shares (on a one-for-one basis) with us during
    the restricted period. Restricted stock and restricted stock
    units generally vest and become unrestricted four years after
    the date of grant. Participants are entitled to cash dividends
    on such awarded shares and units, but the sale or transfer of
    these shares and units is restricted during the vesting period.
    Participants holding restricted stock, but not restricted stock
    units, are entitled to vote on matters submitted to holders of
    common stock for a vote. Under the 2006 Director Plan,
    through fiscal 2008 each nonemployee director received 1,000
    restricted stock units each time he or she was elected to the
    Board. These units generally vest one year after the date of
    grant. Beginning in fiscal 2009, each director will receive
    $90,000 in restricted stock units upon their appointment and
    each re-election based on the closing stock price of our common
    stock on the date of the grant.

NOTE 13.
    RETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

Defined Benefit Pension
    Plans

We have defined benefit pension plans
    covering most domestic, Canadian, and United Kingdom employees.
    Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service
    and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees
    include various monthly amounts for each year of credited
    service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements
    of applicable laws. We made $14.2 million of voluntary
    contributions to these plans in fiscal 2008. Our principal
    domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a
    provision that any excess pension assets would vest in plan
    participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a
    change in control.

Other Postretirement Benefit
    Plans

We sponsor plans that provide
    health-care benefits to the majority of our domestic and
    Canadian retirees. The salaried health care benefit plan is
    contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of
    service. We fund related trusts for certain employees and
    retirees on an annual basis. We did not make voluntary
    contributions to these plans in fiscal 2008. Assumed health care
    cost trend rates are as follows:

Fiscal Year



Health care cost trend rate for next year

9.25% and 10.25%

10.0% and 11.0%

Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline
    (ultimate rate)

5.2%

5.2%

Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate


2014/2015

We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review
    is based on data we collect about our health care claims
    experience and information provided by our actuaries. This
    information includes recent plan experience, plan design,
    overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions
    used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care
    cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent
    with this review, recent experiences, and short term
    expectations. Our current health care cost trend rate assumption
    is 10.25 percent for retirees age 65 and over and
    9.25 percent for retirees under age 65. These rates
    are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of
    5.2 percent is reached in 2016 for all retirees. The trend
    rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’
    benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The
    ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to
    approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term
    inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed
    trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on
    the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.

A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate
    would have the following effects:

We use our fiscal year end as the measurement date for all our

Postemployment Benefit
    Plans

Under certain circumstances we also
    provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in
    the United States, Canada, and Mexico and members of our Board
    of Directors, including severance and certain other benefits
    payable upon death. We recognize an obligation for any of these
    benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment
    benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as
    severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of
    service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our
    postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.

Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the
    last day of our fiscal year for all of the defined benefit
    pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit
    obligations. Those same discount rates also are used to
    determine defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and
    postemployment benefit income and expense for the following
    fiscal year. We work with our actuaries to determine the timing
    and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants
    and, using top quartile AA-rated corporate bond yields, to
    develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to
    that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate
    curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to
    determine our discount rate assumptions.

Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our
    asset allocation, our historical long-term investment
    performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset
    class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and
    investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We
    review this assumption annually for each plan, however, our
    annual investment performance for one particular year does not,
    by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.

The investment objective for our domestic defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the
    benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us.
    Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a
    moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefit plan portfolios are broadly diversified
    across asset classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are
    further diversified across investment styles and investment
    organizations. For the defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy
    allocations are: 30 percent to United States equities;
    20 percent to international equities; 10 percent to
    private equities; 30 percent to fixed income; and
    10 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and
    timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary
    tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on
    relative market valuations.

Contributions and Future
    Benefit Payments

We expect to make
    contributions of $28.1 million to our defined benefit,
    other postretirement, and postemployment benefits plans in
    fiscal 2009. Actual 2009 contributions could exceed our current
    projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake
    discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other
    competing investment priorities and future changes in government
    requirements. Estimated benefit payments, which reflect expected
    future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid from
    fiscal

Defined Contribution
    Plans

The General Mills Savings Plan is a
    defined contribution plan that covers salaried and nonunion
    employees. It had net assets of $2,309.9 million as of
    May 25, 2008 and $2,303.0 million as of May 27,
    2007. This plan is a 401(k) savings plan that includes a number
    of investment funds and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).
    We sponsor another savings plan for certain hourly employees
    with net assets of $16.0 million as of May 25, 2008.
    Our total recognized expense related to defined contribution
    plans was $61.9 million in fiscal 2008, $48.3 million
    in fiscal 2007, and $45.5 million in fiscal 2006.

The ESOP originally purchased our common stock principally with
    funds borrowed from third parties and guaranteed by us. The ESOP
    shares are included in net shares outstanding for the purposes
    of calculating EPS. The ESOP’s third-party debt was repaid
    on June 30, 2007. The ESOP’s only assets are our
    common stock and temporary cash balances. The ESOP’s share
    of the total defined contribution expense was $52.3 million
    in fiscal 2008, $40.1 million in fiscal 2007, and
    $37.6 million in fiscal 2006. The ESOP’s expense was
    calculated by the “shares allocated” method.

The ESOP used our common stock to convey benefits to employees
    and, through increased stock ownership, to further align
    employee interests with those of stockholders. We matched a
    percentage of employee contributions to the General Mills
    Savings Plan with a base match plus a variable year end match
    that depended on annual results. Employees received our match in
    the form of common stock.

Our cash contribution to the ESOP was calculated so as to pay
    off enough debt to release sufficient shares to make our match.
    The ESOP used our cash contributions to the plan, plus the
    dividends received on the ESOP’s leveraged shares, to make



principal and interest payments on the ESOP’s debt. As loan
    payments were made, shares became unencumbered by debt and were
    committed to be allocated. The ESOP allocated shares to
    individual employee accounts on the basis of the match of
    employee payroll savings (contributions), plus reinvested
    dividends received on previously allocated shares. The ESOP
    incurred net interest of less than $1.0 million in each of
    fiscal 2007 and 2006. The ESOP used dividends of
    $2.5 million in fiscal 2007 and $3.9 million in 2006,
    along with our contributions of less than $1.0 million in
    each of fiscal 2007 and 2006 to make interest and principal
    payments.

The number of shares of our common stock allocated to
    participants in the ESOP was 5.2 million as of May 25,
    2008 and 5.4 million as of May 27, 2007.

Of the total valuation allowance of $521.5 million,
    $205.4 million relates to a deferred tax asset for losses
    recorded as part of the Pillsbury acquisition. In the future,
    when tax benefits related to these losses are finalized, the
    reduction in the valuation allowance, if any, will be allocated
    to reduce goodwill. The change in the valuation allowance was
    entirely offset by an equal adjustment to the underlying
    deferred tax asset; however, certain capital losses were
    recognizable with a similar offset to the valuation allowance as
    a result of this change. Of the remaining valuation allowance,
    $219.5 million relates to capital loss carryforwards and



$93.2 million relates to state and foreign operating loss
    carryforwards. In the future, if tax benefits are realized
    related to the operating losses, the reduction in the valuation
    allowance will generally reduce tax expense. If tax benefits are
    realized related to capital losses, the amounts will reduce
    goodwill. As of May 25, 2008, we believe it is more likely
    than not that the remainder of our deferred tax asset is
    realizable.

The carryforward periods on our foreign loss carryforwards are
    as follows: $39.5 million do not expire; $5.0 million
    expire between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010; $26.7 million
    expire between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2016; and
    $18.1 million expire in fiscal 2018.

We have not recognized a deferred tax liability for unremitted
    earnings of $2.2 billion from our foreign operations
    because we do not expect those earnings to become taxable to us
    in the foreseeable future.

We adopted the provisions of FIN 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109,” (FIN 48) as of the
    beginning of fiscal 2008. Prior to adoption, our policy was to
    establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known
    tax contingencies. The effects of final resolution, if any, were
    recognized as changes to the effective income tax rate in the
    period of resolution. FIN 48 requires application of a more
    likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition
    of uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 requires us to recognize
    the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than
    50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon
    settlement. It further requires that a change in judgment
    related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax
    positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such
    change.

As a result of adoption, we recorded a $218.1 million
    reduction to accrued tax liabilities, a $151.9 million
    reduction to goodwill, a $57.8 million increase to
    additional paid in capital, and an $8.4 million increase to
    retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal 2008.

The following table sets forth changes in our total gross
    unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, excluding accrued
    interest, for fiscal 2008. Approximately $157.0 million of
    this total represents the amount that, if recognized, would
    affect our effective income tax rate in future periods. This
    amount differs from the gross unrecognized tax benefits
    presented in the table because the majority of the liabilities
    below are the result of acquisition-related tax contingencies.
    We also would record a decrease in U.S. federal income
    taxes upon recognition of the state tax benefits included
    therein.

As of May 25, 2008, we have classified approximately
    $0.4 million of the unrecognized tax benefits as a current
    liability as these amounts are expected to be paid within the
    next 12 months. The remaining amount of our unrecognized
    tax liability was classified in other liabilities.

We report accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized
    tax benefits in income tax expense. For fiscal 2008, we
    recognized a net $15.6 million of tax-related net interest
    and penalties, and had $107.3 million of accrued interest
    and penalties as of May 25, 2008.

Annually we file more than 350 income tax returns in
    approximately 100 global taxing jurisdictions. Management
    judgment is involved in determining our effective tax rate and
    in evaluating the ultimate resolution of any uncertain tax
    positions. We are periodically under examination or engaged in a
    tax controversy. We establish reserves in a variety of taxing
    jurisdictions when, despite our belief that our tax return
    positions are supportable, we believe that certain positions may
    be challenged and may need to be revised. We adjust these
    reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as
    the progress of a tax audit. Our effective income tax rate
    includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to those
    reserves. We also provide interest on these reserves at the
    appropriate statutory interest rate. These interest charges are
    also included in our effective tax rate.

We do not expect that the amount of our tax reserves will
    materially change in the next 12 months other than the
    payment of the amount noted above which is identified as a
    current liability.



The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the
    tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions include the
    United States (federal and state) and Canada. We are no longer
    subject to U.S. federal examinations by the Internal
    Revenue Service (IRS) for fiscal years before 2002. During
    fiscal 2008, we received a favorable District Court decision on
    an uncertain tax matter related to the fiscal years prior to
    2002 and reduced our liability for uncertain tax positions by
    $21.0 million and related accrued interest by
    $9.7 million. The IRS has appealed the District Court
    decision, and accordingly, its ultimate resolution is subject to
    change. During fiscal 2008, we also concluded various matters
    for fiscal years

1998-2001

which included a payment of $31.7 million. The IRS recently
    concluded field examinations for our 2002 and 2003 fiscal years.
    A payment of $24.8 million was made during the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008 to cover the additional tax liability
    plus interest related to all agreed adjustments for this audit
    cycle. The IRS also proposed additional adjustments for the

2002-2003

audit cycle including several adjustments to the tax benefits
    associated with the sale of minority interests in our GMC
    subsidiary. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend
    to vigorously defend our position. Our potential liability for
    this matter is significant and, notwithstanding our reserves
    against this potential liability, an unfavorable resolution
    could have a material adverse impact on our results of
    operations and cash flows from operations. The IRS initiated its
    audit of our fiscal 2004 through 2006 tax years during the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008.

Various examinations by United States state taxing authorities
    could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by
    jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5 years.
    Currently, several state examinations are in progress. The
    Canada Revenue Agency is conducting an audit of our income tax
    returns in Canada for fiscal years 2003 (which is the earliest
    tax year still open for examination) through 2005. We do not
    anticipate that any United States state tax or Canadian tax
    adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial
    position, cash flows, or results of operations.

    primarily CPW.

We are involved in various claims, including environmental
    matters, arising in the ordinary course of business. In the
    opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these
    matters, either individually or in aggregate, will not have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position or results of

NOTE
    16. BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We operate in the consumer foods industry. We have three
    operating segments by type of customer and geographic region as
    follows: U.S. Retail, 66.5 percent of our fiscal 2008
    consolidated net sales; International, 18.7 percent of our
    fiscal 2008 consolidated net sales; and Bakeries and
    Foodservice, 14.8 percent of our fiscal 2008 consolidated
    net sales.

Our U.S. Retail segment reflects business with a wide
    variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership
    stores, natural food chains and drug, dollar and discount chains
    operating throughout the United States. Our major product
    categories in the United States are ready-to-eat cereals,
    refrigerated yogurt, ready-to-serve soup, dry dinners, shelf
    stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and frozen dough
    products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza
    snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, microwave popcorn, and a
    wide variety of organic products including soup, granola bars,
    and cereal.

Our International segment is made up of retail businesses
    outside of the United States. In Canada, our major product
    categories are ready-to-eat cereals, shelf stable and frozen
    vegetables, dry dinners, refrigerated and frozen dough products,
    dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks, and grain, fruit
    and savory snacks. In markets outside the United States and
    Canada, our product categories include super-premium ice cream,
    granola and grain snacks, shelf stable and frozen vegetables,
    dough products, and dry dinners. Our International segment also
    includes products manufactured in the United States for export,
    primarily to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as
    products we manufacture for sale to our joint ventures. Revenues
    from export activities are reported in the region or country
    where the end customer is located.

In our Bakeries and Foodservice segment, we sell branded
    cereals, snacks, dinner and side dish products, refrigerated and
    soft-serve frozen yogurt, frozen dough products, branded baking
    mixes, and custom food items. Our customers include foodservice
    distributors and operators, convenience stores, vending machine
    operators, quick service chains and other restaurants, and
    business, school and healthcare cafeterias in the United States
    and Canada. In addition, mixes and unbaked and fully baked
    frozen dough products are marketed throughout the United States
    and Canada to retail, supermarket, and wholesale bakeries.

Operating profit for these segments excludes unallocated
    corporate items, including variances to planned corporate
    overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee
    benefits and incentives, all stock compensation costs, annual
    contributions to the General Mills Foundation, and other items
    that are not part of our measurement of segment operating
    performance. These include restructuring, impairment, and other
    exit costs, as well as gains and losses arising from the
    revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and losses
    from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions
    until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with
    our internal hedge documentation as discussed in Note 7.
    These items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at
    the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment
    profitability reviewed by executive management. Under our supply
    chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse, and
    distribution activities are substantially integrated across our
    operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As
    a result, fixed assets and depreciation and amortization
    expenses are neither maintained nor available by operating
    segment.

Controls
    and Procedures

We, under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the
    design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
    (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the 1934 Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
    that, as of May 25, 2008, our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the
    1934 Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and
    reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules
    and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the 1934 Act) during our fiscal quarter ended
    May 25, 2008 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of General Mills, Inc. is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting, as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the 1934 Act. The Company’s internal control
    system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our
    management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation
    and fair presentation of published financial statements. Under
    the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of May 25,
    2008. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
    set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment using the criteria set forth by COSO in
    Internal Control – Integrated Framework, management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of May 25, 2008.

KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has
    issued a report on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.
