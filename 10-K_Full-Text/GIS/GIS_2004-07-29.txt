PART I

ITEM 1 —

Business.

COMPANY OVERVIEW

General Mills, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1928. The terms “General Mills,”
“Company” and “Registrant” mean General Mills, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context
indicates otherwise.

General Mills is a leading producer of packaged consumer foods and operates exclusively in the
consumer foods industry. The Company’s businesses are divided into three reportable segments:

•

U.S. Retail;

•

Bakeries and Foodservice; and

•

International.

The Company’s operating segments are organized generally by product categories. U.S.
Retail consists of cereals, meals, refrigerated and frozen dough products, baking products, snacks, yogurt and organic
foods. The Bakeries and Foodservice segment consists of products marketed to retail and wholesale bakeries and offered
to the commercial and noncommercial foodservice sectors throughout the United States and Canada, such as restaurants and
business and school cafeterias. The International segment is made up of retail business outside the United States and
foodservice business outside of the United States and Canada. A more detailed description of the product categories for
each reportable segment is set forth below.

On October 31, 2001, General Mills completed the acquisition of the worldwide businesses
of The Pillsbury Company from Diageo plc (“Diageo”). With the Pillsbury acquisition, the Company added
established, market-leading brands to its U.S. retail business, more than doubled its foodservice business,
significantly increased its international presence and created opportunities for productivity improvement and cost
synergies. For a more detailed description of the Pillsbury acquisition, please see Note Two to the Consolidated
Financial Statements appearing on page 28 in Item Eight of this report.

JOINT VENTURES

In addition to its consolidated operations, the Company manufactures and sells products
through several joint ventures.

DOMESTIC JOINT VENTURE.

The Company has a 50 percent equity
interest in 8th Continent, LLC, a joint venture formed with DuPont to develop and market soy-based products. This
venture began marketing a line of

8th Continent

soymilk to limited markets in July 2001 and nationally in June
2003.

INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES.

The Company has a 50 percent equity

than 130 countries and republics. The cereal products marketed by CPW under the umbrella

Nestlé

trademark
in fiscal 2004 included:

production of

Green Giant

canned corn in France.

See Note Four to the Consolidated Financial
Statements appearing on page 31 in Item Eight of this report.

COMPETITION

The consumer foods market is highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes
in the United States and throughout the world. The Company’s principal strategies for competing in each of its
segments include superior product quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovations and price. In
most product categories, the Company competes not only with other widely advertised branded products of major companies,
but also with generic products and private label products, which are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally,
the Company primarily competes with local manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors.

CUSTOMERS

During fiscal 2004, one customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 14
percent of the Company’s consolidated net sales and 19 percent of the Company’s sales in the U.S. Retail
segment. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the Company’s consolidated net sales. The top five
customers of our U.S. Retail segment accounted for approximately 43 percent of the segment’s fiscal 2004 net
sales. For the Bakeries and Foodservice segment, the top five customers accounted for approximately 34 percent of the
segment’s fiscal 2004 net sales.

SEASONALITY

In general, demand for the Company’s products is evenly balanced throughout the year.
However, demand for the Company’s refrigerated dough, frozen baked goods and baking products is stronger in the
fourth calendar quarter. Demand for

Progresso

soup is higher during the fall and winter months. Internationally,
demand for

Häagen-Dazs

ice cream is higher during the summer months and demand for the baking mix and dough
products increases during winter months. Due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends, as well as the different
seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres, the Company’s international net sales are generally evenly
balanced throughout the year.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Trademarks and Patents.

Trademarks and service marks are vital to the Company’s
businesses. The Company’s products are marketed under trademarks and service marks that are owned by or licensed to
the Company. The most significant trademarks and service marks used in the Company’s businesses are set forth in

italics

in the business discussions above. These marks include the trademarks used in our international joint
ventures that are owned by or licensed to the joint ventures. In addition, some of the Company’s products are
marketed under or in combination with trademarks that have been licensed from others, including

Yoplait

yogurt,

Reese’s Puffs

cereal,

Hershey’s

chocolate included with a variety of products, and a variety of
characters and brands used on fruit snacks, including

Sunkist, Shrek

, and various Warner Bros. and Sesame
Workshop characters.

As part of the fiscal 2002 sale to International Multifoods Corporation (IMC) of certain
Pillsbury dessert and specialty product businesses, IMC received an exclusive royalty-free license to use the

Doughboy

trademark and

Pillsbury

brand in the desserts and baking mix categories. The licenses are
renewable without cost in 20-year increments at IMC’s discretion. In June 2004, J. M. Smucker Company acquired IMC
and now has the right to use the marks under the terms of the licenses.

The Company considers the collective rights under its various patents, which expire from time
to time, a valuable asset, but the Company does not believe that its businesses are materially dependent upon any single
patent or group of related patents.

Raw Materials and Supplies.

The principal raw materials used by General Mills are
cereal grains, sugar, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, meats, other agricultural products, vegetable oils, plastic
and paper packaging materials, operating supplies and energy. The Company has some long-term fixed price contracts, but
the majority of such raw materials are purchased on the open market. The Company believes that it will be able to obtain
an adequate supply of needed ingredients and packaging materials. Occasionally and where possible, the Company makes
advance purchases of items significant to its business in order to ensure continuity of operations. The Company’s
objective is to procure materials meeting both the company’s quality standards and its production needs at the
lowest total cost to the Company.


The Company’s strategy is to buy these materials at price levels that allow a targeted
profit margin. Since commodities generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing the Company’s
products, to the extent possible, the Company hedges the risk associated with adverse price movements using
exchange-traded futures and options, forward cash contracts and over-the-counter hedging mechanisms. These tools enable
the Company to manage the related commodity price risk over periods of time that exceed the period of time in which the
physical commodity is available. Accordingly, the Company uses these hedging tools to mitigate the risks associated with
adverse price movements and not to speculate in the marketplace. See also Note Seven to the Consolidated Financial
Statements appearing on pages 34 through 35 in Item Eight of this report and the “Market Risk Management”
section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation appearing on
page 19 in Item Seven of this report.

Capital Expenditures.

During the fiscal year ended May 30, 2004, General
Mills’ aggregate capital expenditures for fixed assets and intangibles amounted to $653 million, including
construction costs to consolidate the Company’s headquarters and expenditures associated with the acquisition and
integration of Pillsbury. The Company expects to spend approximately $450-500 million for capital projects in
fiscal 2005, primarily for fixed assets to support further growth and increase supply chain productivity.

Research and Development.

Major research and development facilities are located at
the Riverside Technical Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota and the James Ford Bell Technical Center in Golden Valley
(suburban Minneapolis), Minnesota. General Mills’ research and development resources are focused on new product
development, product improvement, process design and improvement, packaging, and exploratory research in new business
areas. Research and development expenditures amounted to $158 million in fiscal 2004, $149 million in fiscal
2003 and $131 million in fiscal 2002.

Employees.

At May 30, 2004, General Mills had approximately 27,580 employees.

Food Quality and Safety Regulation.

The manufacture and sale of consumer food products
is highly regulated. In the United States, the Company’s activities are subject to regulation by various government
agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, United States Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission
and Department of Commerce, as well as various state and local agencies. The Company’s business is also regulated
by similar agencies outside of the United States.

Environmental Matters.

As of June 2004, General Mills was involved with the following
active cleanup sites associated with the alleged release or threatened release of hazardous substances or wastes:

Newark, NJ

No single hazardous

These matters involve several different actions, including litigation initiated by
governmental authorities and/or private parties, administrative proceedings commenced by regulatory agencies, and demand
letters issued by regulatory agencies and/or private parties. Of the 16 matters in the table above, the Company is a
party to current litigation related to two cleanup sites:

•

Pennsauken Solid Waste Management Authority, et al. v. State of New Jersey, et al.,
Defendants — Quick-way, Inc., Defendant and Third-party Plaintiff, v. A-1 Accoustical Ceiling, Inc. et al.

involves a State of New Jersey superfund site where a former subsidiary of the Company has been sued as a third-party
defendant. The Company is defending this


action under the terms of an indemnification agreement. The amount of the cleanup liability
has not been determined.

•

West Coast Home Builders, Inc. v. Ashland Inc., et al.

involves a claim for an
unspecified amount of damages for the diminished value of property adjacent to a State of California superfund site. The
cleanup of the site is covered by an existing settlement agreement between the State of California and a group of the
potentially responsible parties, including the Company. A tolling agreement has expired and, as a result, the complaint
has been re-filed by the plaintiff, but not yet served on the Company. In addition, the potentially responsible parties
have an insurance policy that covers the costs of cleanup in excess of amounts already paid, including third party
claims related to the site. We believe the claims are covered by the insurance policy and that the Company does not have
any financial exposure as a result of this litigation.

•

SPPI-Sommerville Inc., et al v. TRC Companies, Inc. et al.

involves a claim for an unspecified amount of
damages for the diminished value of another parcel of property adjacent to the same State of California superfund site
as the West Coast Home Builders claim. This claim has been filed with the court but has not yet been served on the
Company. As with the West Coast Home Builders claim, the potentially responsible parties have an insurance policy that
covers the costs of cleanup in excess of amounts already paid, including third party claims related to the site. The
Company believes the claims are covered by the insurance policy and that the Company does not have any financial
exposure as a result of this litigation.

The Company recognizes that its potential exposure with respect to any of these sites may be
joint and several, but has concluded that its probable aggregate exposure is not material. This conclusion is based
upon, among other things, the Company’s payments and/or accruals with respect to each site; the number, ranking,
and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties identified at each of the sites; the status of the
proceedings, including various settlement agreements, consent decrees or court orders; allocations of volumetric waste
contributions and allocations of relative responsibility among potentially responsible parties developed by regulatory
agencies and by private parties; remediation cost estimates prepared by governmental authorities or private technical
consultants; and the Company’s historical experience in negotiating and settling disputes with respect to similar
sites.

The Company’s operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, and the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, and all similar state environmental laws applicable to the jurisdictions in
which we operate.

Based on current facts and circumstances, the Company believes that neither the results of its
environmental proceedings nor its compliance in general with environmental laws or regulations will have a material
adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.

ITEM 2 —

Properties.

General Mills’ principal executive offices and main research facilities are
Company-owned, and are located in the Minneapolis, Minnesota metropolitan area. The Company owns and operates numerous
manufacturing facilities, and maintains many sales and administrative offices and warehouses, mainly in the United
States. Other facilities are operated in Canada and elsewhere around the world.

As of May 2004, General Mills operated 63 facilities for the production of a wide variety of
food products. Of these plants, 36 are located in the United States, nine in Asia/Pacific, seven in Canada and Mexico,
six in Europe, four in Latin America and one in South Africa.

The Company owns flour mills at eight locations: Avon, Iowa; Buffalo, New York; Great Falls,
Montana; Kansas City, Missouri; Minneapolis, Minnesota (2); Vallejo, California; and Vernon, California. The Company
operates seven terminal grain elevators and has country grain elevators in eight locations, plus additional seasonal
elevators, primarily in Idaho.

The Company also owns or leases warehouse space aggregating approximately 10,500,000 square
feet, of which approximately 8,600,000 square feet are leased. A number of sales and administrative offices
are maintained by the Company in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere around the world, totaling approximately
3,000,000 square feet.


ITEM 3 —

Legal Proceedings.

In management’s opinion, there were no claims or litigation pending as
of May 30, 2004, that could have a material adverse effect on
the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the
Company. See the information contained under the section entitled
“Environmental Matters,” on pages 4 and 5 of this report, for a
discussion of environmental matters in which the Company is involved.

On October 15, 2003, the Company announced that the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had issued a formal request
for information concerning the Company’s sales practices and related
accounting. On February 3, 2004, the Company announced that
the Staff of the SEC had issued a Wells notice reflecting the Staff’s
intention to recommend that the SEC bring a civil action against the
Company, its Chief Executive Officer, and its Chief Financial Officer.

The Staff indicated to the Company that its intended
recommendation focused on at least two disclosure issues related to the
U.S. Retail division. First, the Staff believed that the Company does
not adequately disclose the practice of “loading” at the end of
fiscal quarters to help meet internal sales targets or the impact of
such quarter-end “loading” on current and future period results of
operations. The Company understands the term “loading” in this
context to mean the use of discounts or other promotional programs to
encourage retailers and wholesalers to increase their purchases of
Company products. Second, the Staff believed that the Company had
misstated its policy on product returns. The Staff also informed the
Company that its investigation is ongoing.

The Company, its Chief Executive Officer, and its Chief Financial
Officer responded to the Wells notice with a written submission
explaining the factual and legal bases for the Company’s belief that
its sales practices comply with all applicable regulations. The SEC
subsequently issued a formal request for additional information in
connection with its investigation. At this time, it is not possible to
predict how long the investigation will continue or whether the SEC
will bring any legal action against the Company.

ITEM 7 —

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

General Mills is a global consumer foods company. We develop
differentiated food products and market these value-added
products under unique brand names. We work continuously on
product innovation to improve our established brands and to create new
products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. In
addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with
strong consumer-directed marketing and innovative merchandising. We
believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and
sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe.

Our businesses are organized into three segments. Our U.S. Retail
segment accounted for approximately 70 percent of our fiscal 2004 net
sales, and reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores,
specialty stores, drug and discount chains, and mass merchandisers
operating throughout the United States. Our major product categories in
this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals, meals, refrigerated and
frozen dough products, baking products, snacks, yogurt and organic
foods. Our Bakeries and Foodservice segment generated approximately 16
percent of fiscal 2004 net sales. This business segment consists of
products marketed to retail and wholesale bakeries, and to commercial
and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators throughout the
United States and Canada. The remaining 14 percent of our fiscal 2004
net sales was generated by our consolidated International businesses.
These include a retail business in Canada that largely mirrors our U.S. retail product mix, along with
retail and foodservice businesses competing in key markets in
Europe, Latin America and the Asia/Pacific region.

In addition to these consolidated operations, we participate in several
joint ventures. We record our proportionate share of after-tax earnings
or losses from these ventures. In fiscal 2004, joint ventures accounted
for $74 million of our after-tax earnings.

Our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our
shareholders over the long term by delivering consistent growth in sales and earnings, coupled with an attractive
dividend yield. We have met this objective over the most recent five-year period (fiscal 1999 to 2004), as General
Mills’ total return to shareholders has averaged 5 percent while the S&P 500 Index has posted a negative
2 percent average annual return over this period. However, in the most recent fiscal year the 22 percent return of
the S&P 500 Index outperformed our 1 percent return.

We achieved good sales and earnings gains in fiscal 2004, which
included the benefit of an extra week. For the 53-week period ended May 30, 2004, our net sales grew 5 percent
and diluted earnings per share grew 13 percent. Details of our financial results are provided in the Results of
Operations section below. Our cash flow in 2004 was strong, enabling us to pay out almost 40 percent of earnings as
dividends, make significant fixed asset investments to support future growth and productivity, and reduce the balance of
our adjusted debt plus minority interests by $572 million (see definition of adjusted debt on page 14 of this
report). We have prioritized debt repayment as a use of cash for the three-year period through fiscal 2006. Our goal is
to reduce the balance of our adjusted debt plus minority interests by a cumulative $2 billion by the end of
2006, and thereby improve our fixed charge coverage to the levels we demonstrated prior to our acquisition of
Pillsbury in October 2001.

While our earnings results in 2004 were good overall, they fell short of our initial
expectations for the year due to three principal factors. First, higher commodity costs reduced our gross margin.
Second, the recent popularity of low-carbohydrate diets slowed sales in several of our major product categories. And
finally, our Bakeries and Foodservice business fell well short of targeted results, due in part to the low-carbohydrate
trend and higher supply chain costs. These results also reflect disruption caused by our own manufacturing realignment
actions and decisions to eliminate low-margin product lines in a number of customer categories.

In fiscal 2005, we face several challenges that will hinder earnings growth. The first obvious
hurdle is the fact that we


will have one less week of business in 2005 going up against 53-week results in 2004. But
beyond that, commodity prices continue to rise — our 2005 business plan assumes a significant increase in commodity
costs compared to our 2004 expense. Energy costs and our salary and benefit expense are expected to be higher. And from
an operations perspective, we need to stabilize trends in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment.

To partially offset the higher input costs we are experiencing, we have increased list prices
on certain product lines. We also plan to increase merchandised price points for certain products. However, these
actions won’t entirely cover our increased costs. We plan to capture additional supply chain productivity during
2005, and we will continue to control administrative costs companywide. We also have identified opportunities to
reconfigure certain manufacturing activities to improve our cost structure.

We believe the key driver of our results in 2005 will be the success of our product
innovation, which is critical to achieving unit volume growth. Our business plans include new product activity and
innovations that respond to consumers’ interest in health and nutrition, convenience and new flavor varieties.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — 2004 vs. 2003

Net sales for the company increased 5 percent for the year compared
to sales in fiscal 2003. Excluding the effect of the 53rd week, net
sales increased 4 percent. The components of net sales growth are shown
in the following table:

The unit volume growth in fiscal 2004 contributed approximately
$130 million in gross margin improvement (net sales less cost of sales)
over fiscal 2003. However, gross margin increased by only $89 million.
Increased cost of sales, driven primarily by more than $100 million in
commodity cost increases, could not be fully covered by net pricing
realization. As a result, gross margin as a percent of net sales
decreased from 42 percent in fiscal 2003 to 41 percent in fiscal 2004.

Selling, general and administrative costs decreased by $29 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004, driven by a

$36 million decrease in merger-related costs. These
merger-related costs are infrequently occurring items related to the
planning and execution of the integration of Pillsbury, including
consulting, system conversions, relocation, training and
communications.

Net interest expense decreased 7 percent from $547 million in fiscal
2003 to $508 million in fiscal 2004, primarily due to favorable
interest rates. We have in place a net amount of interest rate swaps
that convert $79 million of floating rate debt to fixed rates. Our
portfolio of interest rate swaps has an average life of 4.0 years and has an average fixed rate of 5.3 percent. Taking into
account the effect of all of our interest rate swaps, the average
interest rate on our total outstanding debt as of May 30,
2004 was approximately 5.8 percent.

Restructuring and other exit costs were $26 million in fiscal 2004, as
described in more detail in Note Three to the consolidated financial
statements. Approximately $11 million was related to plant
closures in the Netherlands, Brazil and California. We recorded an
additional $7 million primarily related to adjustments of costs
associated with previously announced closures of manufacturing
facilities. In addition, we recorded $8 million for severance,
primarily related to realignment actions in our Bakeries and
Foodservice organization. Our fiscal 2003 results included
restructuring and other exit costs of $62 million. These costs also are
discussed in Note Three.

Our effective income tax rate was 35 percent in fiscal 2004 and 2003.

After-tax earnings from joint venture operations grew 21 percent to reach $74 million in fiscal 2004, compared with $61
million reported a year earlier. Profits for Cereal Partners Worldwide
(CPW), our joint venture with Nestlé, and Snack Ventures Europe
(SVE), our joint venture with PepsiCo, together grew to $58 million, 29
percent higher than last year’s profits. Häagen-Dazs joint ventures
profits were partially offset by continued marketing investment for 8th
Continent, the Company’s soy products joint venture with DuPont. These
two ventures combined for $16 million of profit. General
Mills’ proportionate share of joint venture net sales grew to $1.2
billion, compared to $1.0 billion in fiscal 2003.

Average diluted shares outstanding were 384 million in fiscal 2004, up 2 percent from 378 million in fiscal 2003 primarily due to
stock option exercises.

Net income increased to $1,055 million in fiscal 2004, from $917
million in 2003. Net income per diluted share of $2.75 in 2004 was up
13 percent from $2.43 in 2003 as a result of the increased income from
operations. We exceeded our debt reduction goal for the year, retiring
$572 million of


adjusted debt plus minority interests, a key internal measure that we
define in our Capital Structure table on page 14.

Operating Segment Results

U.S. Retail Segment

Net sales for our U.S. Retail operations totaled $7.76 billion in
fiscal 2004, compared to $7.41 billion in fiscal 2003. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following

The unit volume growth in fiscal 2004 contributed approximately
$125 million in gross margin improvement over fiscal 2003, but gross
margin increased by only $54 million. Increased cost of sales, driven
primarily by more than $90 million in commodity cost
increases, could not be fully covered by net pricing realization. As a
result, gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased from 48
percent in fiscal 2003 to 46 percent in fiscal 2004.

Selling, general and administrative costs decreased by $1 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004.

Operating profits grew to $1.81 billion, up from $1.75 billion in fiscal 2003.


Bakeries and Foodservice Segment

Net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice operations fell to $1.76 billion in fiscal
2004 compared to $1.80 billion in fiscal 2003. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following
table:

The unit volume decline in fiscal 2004 reduced gross margin by
approximately $11 million compared to 2003. However, gross margin
declined by $46 million. Increased cost of sales, driven primarily by
$35 million in increased manufacturing expense, could not be fully
covered by net pricing realization. As a result, gross margin as a
percent of net sales decreased from 25 percent in fiscal 2003 to 23
percent in fiscal 2004.

Selling, general and administrative costs decreased by $22 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004, driven primarily by an $8
million reduction in consumer marketing expense and an $8 million
reduction in general administrative expense.

Operating profits fell from $156 million in fiscal 2003 to $132 million
in fiscal 2004.

International Segment

Net sales for our International operations totaled $1.55 billion in fiscal 2004 compared to $1.30 billion in 2003. The
components of net sales growth are shown in the following table:

Unit volume grew 5 percent for the year and comparable 52-week
volume was up 4 percent. Canada and export operations each had 53-week
years; our operations in Europe, Asia and Latin America are reported on
a 12 calendar-month basis ended April 30, and therefore did
not have the benefit of the 53rd week. International unit volume growth
was driven by 12 percent growth in the Asia/Pacific region:

Using constant exchange rates to translate components of earnings,
the unit volume increase in fiscal 2004 improved gross margin by
approximately $20 million; total gross margin increased by $32 million,
as net price realization maintained gross margin as a percent of sales;
selling, general and administrative costs increased $18 million; and
operating profit increased $14 million, or 15 percent over fiscal 2003.

Operating profits including the effects of foreign currency rate
changes grew to $119 million, 31 percent above last year’s $91
million.


Unallocated Corporate Expense

Unallocated corporate expense decreased from $76 million in fiscal
2003 to $17 million in fiscal 2004, driven primarily by a $36 million
decrease in merger-related costs as the integration of
Pillsbury was completed during the year.

Joint Ventures

Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings increased from $61
million in fiscal 2003 to $74 million in fiscal 2004, primarily due to
unit volume gains, as follows:

Our joint ventures do not share our fiscal year, and therefore did

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — 2003 vs. 2002

The acquisition of Pillsbury, on Oct. 31, 2001, significantly affected
fiscal 2003 comparisons for our results of operations, as our fiscal
2002 results include only seven months of ownership of the Pillsbury
businesses. Net earnings (including cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle, adopted in fiscal 2002, as described in more
detail in the section below titled “New Accounting Rules”) were
$917 million, up 100 percent from fiscal 2002. Diluted
earnings per share were $2.43 compared to $1.34 in fiscal 2002. Annual
net sales rose 32 percent, to $10.5 billion, driven by a 30 percent
increase in worldwide unit volume for fiscal 2003. The balance of the
net sales growth was primarily attributable to promotional
efficiencies. On a comparable basis, as if General Mills had owned
Pillsbury for all of fiscal 2002, worldwide unit volume grew 3 percent.
This performance reflected improvement in our U.S. Retail segment, but
was constrained by economic factors limiting growth in our Bakeries and
Foodservice segment and Latin American operations in our International
segment.

U.S. Retail unit volume comparable for Pillsbury grew 4 percent in fiscal 2003. All of our U.S. Retail divisions
experienced volume growth except Baking Products, which declined due to
significant competitive promotional activity. Net sales for these
operations totaled $7.41 billion in fiscal 2003, compared to $5.91
billion in fiscal 2002. Operating profits totaled $1.75 billion, up 66
percent from the prior year.

Bakeries and Foodservice results in fiscal 2003 included unit volume
comparable for Pillsbury that was essentially unchanged from fiscal
2002, reflecting overall weak foodservice industry trends. Net sales
reached $1.80 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to $1.26 billion in
fiscal 2002, while operating profit was $156 million, up only 1 percent
from the prior year in spite of the inclusion of twelve months of
Pillsbury results in fiscal 2003 compared to seven months of results
included in fiscal 2002.

International unit volume comparable for Pillsbury declined 1 percent
in fiscal 2003, driven by a 20 percent decline in Latin America that
was nearly offset by volume growth in Canada, Europe and Asia. Net
sales totaled $1.30 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to $778 million in
2002, and operating profits grew to $91 million, more than double the
prior year’s $45 million total.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

It is our view that changes in the general rate of inflation have
not had a significant effect on profitability over the three most
recent years other than as noted above related to commodities. We
attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate
planning and operating practices. Our market risk management practices
are discussed later in this section.

CASH FLOWS

Sources and uses of cash in the past three years are shown in the
following table. Over the most recent three-year period, General
Mills’ operations have generated $4.0 billion in cash. In 2004, cash
flow from operations totaled nearly $1.5 billion. That was down from
the previous year as a $218 million increase in operating earnings
before depreciation, amortization, deferred income taxes and
restructuring and other exit costs was more than offset by an increase
in working capital of $186 million in 2004 versus a decrease of $246
million in 2003. The increase in the use of working capital in fiscal
2004 was due primarily to three factors. One of the factors was that
the accounts payable balance as of May 30, 2004 was $158
million below last year’s balance primarily due to lower accrued
liabilities, such as trade promotion liabilities, driven by faster cash
payments. A second factor was a reduction in miscellaneous other
current liabilities of $119 million due primarily to payments against
integration and restructuring liabilities. The third factor was net
income tax payments in 2004 of $225 million versus net payments of $139
million in 2003.

In fiscal 2004, capital investment for land, buildings and
equipment, and intangibles fell to $653 million from $750 million last year, and included expenditures for the completion of
new facilities at our Minneapolis headquarters campus and expenditures
associated with the acquisition and integration of Pillsbury. We expect
capital expenditures to decrease further in fiscal 2005, to between
$450 and $500 million.

Dividends in 2004 totaled $1.10 per share, a payout of 40 percent of diluted earnings per share. The board of
directors announced a 13 percent increase in dividends to an
annual rate of $1.24 per share, effective with the dividend payable on
Aug. 2, 2004.

We did not repurchase a significant number of shares in fiscal 2004,
nor do we expect to repurchase a significant number of shares in fiscal
2005.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Our notes payable and total long-term debt totaled $8.2 billion as of May 30, 2004. We also consider our leases
and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our debt
structure, and we use a measurement of “adjusted debt plus minority
interests,” as shown in the table below. This adjusted debt plus
minority interests declined by $572 million, to $8.4 billion,
and our stockholders’ equity grew to $5.2 billion. The market value of
General Mills stockholders’ equity increased as well, as an increase
in shares outstanding was partially offset by a slight decline in share
price. As of May 30, 2004, our equity market capitalization
was $17.5 billion, based on a price of $46.05 per share and 379 million
basic shares outstanding. Our total market capitalization, including
adjusted debt, minority interests and equity capital, fell from $26.2
billion as of May 25, 2003 to $25.9 billion as of May 30, 2004.

In fiscal 2004 we refinanced $575 million of our short-term debt through the following
issuances: $500 million of 2 percent 3-year notes that were subsequently swapped to 1-month LIBOR plus
11 basis points, and a $75 million 5-year term loan at 1-month LIBOR plus 15 basis points.

We consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our
fixed-rate obligations. The next table, when reviewed in conjunction with the capital structure table, shows the
composition of our debt structure including the impact of using derivative instruments.

Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We can
issue commercial paper in the United States and Canada, as well as in
Europe, through a program established in fiscal 1999. Our commercial
paper borrowings are supported by $1.85 billion in committed credit
lines. Currently, we have no outstanding borrowings under these credit
lines. The following table details the fee-paid credit lines we had
available as of May 30, 2004.

On June 23, 2004, we filed a Universal Shelf
Registration Statement (the shelf) with the Securities and Exchange
Commission covering the sale of up to $5.943 billion of debt
securities, common stock, preference stock, depository shares,
securities warrants, purchase contracts, purchase units and units (all
described in the shelf). In addition, the shelf covers resales of an
aggregate of 49,907,680 shares of our common stock owned by an
affiliate of Diageo plc. When the shelf becomes effective, our existing
shelf registration will be incorporated therein.

We believe that two important measures of financial strength are the
ratios of fixed charge coverage and cash flow to adjusted debt plus
minority interests. Our fixed charge coverage in fiscal 2004 was 3.8
times compared to 3.2 times in fiscal 2003, and cash flow to adjusted
debt plus minority interests was 20 percent compared to 15 percent in
fiscal 2003. We expect to pay down at least $625 million of adjusted
debt plus minority interests in fiscal 2005, as part of a cumulative
$2.0 billion reduction in adjusted debt plus minority interests planned
over the three-year period ending in fiscal 2006. Our goal is to return
to a mid single-A rating for our long-term debt, and to the top tier short-term rating, where we
were prior to our announcement of the Pillsbury acquisition.

Currently, Standard and Poor’s Corporation has ratings of
“BBB+” on our publicly held long-term debt and “A-2” on our
commercial paper. Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. has ratings of
“Baa2” for our long-term debt and “P-2” for our commercial
paper. Fitch Ratings, Inc. rates our long-term debt “BBB+” and our
commercial paper “F-2.” Dominion Bond Rating Service in Canada
currently rates General Mills as “A-low.”

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

It is not our general business practice to enter into
off-balance sheet arrangements nor is it our policy to issue guarantees
to third parties. We have, however, issued guarantees of approximately
$199 million for the debt and other obligations of unconsolidated
affiliates, primarily CPW and SVE. In addition, off-balance sheet
arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under
noncancelable operating leases, which totaled approximately $435
million at May 30, 2004.

The following table summarizes our future estimated
cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including
payments due by period. The majority of the purchase obligations
represent commitments for projected raw material and packaging needs to
be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer-directed
marketing commitments that support our brands. Information concerning
other long-term liabilities that consist primarily of retirement and
other postretirement benefits and the fair value of outstanding
interest hedges has been provided in Note Fourteen and Note Seven,
respectively.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

For a complete description of our significant accounting
policies, please see Note One to the consolidated financial statements.
Our critical accounting policies are those that have meaningful impact
on the reporting of our financial condition and results, and that may
require significant management judgment and estimates. These policies
include


our accounting for trade and consumer promotion activities; asset
impairments; income taxes; and pension and postretirement
liabilities.

Trade and Consumer Promotion Activities

We report sales net of certain coupon and trade promotion
costs. The trade promotion costs include payments to customers to
perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or
in-store displays, discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf
prices, and payments to gain distribution of new products.

The amount and timing of expense recognition for
trade and consumer promotion activities involve management judgment
related to estimated participation and performance levels. The vast
majority of year-end liabilities associated with these activities are
resolved within the following fiscal year and therefore do not require
highly uncertain long-term estimates. For interim reporting, we
estimate the annual trade promotion expense and recognize pro rata
period expense generally in proportion to revenue, adjusted for
estimated year-to-date expenditures if greater than the pro rata
amount. Certain trade and consumer promotion expenses are recorded as
reductions of net sales.

Promotional funds for our retail businesses are
initially established at the beginning of each year, and paid out over
the course of the year based on the customer’s performance of
agreed-upon merchandising activity. During the year, additional funds
may also be used in response to competitive activities, as a result of
changes in the mix of our marketing support, or to help achieve interim
unit volume targets.

We set annual sales objectives and interim targets as
a regular practice to manage our business. Our sales employees are
salaried, and are eligible for annual cash incentives based on
performance against objectives set at the start of the year. These
objectives include goals for unit volume and the trade promotion cost
per unit required to achieve the unit volume goal. Our sales employees
have discretion to plan and adjust the timing of merchandising activity
over the course of the year, and they also have some discretion to
adjust the level of trade promotion funding applied to a particular
event.

Our unit volume in the last week of each quarter is
consistently higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the
quarter. In comparison to the average daily shipments in the first
12 weeks of a quarter, the final week of each quarter has
approximately two to four days’ worth of incremental shipments (based
on a five-day week), reflecting increased promotional activity at the
end of the quarter. This increased activity includes promotions to
assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support
major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early

in the next quarter, as well as promotions intended to help achieve
interim unit volume targets. This increased sales activity results in
shipments that are in direct response to orders from customers or
authorized pursuant to pre-arranged inventory-management agreements,
and accordingly are recognized as revenue within that quarter. The two
to four day range of increased unit volume in the last week of each
quarter has been generally consistent from quarter to quarter over the
last three years.

As part of our effort to assess the results of our
promotional activities, we regularly estimate the amount of “retailer
inventory” in the system — defined as product that we have shipped
to our customers that has not yet been purchased from our customers by
the end-consumer. While it is not possible for us to measure the
absolute level of inventory, we are able to estimate the change that
occurs each month by comparing our shipments to retail customers with
their sales to end-consumers (“takeaway”) as reported by ACNielsen.
Our estimate indicates inventory levels peak in November when retailers
have increased inventories to meet seasonal demand for products like
refrigerated dough and ready-to-serve soup. This seasonal trend is
generally consistent from year to year, even as retailers have taken
actions to reduce their ongoing inventory levels.

We also assess the effectiveness of our promotional
activities by evaluating the end-consumer purchases of our products
subsequent to the reporting period. If, due to quarter-end promotions
or other reasons, our customers purchase more product in any reporting
period than end-consumer demand will require in future periods, then
our sales level in future reporting periods would be adversely
affected.

As part of our ongoing evaluation of sales, we also
monitor customer returns. We generally do not allow a right of return
on our products. However, on a limited case-by-case basis with prior
approval, we may allow customers to return products in saleable
condition for redistribution to other customers or outlets. These
returns are recorded as reductions of net sales in the period of the
return. Monthly returns are consistently below 1 percent of
sales, and have averaged approximately 0.5 percent of total
monthly shipments over the last three years.

Asset Impairments

We are required to evaluate our long-lived assets,
including goodwill, for impairment and write down the value of any
assets when they are determined to be impaired. Evaluating the
impairment of long-lived assets involves management judgment in
estimating the fair values and future cash flows related to these
assets. Although the predictability of long-term cash flows may be
uncertain, our evaluations indicate fair values for our long-lived
assets and goodwill that are significantly in excess of stated book
values. Therefore, we believe the risk of unrecognized impairment is
low.


Income Taxes

Income tax expense involves management judgment as to the
ultimate resolution of any tax issues. Historically, our assessments of
the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been reasonably accurate.
The current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance
from historical items.

Pension Accounting

The accounting for pension and other postretirement
liabilities requires the estimation of several critical factors. As
detailed in Note Fourteen to the consolidated financial statements, key
assumptions that determine this income include the discount rate and
expected rate of return on plan assets.

Our discount rate assumption is determined annually based on
the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds. The
discount rate used to determine the pension and other
postretirement obligations as of the balance sheet date is the rate in
effect as of that measurement date. That same discount rate also is
used to determine pension and other postretirement income or expense
for the following fiscal year.

Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by
our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance,
our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input
from our actuaries, investment services and investment managers), and
long-term inflation assumptions.

In addition to our assumptions about the discount rate and the
expected rate of return on plan assets, we base our determination of
pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of assets which
reduces year-to-year volatility in accordance with SFAS No. 87,
“Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.” This market-related
valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period
from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this
purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using
the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the
market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value of
assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future
value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses
are recorded. As of May 30, 2004, we had cumulative losses of
approximately $770 million on our pension plans and $307 million on our
postretirement plans. These unrecognized net actuarial losses will
result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in
postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors
defined by SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106.

In fiscal 2004, we recorded net pension and postretirement
expense of $5 million compared to $42 million of income in

fiscal 2003, net of $6 million of curtailments. The discount rates used
in our pension and other postretirement assumptions were 7.5 percent
for the obligation as of May 26, 2002 and for our fiscal 2003
income and expense estimate, and 6.0 percent for the obligation as of
May 25, 2003 and for our fiscal 2004 income and expense
estimate. For fiscal 2003 we assumed a rate of return of 10.4 percent
on our pension plan assets and 10.0 percent on our other
postretirement plan assets. For fiscal 2004 we reduced our rate of
return assumptions to 9.6 percent for assets in both plans.

For our fiscal 2005 pension and other postretirement income
and expense estimate, we have increased the discount rate to 6.65
percent, based on interest rates as of May 30, 2004. The
expected rate of return on plan assets remains 9.6 percent. Based on
these rates and various other assumptions including the amortization of
unrecognized net actuarial losses, we estimate that our net pension and
postretirement expense, exclusive of curtailments, if any, will
approximate $20 million in fiscal 2005 compared to expense of $5
million, exclusive of curtailments, in fiscal 2004. Actual future net
pension and postretirement income or expense will depend on future
investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various
other factors related to the populations participating in our pension
and postretirement plans.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets
by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and
postretirement expense for fiscal 2005 by approximately $18 million. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points would
increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2005 by
approximately $23 million.

NEW ACCOUNTING RULES

On the first day of fiscal 2002, we adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” which
requires all derivatives to be recorded at fair value on the balance
sheet and establishes new accounting rules for hedging. We recorded the
cumulative effect of adopting this accounting change in fiscal 2002, as
follows:

This cumulative effect was primarily associated with the impact of
lower interest rates on the fair-value calculation for delayed-starting
interest rate swaps we entered into in anticipation of our Pillsbury
acquisition and other financing requirements. Refer to Note Seven and
Note Ten for more information.

On the first day of fiscal 2002, we also adopted SFAS No. 141,
“Business Combinations,” which requires use of the purchase method
of accounting for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.

The third Statement we adopted at the start of fiscal 2002 was
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets.” This Statement
eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead requires that
goodwill be tested annually for impairment. Transitional impairment
tests of our goodwill did not require adjustment to any of our goodwill
carrying values.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we adopted the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue
01-09, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer
or a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products,” which requires recording
certain coupon and trade promotion expenses as reductions of revenues.
Since adopting this requirement resulted only in the
reclassification of certain expenses from selling, general
and administrative expense to a reduction of net sales, it
did not affect our financial position or net earnings.

Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we adopted SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets.” The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued FASB Interpretation Number 45 (FIN 45), “Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees of Indebtedness
of Others.” FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosure requirements of
guarantees, as well as requiring the recording of certain guarantees
issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of
FIN 45 did not require any material change in our guarantee disclosures
(see Note Seventeen).

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” SFAS No. 146
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal
activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a
commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The adoption of this Standard
affected the timing of the recognition of exit or disposal costs for
disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition

and Disclosure.” SFAS No. 148 provides companies with alternative
methods of transition to the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. We have not elected the fair value
based method of accounting. SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure
about the effects on reported net income of an entity’s accounting
policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee compensation, as
reflected in Note One (L) to the consolidated financial statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.”
SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and
measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both
liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a
financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability, or as an
asset in some circumstances. SFAS No. 150 was effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and
otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period
beginning after June 15, 2003. SFAS No. 150 was implemented
in our second quarter of fiscal 2004 and did not have an effect on our
consolidated financial statements.

In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” (FIN 46). FIN 46
requires that interests in variable interest entities that
are considered to be special purpose entities be included in the
financial statements for the year ended May 30, 2004. FIN 46
was implemented in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and did not have a
material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2003, the FASB revised SFAS No. 132,
“Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits.” The revision to SFAS No. 132 requires additional
disclosures for pension and other postretirement benefits plans, which
are presented in Note Fourteen — Retirement And Other Postretirement
Benefit Plans.

The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization
Act of 2003 (Act) was signed into law on December 8, 2003.
The Act introduced a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree
health care benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that
is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare. Financial Accounting
Standards Board Staff Position 106-2 (FSP 106-2) provides accounting
guidance related to the Act. We adopted FSP 106-2 at the beginning of
our fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and it did not have a material effect
on our consolidated financial statements. See Note Fourteen
— Retirement and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.


MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Our Company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in
interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Changes in
these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows.
In the normal course of business, we actively manage our exposure to
these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions,
authorized under company policies that place clear controls on these
activities. The counterparties in these transactions are highly rated
institutions. Our hedging transactions include (but are not limited to)
the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments. We use
derivatives only where there is an underlying exposure; we do not use
them for trading or speculative purposes. Additional information
regarding our use of financial instruments is included in Note Seven to
the consolidated financial statements.

Interest Rates

— We manage our debt structure and our
interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt, and
through the use of derivatives. We use interest rate swaps to hedge our
exposure to interest rate changes, and also to reduce volatility of our
financing costs. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a
counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and
floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal
amount. Our primary exposure is to U.S. interest rates. As of May 30, 2004, we had $10.2 billion of agreed notional principal amounts
(the principal amount on which the fixed or floating interest rate is
calculated) outstanding, including amounts that neutralize exposure
through offsetting swaps (see Notes Seven and Eight to the consolidated
financial statements).

Foreign Currency Rates

— Foreign currency fluctuations can
affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign
currencies. We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts and
option contracts to selectively hedge our cash flow exposure to changes
in exchange rates. These contracts function as hedges, since they
change in value inversely to the change created in the underlying
exposure as foreign exchange rates fluctuate. Our primary exchange rate
exposures are with the Canadian dollar, the euro, the Australian
dollar, the Mexican peso and the British pound against the U.S. dollar.

Commodities

— Certain ingredients used in our products are
exposed to commodity price changes. We manage this risk through an
integrated set of financial instruments, including purchase orders,
noncancelable contracts, futures contracts, futures options and swaps.
Our primary commodity price exposures are to cereal grains, vegetables,
dairy products, sugar, vegetable oils, meats, fruits, other
agricultural products, packaging materials and energy costs.

Value at Risk

— These estimates are intended to measure the
maximum potential fair value General Mills could lose in one day from
adverse changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or
commodity prices, under normal market conditions. A Monte Carlo (VAR)
methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures. The
models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent
confidence level.

The VAR calculation used historical interest rates, foreign exchange
rates and commodity prices from the past year to estimate the potential
volatility and correlation of these rates in the future. The market
data were drawn from the RiskMetrics

TM

data set. The
calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value
that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the
derivative) inversely correlates with the underlying exposure, we would
expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would
be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the
underlying exposures. The positions included in the calculations were:
debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; and
commodity swaps, futures and options. The calculations do not include
the underlying foreign exchange and commodities-related positions that
are hedged by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.

The table below presents the estimated maximum potential one-day loss
in fair value for our interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and
equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding on May 30, 2004. The amounts were calculated using the VAR methodology
described earlier.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Stockholders and the Board of Directors

General Mills, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General
Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 30, 2004 and May 25, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in
the three-year period ended May 30, 2004. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a)2. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 30, 2004 and
May 25, 2003, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended
May 30, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein.

GENERAL MILLS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from our
estimates.

(A)    PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

– Our consolidated
financial statements include parent company operations and majority-owned subsidiaries as well as General Mills’
investment in and share of net earnings or losses of 20- to 50-percent-owned companies, which are recorded on an equity
basis.

Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in May. Fiscal year 2004 consisted of 53 weeks, and
fiscal 2003 and 2002 each consisted of 52 weeks. Our wholly owned international operations, with the exception of Canada
and our export operations, are reported for the 12 calendar months ended April 30. The results of the acquired Pillsbury
operations are reflected from November 1, 2001.

(B)    LAND, BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION

– Buildings
and equipment are depreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Buildings are
usually depreciated over 40 to 50 years, and equipment is depreciated over three to 15 years. Depreciation charges for
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $376 million, $347 million and $283 million, respectively. Accelerated
depreciation methods generally are used for income tax purposes. When an item is sold or retired, the accounts are
relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciation; the resulting gains and losses, if any, are recognized.

(C)    INVENTORIES

– Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
market. We generally use the LIFO method of valuing inventory because we believe that it is a better match with current
revenues. However, FIFO is used for most foreign operations, where LIFO is not recognized for statutory purposes.

(D)    INTANGIBLE ASSETS

– Goodwill represents the difference
between the purchase prices of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired and accounted for
by the purchase method of accounting. On May 28, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets.” This Statement eliminated the amortization of goodwill and
intangibles with indefinite lives, primarily acquired brand intangibles, and instead requires that they be tested
annually for impairment. See Note One (O) for the effects of this adoption. We capitalize the costs of software
internally developed or externally purchased for internal use. The costs of patents, copyrights and other amortizable
intangible assets are amortized evenly over their estimated useful lives.

(E)    RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

– We review
long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles and goodwill, for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An asset is deemed impaired and
written down to its fair value if estimated related future cash flows are less than its carrying amount.

(F)    FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

– For most of our foreign
operations, local currencies are considered the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated using
exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated using the average exchange
rates during the period. Translation effects are classified within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in
Stockholders’ Equity.

(G)    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

– See Note One (O) for a
description of our adoption of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”
We use interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with
foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. All hedging instruments are designated and
effective as hedges. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist or if the hedge becomes ineffective, all
changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings.
Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings.
We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to leveraged
derivatives. See Note Seven for additional information related to our financial instruments.

(H)    REVENUE RECOGNITION

– We recognize sales upon shipment
to our customers. Reported sales are net of certain coupon and trade promotion costs. Coupons are expensed when
distributed based on estimated redemptions. Trade promotions are expensed based on estimated participation and
performance levels for offered programs. We generally do not allow a right of return. However, on a limited case-by-case
basis with prior approval, we may allow customers to return product in saleable condition for redistribution to other
customers or outlets. These returns are recorded as reductions of net sales in the period of the return.

(I)    SHIPPING AND HANDLING

– Shipping and handling costs
associated with internal movements of


inventories are recorded as cost of sales and recognized when the related finished product is
shipped to the customer. Shipping costs associated with the distribution of finished product to our customers are
recorded as selling, general and administrative expense and are recognized when the related finished product is shipped
to the customer. The amount recorded in selling, general and administrative expense was $352 million, $345 million and
$243 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(J)    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

– All expenditures for
research and development are charged against earnings in the year incurred. The charges for fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002 were $158 million, $149 million and $131 million, respectively.

(K)    ADVERTISING COSTS

– Advertising expenses (including
production and communication costs) for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $512 million, $519 million
and $489 million, respectively. Prepaid advertising costs (including syndication properties) of
$25 million and $31 million were reported as assets at May 30, 2004, and May 25, 2003,
respectively. We expense the production costs of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.

(L)    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

– We use the intrinsic value
method for measuring the cost of compensation paid in Company common stock. This method defines our cost as the excess
of the stock’s market value at the time of the grant over the amount that the employee is required to pay. Our
stock option plans require that the employee’s payment (i.e., exercise price) be the market value as of the grant
date. The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net earnings and earnings per share if the company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”
to stock-based employee compensation.

The weighted average fair values at grant date of the options granted in fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002 were estimated as $8.54, $8.24 and $11.77, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following weighted average assumptions:

The Black-Scholes model requires the input of certain key assumptions, does not give effect to
restrictions that are placed on employee stock options, and therefore may not provide a reliable measure of fair
value.

(M)    EARNINGS PER SHARE

– Basic Earnings per Share (EPS) is
computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS includes the
effect of all dilutive potential common shares (primarily related to outstanding in-the-money stock options).

(N)    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

– We consider all investments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents totaling
$117 million and $211 million at May 30, 2004 and May 25, 2003, respectively, are designated as
collateral for certain derivative liabilities.


(O)    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

– On the first day of fiscal
2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” which requires all derivatives to be recorded at fair value on the balance
sheet and establishes new accounting rules for hedging. We recorded the cumulative effect of adopting this accounting
change in fiscal 2002, as follows:

$

(158

Effect on Diluted Earnings Per Share

$

(.01

)

This cumulative effect was primarily associated with the impact of lower interest rates on the
fair-value calculation for delayed-starting interest rate swaps we entered into in anticipation of our financing
requirements. Refer to Note Seven and Note Ten for more information.

On the first day of fiscal 2002, we also adopted SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations,” which requires use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001.

The third Statement we adopted at the start of fiscal 2002 was SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Intangible Assets.” This Statement eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead
requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment. Transitional impairment tests of our goodwill did not require
adjustment to any of our goodwill carrying values.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards
Board’s Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 01-09, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to
a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products,” which requires recording certain coupon and trade
promotion expenses as reductions of revenues. Since adopting this requirement resulted only in the reclassification of
certain expenses from selling, general and administrative expense to a reduction of net sales, it did not affect our
financial position or net earnings.

Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation
No. 45 (FIN 45), “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees of Indebtedness
of Others.” FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosure requirements of guarantees, as well as requiring the recording
of certain guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 did not require any
material change in our guarantee disclosures (see Note Seventeen).

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with
Exit or Disposal Activities.” SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or
disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The
adoption of this Standard affected the timing of the recognition of exit or disposal costs for disposal activities
initiated after December 31, 2002.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
– Transition and Disclosure.” SFAS No. 148 provides companies with alternative methods of transition to the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. We have not elected the fair value based
method of accounting. SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an
entity’s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee compensation, as reflected in Note
One (L) to the consolidated financial statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer
classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS
No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability, or as an
asset in some circumstances. SFAS No. 150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after
May 31, 2003, and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June 15, 2003. SFAS No. 150 was implemented in our second quarter of fiscal 2004 and did not have an effect on
our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities,” (FIN 46). FIN 46 requires that interests in variable interest entities that are considered to
be special purpose entities be included in the financial statements for the year ended May 30, 2004. FIN 46 was
implemented in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
statements.

In December 2003, the FASB revised SFAS No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures about
Pensions and Other


Postretirement Benefits.” The revision to SFAS No. 132 requires additional disclosures
for pension and other postretirement benefits plans, which are presented in Note Fourteen – Retirement And Other
Postretirement Benefit Plans.

The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Act) was signed into
law on December 8, 2003. The Act introduced a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that
provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare. Financial Accounting Standards
Board Staff Position 106-2 (FSP 106-2) provides accounting guidance related to the Act. We adopted FSP 106-2 at the
beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
statements. See Note Fourteen – Retirement and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.

2.  ACQUISITIONS

On October 31, 2001, we acquired the worldwide Pillsbury operations from Diageo plc
(Diageo). Pillsbury, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, built a portfolio of leading food brands, such as

Pillsbury

refrigerated dough,

Green Giant

,

Old El Paso

,

Progresso

and

Totino’s

. Pillsbury had sales of $6.1 billion (before
EITF Issue 01-09 reclassification) in its fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, including businesses
subsequently divested.

The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. Under terms of the agreement between General
Mills and Diageo, we acquired Pillsbury in a stock and cash transaction. Consideration to Diageo included
134 million General Mills common shares. Under a stockholders’ agreement, Diageo had a put option to sell
directly to us 55 million shares of General Mills common stock at a price of $42.14 per share, which Diageo
exercised on November 1, 2001. Therefore, those 55 million shares were valued at a total of
$2,318 million. The 79 million shares of General Mills common stock retained by Diageo were valued at
$3,576 million based on the three-day average trading price prior to the closing of $45.27 per share. Therefore,
the total stock consideration was $5,894 million. The cash paid to Diageo and assumed debt of Pillsbury on
October 31, 2001 totaled $3,830 million. Under terms of the agreement, Diageo held contingent value rights
that required payment to Diageo on April 30, 2003, of $273 million based on the average price of General Mills
stock of $45.55 per share for the 20 trading days prior to that date and the 79 million shares Diageo held. As
a result, the total acquisition consideration (exclusive of direct acquisition costs) was $9,997 million.

In order to obtain regulatory clearance for the acquisition of Pillsbury, we arranged to
divest certain dessert and specialty products businesses on November 13, 2001, for $316 million. On
December 26, 2001, Nestlé USA exercised its right to buy the 50 percent stake that it did not already own in
Ice Cream Partners USA LLC, a joint venture, for $641 million. Net proceeds from these transactions were used to
reduce our debt level.

The stockholders’ agreement between General Mills and Diageo, as amended, includes a
standstill provision, under which Diageo is precluded from buying additional shares in General Mills for a 20-year
period following the close of the transaction, or for three years following the date on which Diageo owns less than 5
percent of General Mills’ outstanding shares, whichever is earlier. The agreement also generally requires
pass-through voting by Diageo, so its shares will be voted in the same proportion as the other General Mills shares are
voted.

The allocation of the purchase price was completed in fiscal 2003. Intangible assets
included in the final allocation of the purchase price were acquired brands totaling $3.5 billion and goodwill of

3.  RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXIT COSTS

In fiscal 2004, we recorded restructuring and other exit costs of $26 million pursuant to approved plans. In the Netherlands, $6 million was
related primarily to a severance charge for 142 employees being terminated as a result of a plant closure.
Approximately $2 million was related primarily to a plant closure in Brazil. Of this amount, approximately
$1 million was related to a severance charge for 201 employees. Approximately $3 million was for the closure
of our tomato canning facility in Atwater, California.


This charge includes severance costs of approximately $1 million for 47 employees. We
recorded an additional $7 million charge, related primarily to adjustments of costs associated with previously
announced closures of manufacturing facilities. In addition, we recorded a severance charge of $8 million for
132 employees, related primarily to actions in our Bakeries and Foodservice organization. The above charges include
the write-down of $3 million of assets. The carrying value of the assets written down was $3 million.

In fiscal 2003, we recorded restructuring and other exit costs totaling $62 million
pursuant to approved plans related to the acquisition of Pillsbury. These costs consisted of $41 million of charges
associated with the closure of our St. Charles, Illinois plant, $13 million of expense relating to exiting
production at former Pillsbury facilities being closed, and $8 million for flour mill, grain and other
restructuring/closing charges. These fiscal 2003 costs include severance related to 264 St. Charles plant employees and
the write-down of $31 million of production assets, primarily the St. Charles facility. The carrying value of the
assets written down was $36 million.

In fiscal 2002, we recorded restructuring and other exit costs totaling $134 million
pursuant to approved plans, related primarily to the acquisition of Pillsbury. These costs consisted of $87 million
for severance and asset write-down costs related to the reconfiguration of cereal production to obtain regulatory
clearance for the acquisition of Pillsbury, $38 million for severance costs related to sales organization and
headquarters department realignment, and $9 million for two flour mill restructuring/closing charges. The cereal
reconfiguration charges were necessitated by the sale of our Toledo, Ohio plant as required to obtain regulatory
clearance for the acquisition of Pillsbury. The severance costs related to 1,078 employees. These employees included all
levels and a variety of areas within the Company, including management, supervisory, technical and production personnel.
The restructuring and other exit costs also included the write-down of $52 million of cereal production assets and
$6 million of flour production assets. The carrying value of these assets was $58 million, net of amounts
transferred to other facilities.

4.  INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES

We have a 50 percent equity interest in Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), a joint venture
with Nestlé that manufactures and markets ready-to-eat cereals outside the United States and Canada. We have a
40.5 percent equity interest in Snack Ventures Europe (SVE), a joint venture with PepsiCo that manufactures and
markets snack foods in continental Europe. We have a 50 percent equity interest in 8th Continent, LLC, a
domestic joint venture with DuPont to develop and market soy foods and beverages. As a result of the Pillsbury
acquisition, we have 50 percent interests in the following joint ventures for the manufacture, distribution and
marketing of

Häagen-Dazs

frozen ice cream products and novelties: Häagen-Dazs Japan K.K.,
Häagen-Dazs Korea Company Limited, Häagen-Dazs Distributors (Thailand) Company Limited, and Häagen-Dazs
Marketing & Distribution (Philippines) Inc. We also have a 50 percent interest in Seretram, a joint
venture with Co-op de Pau for the production of

Green Giant

canned corn in France.

The joint ventures are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on an equity
accounting basis. We record our share of the earnings or losses of these joint ventures. We also receive royalty
income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily research and development) and record the tax
impact of certain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships.

Our cumulative investment in these joint ventures (including our share of earnings and losses)
was $434 million, $372 million and $326 million at the end of fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. We made aggregate investments in the joint ventures of $31 million, $17 million and
$38 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We received aggregate dividends from the joint ventures of
$60 million, $95 million and $17 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Summary combined financial information for the joint ventures on a 100 percent basis follows.
Since we record our share of CPW results on a two-month lag, CPW information is included as of and for the 12
months ended March 31. The Häagen-Dazs and Seretram joint ventures are reported as of and for the 12 months
ended April 30, 2004 and April 30, 2003, and for the six months ended April 30, 2002. The SVE and 8th

impact on fiscal 2003 and 2002 earnings. Results of operations were not materially affected by a liquidation of LIFO
inventory. The difference between replacement cost and the stated LIFO inventory value is not materially different
from the reserve for LIFO valuation method.

The Company is exposed to certain market risks as a part of its ongoing business operations
and uses derivative financial and commodity instruments, where appropriate, to manage these risks. Derivatives are
financial instruments whose value is derived from one or more underlying financial instruments. Examples of underlying
instruments are currencies, equities, commodities and interest rates. In general, instruments used as hedges must be
effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged, and must be designated as a hedge at the
inception of the contract.

With the adoption of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” as of May 28, 2001, we record the fair value of all outstanding derivatives in receivables or
other liabilities. Gains and losses related to the ineffective portion of any hedge are recorded in various costs and
expenses, depending on the nature of the derivative.

Each derivative transaction we enter into is designated at inception as a hedge of risks
associated with specific assets, liabilities or future commitments, and is monitored to determine if it remains an
effective hedge. Effectiveness is based on changes in the derivative’s market value or cash flows being highly
correlated with changes in market value or cash flows of the underlying hedged item. We do not enter into or hold
derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. None of our derivative instruments is excluded from our assessment of
hedge effectiveness.

We use derivative instruments to reduce financial risk in three areas: interest rates, foreign
currency and commodities. The notional amounts of derivatives do not represent actual amounts exchanged by the parties
and, thus, are not a measure of the Company’s exposure through its use of derivatives. We enter into interest rate
swap, foreign exchange, and commodity swap agreements with a diversified group of highly rated counterparties. We enter
into commodity futures transactions through various regulated exchanges. These transactions may expose the Company to
credit risk to the extent that the instruments have a positive fair value, but we have not experienced any material
losses nor do we anticipate any losses. The Company does not have a significant concentration of risk with any single
party or group of parties in any of its financial instruments.

Qualifying derivatives are reported as part of hedge arrangements as follows:

CASH FLOW HEDGES

– Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in Other
Comprehensive Income until the underlying transaction is recorded in earnings. When the hedged item is realized, gains
or losses are reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings on
the same line item as the underlying transaction risk. When we issue fixed rate debt, the corresponding interest
rate swaps are dedesignated as hedges and the amount related to those swaps within Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income is reclassified into earnings over the life of the interest rate swaps.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION RISK – The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign
currency cash flows related primarily to third-party purchases, intercompany product shipments, and intercompany loans.
Forward contracts of generally less than 12 months duration are used to hedge some of these risks. Effectiveness is
assessed based on changes in forward rates.

INTEREST RATE RISK – The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to
existing variable-rate debt and planned future issuances of fixed-rate debt. The Company uses interest rate swaps,
including forward-starting swaps, to reduce interest rate volatility, and to achieve a desired proportion of variable
vs. fixed-rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions.

Variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with
effectiveness assessed based on either the hypothetical derivative method or changes in the present value of
interest payments on the underlying debt. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002.

PRICE RISK – The Company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of
anticipated purchases of ingredient and packaging materials. The Company uses a


combination of long cash positions with suppliers, exchange-traded futures and option
contracts and over-the-counter hedging mechanisms to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted
purchases over a period of generally less than one year. Commodity contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with
effectiveness assessed based on changes in futures prices. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was $1 million or less in
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002. Losses of $2 million were reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of
commodity cash flow hedges in fiscal 2003.

We use a grain merchandising operation to provide us efficient access to and more informed
knowledge of various commodities markets. This operation uses futures and options to hedge its net inventory position to
minimize market exposure. As of May 30, 2004, our grain merchandising operation had futures and options contracts
that essentially hedged its net inventory position. None of the contracts extended beyond May 2005. All futures
contracts and futures options are exchange-based instruments with ready liquidity and determinable market values.
Neither results of operations nor the year-end positions of our grain merchandising operation were material to the
Company’s overall results.

Unrealized losses from cash flow hedges recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as
of May 30, 2004, totaled $279 million, primarily related to interest rate swaps we entered into in contemplation of
future borrowings and other financing requirements (primarily related to the Pillsbury acquisition), which are being
reclassified into interest expense over the life of the interest rate hedge (see Note Eight regarding swaps settled or
neutralized). The estimated net amount of the existing gains and losses in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as of
May 30, 2004 that is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is $87 million pretax
expense.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

– Fair value hedges involve recognized assets, liabilities or
firm commitments as the hedged risks.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION RISK – The Company is exposed to fluctuations in the value
of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related primarily to repatriation of these investments.
Forward contracts, generally less than 12 months duration, are used to hedge some of these risks. Effectiveness is
assessed based on changes in forward rates. Effective gains and losses on these instruments are recorded as a foreign
currency translation adjustment in Other Comprehensive Income.

Our net balance sheet exposure consists of the net investment in foreign operations,
translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and amounted to approximately $1,100 million at
May 30, 2004 and approximately $700 million May 25, 2003.

INTEREST RATE RISK – The Company currently uses interest rate swaps to reduce volatility
of funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to achieve a desired proportion of variable vs. fixed-rate
debt, based on current and projected market conditions.

Fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges with
effectiveness assessed based on changes in the fair value of the underlying debt, using incremental borrowing rates
currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities. Effective gains and losses on these derivatives and the
underlying hedged items are recorded as interest expense.

The following table indicates the types of swaps used to hedge various assets and liabilities,
and their weighted average interest rates. Average variable rates are based on rates as of the end of the reporting
period. The swap contracts mature during time periods ranging from 2005 to 2014.

See Note Seven for a description of related interest-rate derivative instruments.

To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our
outstanding short-term borrowings. As of May 30, 2004, we had $1.85 billion in committed lines and
$264 million in uncommitted lines.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we entered into an agreement for a new $750 million
credit facility, expiring in January 2009. That facility replaced a $1.1 billion, 364-day facility, which expired
January 22, 2004. The new credit facility, along with our existing $1.1 billion multi-year facility that
expires January 2006, brings our total committed back-up credit amount to $1.85 billion. These revolving credit
agreements provide us with the ability to refinance short-term borrowings on a long-term basis; accordingly, a portion
of our notes payable has been reclassified to long-term debt.

LONG-TERM DEBT

– On August 11, 2003, we entered into a $75 million five
year term (callable after two years) bank borrowing agreement. The floating rate coupon is one month LIBOR plus
15 basis points and interest is payable on a monthly basis. This borrowing did not utilize any of our existing
shelf registration.

On September 24, 2003, we sold $500 million of 2% fixed-rate notes due
October 24, 2006. Interest on these notes is payable semiannually on April 24 and October 24, beginning
April 24, 2004. Concurrently, we entered into an interest rate swap for $500 million notional amount where we
receive 2% fixed interest and pay LIBOR plus 11 basis points. As of May 30, 2004, approximately
$3.5 billion remained available under our existing shelf registration statement for future use.

On October 28, 2002, we completed a private placement of zero
coupon convertible debentures with a face value of approximately $2.23 billion for gross proceeds of approximately
$1.50 billion. The issue price of the debentures was $671.65 for each $1,000 in face value, which represents a
yield to maturity of 2.00%. The debentures cannot be called by General Mills for three years after issuance and
will mature in 20 years. Holders of the debentures can require the Company to repurchase the notes on the third,
fifth, tenth and fifteenth anniversaries of the issuance. We have the option to pay the repurchase price in cash or in
stock. The debentures are convertible into General Mills common stock at a rate of 13.0259 shares for each $1,000
debenture. This results in an initial conversion price of approximately $51.56 per share and represents a premium
of 25 percent over the closing sale price of $41.25 per share on October 22, 2002. The conversion price will
increase with the accretion of the original issue discount on the debentures. Generally, except upon the occurrence of
specified events, holders of the debentures are not entitled to exercise their conversion rights until the
Company’s stock price is greater than a specified percentage (beginning at 125 percent and declining by
0.25 percent each six months) of the accreted conversion price per share.

On November 20, 2002, we sold $350 million of 3% fixed-rate notes and
$135 million of 3.901% fixed-rate notes due November 30, 2007. Interest for these notes is payable
semiannually on May 30 and November 30, beginning May 30, 2003.

In anticipation of the Pillsbury acquisition and other financing needs, we entered into
interest rate swap contracts during fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002 totaling $7.1 billion to attempt to lock in our
interest rate on associated debt. In September 2001, $100 million of these swaps expired. In connection with the
$3.5 billion notes offering in February 2002, we closed out $3.5 billion of these swaps. A portion was settled for
cash, and the remainder was neutralized with offsetting swaps. The notional amount of swaps settled for cash totaled
$1.1 billion and the net cash payment was $13 million. The


notional amount of the swaps that were neutralized with offsetting swaps totaled $2.4 billion.
During fiscal 2003, we closed out $1.985 billion of swaps due to the $1.5 billion convertible debentures
offering in October 2002 and the $485 million of notes offering in November 2002. All of these swaps had been
designated as cash flow hedges. Therefore, the mark-to-market value for these swaps has been recorded in Other
Comprehensive Income. As of May 30, 2004, the amount recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
($279 million) will be reclassified to interest expense over the remaining lives of the swap contracts (ranging
from one to nine years).

The Company has guaranteed the debt of the Employee Stock Ownership Plan; therefore, the loan
is reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as long-term debt with a related offset in Unearned Compensation in
Stockholders’ Equity.

The sinking fund and principal payments due on long-term debt are (in millions) $233,
$58, $2,037, $551 and $172 in fiscal 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. The fiscal 2005 and 2006 amounts are
exclusive of $1 million and $3 million, respectively, of interest yet to be accreted on zero coupon notes. The
notes payable that are reclassified under our revolving credit agreement are not included in these principal
payments.

9.  MINORITY INTERESTS

In April 2002, the Company and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries contributed assets
with an aggregate fair market value of approximately $4 billion to another wholly owned subsidiary, General Mills
Cereals, LLC (GMC), a limited liability company. GMC is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Company and its
subsidiaries, and has separate assets, liabilities, businesses and operations. The contributed assets consist primarily
of manufacturing assets and intellectual property associated with the production and retail sale of Big G ready-to-eat
cereals,

Progresso

soups and

Old El Paso

products. In exchange for the contribution of these assets, GMC
issued the managing membership interest and Class A and Class B preferred membership interests to wholly owned
subsidiaries of the Company. The managing member directs the business activities and operations of GMC and has fiduciary
responsibilities to GMC and its members. Other than rights to vote on certain matters, holders of the Class A and Class
B interests have no right to direct the management of GMC.

In May 2002, GMC sold approximately 30 percent of the Class A interests to an
unrelated third-party investor in exchange for $150 million. The Class A interests receive quarterly preferred
distributions at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 90 basis points. The GMC limited liability
company agreement requires that the rate of the preferred distributions for the Class A interests be reset by
agreement between the third-party investors and GMC every five years, beginning in May 2007. If GMC and the investors
fail to mutually agree on a new rate of preferred distributions, GMC must remarket the securities. Upon a failed
remarketing, the rate over LIBOR will be increased by 75 basis points (up to a maximum total of 300 basis
points following a scheduled reset date). In the event of four consecutive failed remarketings, the third-party
investors can force a liquidation and winding up of GMC.

GMC, through the managing member, may elect to redeem all of the Class A interests held
by third-party investors at any time for an amount equal to the investors’ capital accounts, plus an optional
retirement premium if such retirement occurs prior to June 2007. Under certain circumstances, GMC also may be dissolved
and liquidated, including, without limitation, the bankruptcy of GMC or its subsidiaries, failure to deliver the
preferred quarterly return, failure to comply with portfolio requirements,


breaches of certain covenants, and four consecutive failed attempts to remarket the Class A
interests. In the event of a liquidation of GMC, the third-party investors that hold the Class A interests would be
entitled to repayment from the proceeds of liquidation prior to the subsidiaries of the Company that are members of GMC.
The managing member may avoid liquidation in most circumstances by exercising an option to purchase the preferred
interests. An election to redeem the preferred membership interests could impact the Company’s liquidity by
requiring the Company to refinance the redemption price or liquidate a portion of GMC assets.

Currently, all of the Class B interests are held by a subsidiary of the Company. The Company
may offer the Class B interests and the remaining, unsold Class A interests to third-party investors on terms
and conditions to be determined.

For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash
flows of GMC are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The third-party investor’s Class
A interest in GMC is reflected as a minority interest on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company, and the return
to the third party investor is reflected as interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.

In fiscal 2003, General Mills Capital, Inc. (GM Capital), a wholly owned subsidiary, sold
$150 million of its Series A preferred stock to an unrelated third-party investor. GM Capital regularly enters
into transactions with the Company to purchase receivables of the Company. These receivables are included in the
consolidated balance sheet and the $150 million purchase price for the Series A preferred stock is reflected
as minority interest on the balance sheet. The proceeds from the issuance of the preferred stock were used to reduce
short-term debt. The return to the third-party investor is reflected as interest expense in the consolidated statements
of earnings.

10.  STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Cumulative preference stock of 5 million shares, without par value, is authorized but
unissued.

We have a shareholder rights plan that entitles each outstanding share of common stock to one
right. Each right entitles the holder to purchase one two-hundredths of a share of cumulative preference stock (or, in
certain circumstances, common stock or other securities), exercisable upon the occurrence of certain events. The rights
are not transferable apart from the common stock until a person or group has acquired 20 percent or more, or makes
a tender offer for 20 percent or more, of the common stock. Then each right will entitle the holder (other than the
acquirer) to receive, upon exercise, common stock of either the Company or the acquiring company having a market value
equal to two times the exercise price of the right. The initial exercise price is $120 per right. The rights are
redeemable by the Board of Directors at any time prior to the acquisition of 20 percent or more of the outstanding
common stock. The shareholder rights plan was specifically amended so that the Pillsbury transaction described in Note
Two did not trigger the exercisability of the rights. The rights expire on February 1, 2006. At May 30, 2004,
there were 379 million rights issued and outstanding.

The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase, from time to time, of common stock
for our treasury, provided that the number of treasury shares shall not exceed 170 million.

Through private transactions in fiscal 2003 as part of our stock repurchase program, we issued
put options for less than 1 million shares for $1 million in premiums paid to the Company. As of May 30, 2004,
no put options remained outstanding. On October 31, 2002, we purchased call options from Diageo plc on
approximately 29 million shares that Diageo currently owns. The premiums paid for the call options totaled
$89 million. The options are exercisable in whole or in part from time to time, subject to certain limitations,
during a three-year period from the date of the purchase of the calls. As of May 30, 2004, these call options for
29 million shares remained outstanding at an exercise price of $51.56 per share with a final exercise date of
October 28, 2005.

11.  STOCK PLANS

The Company uses broad-based stock plans to help ensure alignment with stockholders’
interests. The 2003 Stock Compensation Plan (“2003 Plan”) was approved by shareholders in September 2003,
increased the use of restricted stock and reduced the Company’s reliance on stock options as its principal form of
long-term compensation. A total of 9,710,278 shares are available for grant under the 2003 Plan through
December 31, 2005, the 2001 Director Plan through September 30, 2006, and the Executive Incentive Plan through
December 31, 2025. Shares available for grant are reduced by shares issued, net of shares surrendered to the
Company in stock-for-stock exercises. Options may be priced only at 100 percent of the fair market value at the
date of grant. No options now outstanding have been re-priced since the original date of grant. Options now outstanding
include some granted under the 1988, 1990, 1993, 1995, 1998 senior management and 1998 employee option plans, under
which no further rights may be granted. All options expire within 10 years and one month after the date of grant.
The stock plans provide for full vesting of options upon completion of specified service periods, or in the event of a
change of control.

Stock subject to a restricted period and a purchase price, if any (as
determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors),
may be granted to key employees under the 2003 Plan. Restricted stock,
up to 50 percent of the value of an individual’s cash incentive award,
may be granted through the Executive Incentive Plan. Certain restricted
stock awards require the employee to deposit personally owned shares
(on a one-for-one basis) with the Company during the restricted period.
The 2001 Director Plan allows each nonemployee director to annually
receive 1,000 restricted stock units convertible to common stock at a
date of the director’s choosing following his or her one-year term. In
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, grants of 1,738,581, 345,889 and 691,115
shares of restricted stock or units were made to employees and
directors with


weighted average values at grant of $46.35, $44.13 and $46.93 per share, respectively. On
May 30, 2004, a total of 3,113,279 restricted shares and units were outstanding under all plans.

SFAS No. 123 allows either a fair value based method or an intrinsic value based method of
accounting for stock-based compensation plans. We use the intrinsic value based method. Stock-based compensation expense
related to restricted stock for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $27 million, $21 million and $16 million,
respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for stock options is not reflected in net earnings, as all options
granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of
the grant. See Note One (L) for additional details.

14.  RETIREMENT AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

DEFINED-BENEFIT PLANS

– We have defined-benefit retirement plans covering most
employees. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. The hourly
plans include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the
requirements of federal law. Our principal retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess
pension assets would vest in plan participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control.

We sponsor plans that provide health-care benefits to the majority of our retirees. The
salaried health-care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We fund related
trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (Act) was signed into law on December 8, 2003. Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff
Position 106-2 (FSP 106-2) provides accounting guidance related to the Act. We adopted FSP 106-2 effective as of the
Act’s enactment date, December 8, 2003. The reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for
the Act subsidy related to past services was $54 million. The effect of the subsidy on postretirement cost for fiscal
2004 was a reduction of approximately $3 million.

We use our fiscal year-end as a measurement date for substantially all of our pension and
postretirement benefit plans.

Assumed trend rates for health-care costs have an important effect
on the amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans. If the
health-care cost trend rate increased by 1 percentage point in each
future year, the aggregate of the service and interest cost components
of postretirement expense would increase for fiscal 2004 by $7 million,
and the postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 30, 2004, would increase by $78 million. If the health-care cost
trend rate decreased by 1 percentage point in each future year, the
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of postretirement
expense would decrease for fiscal 2004 by $6 million, and the
postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 30,
2004, would decrease by $69 million.

The investment objective for the U.S. pension and
postretirement medical plans is to secure the benefit obligations to
participants at a reasonable cost to the Company. The goal is to
optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of
risk. The pension and postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified
across asset classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further
diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For
the


pension and postretirement plans, the long-term investment policy
allocations are: 35 percent to U.S. equities, 15 percent to
international equities, 10 percent to private equities, 30
percent to fixed income and 10 percent to real assets
(real estate, energy and timber). The actual allocations to
these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy
allocations based on relative market valuations.

Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset
allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our
estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from
our actuaries, investment services and investment managers), and
long-term inflation assumptions.

CONTRIBUTIONS AND FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS We expect to contribute $13
million to our pension plans and $21 million to our other
postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2005.

Certain international operations have defined-benefit pension plans
that are not presented in the tables above. These international
operations have prepaid pension assets of less than $1 million at the
end of fiscal 2004 and 2003, and they have accrued pension plan
liabilities of $5 million at the end of fiscal 2004 and $4 million as
of the end of fiscal 2003. Pension expense associated with these plans
was $3 million for fiscal 2004 and 2003.

DEFINED-CONTRIBUTION PLANS

– The Company’s total expense
related to defined-contribution plans recognized in fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002 was $20 million, $30 million and $9 million,
respectively. The General Mills Savings Plan is a defined contribution
plan that covers salaried and nonunion employees. It had net
assets of $1,668 million as of May 30, 2004, and
$1,597 million as of May 25, 2003. This plan is a
401(k) savings plan that includes a number of investment
funds and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). The ESOP’s only
assets are Company common stock and temporary cash balances. The
ESOP’s share of the total defined contribution expense was $15
million, $26 million and $3 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The ESOP’s expense is calculated by the
“shares allocated” method.

The ESOP uses Company common stock to convey benefits to employees and,
through increased stock ownership, to further align employee interests
with those of shareholders. The Company matches a percentage of
employee contributions to the ESOP with a base match plus a variable
year-end match that depends on annual results. Employees receive the
Company match in the form of common stock.

The ESOP originally purchased Company common stock principally with
funds borrowed from third parties (and guaranteed by the Company). The
ESOP shares are included in net shares outstanding for the purposes of
calculating earnings per share. The ESOP’s third-party debt is
described in Note Eight.

The Company treats cash dividends paid to the ESOP the same as other
dividends. Dividends received on leveraged shares (i.e., all shares
originally purchased with the debt proceeds) are used for debt service,
while dividends received on unleveraged shares are passed through to
participants.

The Company’s cash contribution to the ESOP is calculated so as to pay
off enough debt to release sufficient shares to make the Company match.
The ESOP uses the Company’s cash contributions to the plan, plus the
dividends received on the ESOP’s leveraged shares, to make principal
and interest payments on the ESOP’s debt. As loan payments are made,
shares become unencumbered by debt and are committed to be allocated.
The ESOP allocates shares to individual employee accounts on the basis
of the match of employee payroll savings (contributions), plus
reinvested dividends received on previously allocated shares. In fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002, the ESOP incurred interest expense of $1 million,
$1 million and $2 million, respectively. The ESOP used
dividends of $5 million, $6 million and $8 million in the
respective years, along with Company contributions of less than $1
million in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and $3 million in fiscal 2002 to
make interest and principal payments.

The number of shares of Company common stock in the ESOP is summarized
as follows:

15.  PROFIT-SHARING PLAN

The Executive Incentive Plan provides incentives to key employees who
have the greatest potential to contribute to current earnings and
successful future operations. All employees at the level of vice
president and above participate in the plan. These awards are approved
by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists
solely of independent, outside directors. Awards are based on
performance against pre-established goals approved by the Committee.
Profit-sharing expense was $16 million, $19 million and $11
million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

In fiscal 1982 and 1983 we purchased certain income tax items
from other companies through tax lease transactions. Total current
income taxes charged to earnings reflect the amounts attributable to
operations and have not been materially affected by these tax leases.
Actual current taxes payable relating to fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002
operations were increased by approximately $2 million, $6 million and
$3 million, respectively, due to the current effect of tax leases.
These tax payments do not affect taxes for statement of earnings
purposes since they repay tax benefits realized in prior years.

Of the total valuation allowance, $765 million relates to
a deferred tax asset for unrealized capital or related losses recorded
as part of the Pillsbury acquisition. In the future, if tax benefits
are realized related to these losses, the reduction in the valuation
allowance will be allocated to reduce goodwill. The other $44 million
of the valuation allowance relates to foreign operating losses, capital
losses and tax credits. In the future, if tax benefits are realized
related to these losses or credits, the reduction in the valuation
allowance will reduce tax expense.

We have not recognized a deferred tax liability for
unremitted earnings of $845 million from our foreign
operations because we do not expect those earnings to become taxable to
us in the foreseeable future and because a determination of the
potential liability is not practicable. If a portion were to be
remitted, we believe income tax credits would substantially offset any
resulting tax liability.

We have capital loss carryforwards of approximately $259 million, a majority of which will expire in 2007. Foreign operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $89 million expire
beginning in 2007, but the vast majority do not expire until 2018 or
later.

In fiscal 2004, we paid income taxes of $225 million. In fiscal 2003,
we paid income taxes of $248 million and received a $109 million refund
of fiscal 2002 tax overpayments. During fiscal 2002, we paid income
taxes of $196 million.

Some leases require payment of property taxes, insurance and
maintenance costs in addition to the rent payments. Contingent and
escalation rent in excess of minimum rent payments and sublease income
netted in rent expense were insignificant.

Noncancelable future lease commitments (in millions) are: $79 in fiscal
2005, $70 in fiscal 2006, $64 in fiscal 2007, $57 in fiscal 2008, $55
in fiscal 2009 and $110 after fiscal 2009, with a cumulative total of
$435. These future lease commitments will be partially offset by
expected future sublease receipts of $56 million.

We are contingently liable under guarantees and comfort letters for
$199 million. The guarantees and comfort letters are principally issued
to support borrowing arrangements, primarily for our joint ventures.

The Company is involved in various claims, including
environmental matters, arising in the ordinary course of
business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of
these matters, either individually or in aggregate, will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

18.  BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We operate exclusively in the consumer foods industry, with multiple
operating segments organized generally by product categories.

We aggregate our operating segments into three reportable segments: 1)
U.S. Retail; 2) Bakeries and Foodservice; and 3) International. Our U.S. Retail segment accounted for approximately
70 percent of our fiscal 2004 net sales, and reflects business with a
wide variety of grocery stores, specialty stores, drug and discount
chains, and mass merchandisers operating throughout the United States.
Our major product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat
cereals, meals, refrigerated and frozen dough products, baking
products, snacks, yogurt and organic foods. Our Bakeries and
Foodservice segment generated approximately 16 percent of fiscal 2004
net sales. This business segment consists of products marketed to
retail and wholesale bakeries, and to commercial and noncommercial
foodservice distributors and operators throughout the United States and
Canada. The remaining 14 percent of our fiscal 2004 net sales was
generated by our consolidated International businesses. These include a
retail business in Canada that largely mirrors our U.S. retail product
mix, along with retail and foodservice businesses competing in key
markets in Europe, Latin America and the Asia/Pacific region. At the
beginning of fiscal 2003, the Lloyd’s foodservice and the bakery flour
businesses were realigned from the U.S. Retail segment to the Bakeries
and Foodservice segment. All prior year amounts are restated for
comparative purposes.

During fiscal 2004, one customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for
approximately 14 percent of the Company’s consolidated net sales
and 19 percent of the Company’s sales in the U.S. Retail segment. No
other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the
Company’s consolidated net sales. In the U.S. Retail and
Bakeries and Foodservice segments, the top five customers accounted for
approximately 43 percent and 34 percent of fiscal 2004 net sales,
respectively.

Management reviews operating results to evaluate segment performance.
Operating profit for the reportable segments excludes general corporate
items, restructuring and other exit costs, merger-related costs,
interest expense and income taxes, as they are centrally managed at the
corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment
profitability reviewed by the Company’s management. Under our supply
chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse, distribution and
sales activities are substantially integrated across our operations in
order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed
assets, capital expenditures for long-lived assets, and depreciation
and amortization expenses are not maintained nor available by operating
segment.


The measurement of operating segment results is generally
consistent with the presentation of the consolidated statements of
earnings. Intercompany transactions between reportable operating
segments were not material in the periods presented.

Column

and 2002 as well as 173,652 stock units granted to or deferred by employees under the
1998 Employee Stock Plan, which was discontinued in September 2003. No future awards may
be granted under the 1998 Plan. Also includes stock units, less stock distributions,
which are attributable to (1) reinvested dividend equivalents paid on the stock
units, (2) restricted stock granted under various stock plans and deferred under the
Deferred Compensation Plan, and (3) the Company’s matching contributions credited on
deferred stock units, which are equal to the value of the Company’s matching
contributions that would have otherwise been made to an employee’s 401(k) Savings
Plan account if the employee had not deferred receipt of the Company’s common stock
under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

1998 Employee Stock Plan.

The 1998 Employee Stock Plan became effective September 28,
1998 and was discontinued in September 2003. All employees of the Company were eligible to receive grants of stock
options, restricted stock or restricted stock units under the Plan. Non-qualified stock options were available for grant
under the Plan at an option price that is 100% of the fair market value on the date the option is granted. Stock options
expire within 10 years and one month following the grant date and generally become exercisable in four years.
Awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units under the Plan were limited to 15 percent of the authorized
shares. The Plan contains provisions covering the treatment of stock options, restricted stock and stock units upon an
employee’s resignation, retirement, or death, or in the event of a change of control of the Company. Twenty-eight
million shares were authorized for issuance under the Plan. The 2003 Stock Compensation Plan, which was approved by
stockholders in September 2003, replaced the 1998 Employee Stock Plan.

Deferred Compensation Plan.

The Company’s Deferred Compensation Plan was approved
by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and became effective on May 1, 1984. The Plan is a non-qualified
compensation plan that provides for the deferral of cash incentives, common stock, restricted stock and restricted stock
units issued under the Company’s stock plans. An employee can elect to defer up to 100 percent of annual incentive
compensation, receipt of shares of common stock resulting from a stock-for-stock exercise of stock options under the
Company’s stock option plans and shares of common stock attributable to nonvested restricted stock or restricted
stock units under the Company’s restricted stock plans. Certain key and highly compensated management employees of
the Company are eligible to participate in the Plan.

Deferred Cash or Stock Unit Account.

A deferred account is established for each
participant making an election to defer compensation whether based on cash or common stock. A participant’s
deferred cash account is credited monthly with a rate of return based on the investment performance of
participant-selected 401(k) Savings Plan funds for the prior month. Dividend equivalent amounts can be paid out to the
employee or credited to an employee’s account to reflect dividends paid on the Company’s common stock, based
on the number of stock units deferred and credited to an employee’s deferred account. The Company credits the
deferred account of each participant in the Plan with an additional amount, or in the case of a stock unit account
additional stock units, equal to the value of the employer matching contributions that the Company would have otherwise
made to the participant’s 401(k) Savings Plan account if the employee had not deferred compensation under the
Plan.
