                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
     General Mills,  Inc. was  incorporated  in Delaware in 1928. The Company is
engaged in the manufacture  and marketing of consumer foods products.  The terms
"General  Mills,"  "Company" and "Registrant"  mean General Mills,  Inc. and its
subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.

     The Company is a leading  producer of packaged  consumer  foods and markets
its  products  primarily  through  its own  sales  organizations,  supported  by
advertising  and other  promotional  activities.  Such  products  are  primarily
distributed directly to retail food chains, cooperatives,  membership stores and
wholesalers.  Certain  food  products,  such  as  yogurt  and  some  foodservice
products, are sold through distributors and brokers.

     The packaged  consumer  foods market is highly  competitive,  with numerous
competitors  of varying  sizes.  The principal  methods of  competition  include
product quality, advertising, promotion and price. In most of its consumer foods
lines,  described  below,  General  Mills  competes  not only with other  widely
advertised  branded  products,  but also with generic products and private label
products, which are generally sold at lower prices.

     CEREALS. General Mills produces and sells a number of ready-to-eat cereals,
including such brands as: CHEERIOS, HONEY NUT CHEERIOS,  FROSTED CHEERIOS, APPLE

produces  family  flour  under the GOLD MEDAL  brand,  introduced  in 1880,  and
regional  brands  such as LA PINA,  ROBIN HOOD AND RED BAND.  The  Company  also
engages  in  grain   merchandising,   produces  flour  for  internal  ingredient
requirements and sells flour to bakery, foodservice and manufacturing markets.

     DINNER AND SIDE DISH PRODUCTS.  General Mills  manufactures a line of BETTY
CROCKER dry  packaged  dinner mixes under the  HAMBURGER  HELPER and TUNA HELPER
trademarks.  Also  under the BETTY  CROCKER  trademark,  the  Company  sells dry
packaged specialty potatoes, POTATO BUDS instant mashed potatoes, SUDDENLY SALAD

portable  tube, in fiscal 1999.  The Colombo yogurt  business  manufactures  and
sells a variety of  refrigerated  cup yogurt  products  under the COLOMBO  brand
name.

     FOODSERVICE.  The Foodservice division markets General Mills branded baking
mixes,  cereals,  snacks,  dinner  and  side  dish  products,  refrigerated  and
soft-serve   frozen   yogurt  and  custom   products  to  the   commercial   and
non-commercial sectors, including schools, colleges, hotels, restaurants and the
healthcare industry.

     INTERNATIONAL FOODS OPERATIONS. The International Foods organization of the
Company  exports  packaged food products and snack pellets  throughout the world

region.  General Mills Canada,  Inc.  sells BIG G  ready-to-eat  cereals,  BETTY
CROCKER side dishes, baking and packaged dinner mixes and fruit, grain and salty
snacks in Canada.

     The Company is engaged in four international joint ventures.  See Note Four
to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  appearing  on  pages  25  and 26 of the
Company's 1998 Annual Report to Stockholders,  incorporated herein by reference.

formed to manufacture and sell savory snacks in the People's  Republic of China.
Operations  are  expected  to  commence  in 1999.  The  Company has a 50% equity

GENERAL INFORMATION
     TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS.  The Company's products are marketed and businesses
operated under trademarks and service marks owned by or licensed to the Company.
Trademarks  and  service  marks are vital to the  Company's  business.  The most
significant  trademarks  and service  marks of the Company are  contained in the
business discussions above.

     The Company  considers that, taken as a whole, the rights under its various
patents,  which expire from time to time, are a valuable asset,  but the Company
does not believe that its businesses  are  materially  dependent upon any single
patent or group of related patents.  Outside its joint venture  activities,  the
Company's  activities  under licenses or other franchises or concessions are not
material.

     RAW  MATERIALS AND  SUPPLIES.  The principal raw materials  used by General
Mills are cereal grains, sugar, fruits, other agricultural  products,  vegetable
oils, and plastic and paper for packaging materials.  Although General Mills has
some  long-term  contracts,  the majority of such raw materials are purchased on
the open market.  Prices of most raw materials  will probably  increase over the
long term. Nonetheless, General Mills believes that it will be able to obtain an
adequate supply of needed ingredients and packaging materials.  Occasionally and
where possible,  General Mills makes advance  purchases of items  significant to
its  business  in  order to  ensure  continuity  of  operations.  The  Company's
objective is to procure  materials  meeting both the Company's quality standards
and its production needs at the lowest total cost to the Company.  The Company's
strategy is to buy these  materials at price levels that allow a targeted profit
margin.  Since  commodities  generally  represent  the largest  variable cost in
manufacturing the Company's products, to the extent possible, the Company hedges
the risk associated with adverse price movements using  exchange-traded  futures
and options and forward cash contracts. These tools enable the Company to manage
the related  commodity price risk over periods of time that exceed the period of
time in which the physical commodity is available. Accordingly, the Company uses
hedging to mitigate the risks associated with adverse price movements and not to
speculate  in the  marketplace.  See also Note Seven to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements  appearing on pages 27 and 28 of the Company's  1998 Annual Report to
Stockholders,  incorporated herein by reference and the "Market Risk Management"
subsection  of the  section  entitled  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis"
appearing  on  pages  17  and  18  of  the  Company's   1998  Annual  Report  to
Stockholders, incorporated herein by reference.

     CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES.  During the three  fiscal  years ended May 31, 1998,
General Mills expended $475 million for capital expenditures,  not including the
cost of acquired  companies.  The Company  expects to spend  approximately  $215
million for such purposes in fiscal 1999.

     RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  The main research and development facilities are
located  at the James  Ford Bell  Technical  Center in Golden  Valley  (suburban
Minneapolis),  Minnesota.  With a staff of  approximately  850,  the  Center  is
responsible  for  most  of the  food  research  for the  Company.  Approximately
one-half  of  the  staff  hold  degrees  in  various  chemical,  biological  and
engineering    sciences.    Research   and   development    expenditures    (all
Company-sponsored)  amounted to $66.3  million in fiscal 1998,  $61.4 million in
fiscal  1997 and $60.1  million in fiscal  1996.  General  Mills'  research  and
development   resources  are  focused  on  new  product   development,   product
improvement, process design and improvement,  packaging and exploratory research
in new business areas.

     EMPLOYEES.  At  May  31,  1998,  General  Mills  had  approximately  10,200
employees.

     ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS.  As of June 30,  1998,  the  Company  has  received
notices  advising  it that there have been  releases or  threatened  releases of
hazardous  substances  or wastes at 12 sites,  and alleging  that the Company is
potentially  responsible for cleaning up those sites and/or paying certain costs
in  connection  with  those  sites.  These  matters  involve  several  different
procedural contexts,  including litigation initiated by governmental authorities
and/or  private  parties,  administrative  proceedings  commenced by  regulatory
agencies,  and demand  letters  issued by  regulatory  agencies  and/or  private
parties.  The Company recognizes that its potential exposure with respect to any
of these sites may be joint and  several,  but has  concluded  that its probable
aggregate  exposure is not material.  This conclusion is based upon, among other
things,  the Company's  payments  and/or accruals with respect to each site; the
number, ranking, and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties
identified  at each of the  sites;  the  status  of the  proceedings,  including
various settlement agreements,  consent decrees or court orders;  allocations of
volumetric waste contributions and allocations of relative  responsibility among
potentially  responsible parties developed by regulatory agencies and by private
parties;  remediation  cost estimates  prepared by  governmental  authorities or
private  technical  consultants;  and the  Company's  historical  experience  in
negotiating and settling disputes with respect to similar sites.

     Based on current  facts and  circumstances,  General  Mills  believes  that
neither the results of these  proceedings  nor its  compliance  in general  with
environmental  laws or regulations  will have a material adverse effect upon the
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.

     SEGMENT INFORMATION.  Reporting financial  information relating to industry
segments  of  General  Mills  was  discontinued  as of May  28,  1995  with  the
distribution of the restaurant  business.  Geographic  financial  information is
found in Note Nineteen to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on page 33
of the Company's  1998 Annual  Report to  Stockholders,  incorporated  herein by
reference.

from  historical  earnings and those  presently  anticipated  or projected.  The
Company  wishes to  caution  readers  not to place  undue  reliance  on any such
forward-looking statements,  which speak only as of the date made. In connection
with the "safe harbor"  provisions of the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform
Act of 1995, the Company is identifying  important factors that could affect the
Company's financial performance and could cause the Company's actual results for
future periods to differ  materially  from any opinions or statements  expressed
with respect to future periods in any current statements.

     Our future  results  could be  affected  by a variety  of  factors  such as
competitive dynamics in the U.S.  ready-to-eat cereal market,  including pricing
and  promotional  spending  levels  by  premium  branded  manufacturers  and  by
lower-priced bagged cereal and private label competitors.  Results could also be
affected by other external factors such as: economic  conditions;  the impact of
competitive products and pricing;  product  development;  actions of competitors
other  than as  described  above;  changes  in laws and  regulations,  including
changes in accounting standards;  customer demand;  effectiveness of advertising
and  marketing  spending or  programs;  consumer  perception  of  health-related
issues; fluctuations in the cost and availability of supply-chain resources; and
foreign economic conditions, including currency rate fluctuations.

     The Company  specifically  declines to undertake any obligation to publicly
revise any  forward-looking  statements that have been made to reflect events or
circumstances  after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of
anticipated or unanticipated events.

The Stockholders and the Board of Directors
General Mills, Inc.:

     Under date of June 30, 1998, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets
of General Mills,  Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 31, 1998 and May 25, 1997 and
the related consolidated  statements of earnings,  stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year  period ended May 31, 1998,
as  contained  in the 1998 annual  report to  stockholders.  These  consolidated
financial statements and our report thereon are incorporated by reference in the
annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 1998. In connection
with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we have
also  audited  the  related  financial  statement  schedule  as  listed  in  the
accompanying  index. This financial  statement schedule is the responsibility of
the Company's  management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on this
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

     In our opinion,  such  financial  statement  schedule,  when  considered in
relation  to the  basic  consolidated  financial  statements  taken  as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

     Our report covering the basic consolidated  financial  statements refers to
changes in the method of accounting in fiscal 1997 for  impairment of long-lived
assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of.

                       RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES



   For purposes of computing  the ratio of earnings to fixed  charges,  earnings
represent  pretax income from  continuing  operations,  plus pretax  earnings or
losses of joint  ventures,  plus fixed  charges (net of  capitalized  interest).
Fixed charges represent interest (whether expensed or capitalized) and one-third
(the  proportion  deemed  representative  of the  interest  factor)  of rents of
continuing operations.
