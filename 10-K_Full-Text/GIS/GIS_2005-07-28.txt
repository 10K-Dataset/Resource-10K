Our management reviews operating results to evaluate segment performance.
Operating profit for the reportable segments excludes unallocated corporate items (including foreign currency transaction losses
of $6 million, $2 million and less than $1 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively); interest, including
minority interest, expense; restructuring and other exit costs; gain on divestitures; debt repurchase costs; income taxes;
and earnings from joint ventures as they are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of
segment profitability


reviewed by management. Under our supply chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse and distribution
activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result,
fixed assets, capital expenditures for long-lived assets, and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained
nor available by operating segment.

Financial information for our reportable business segments is set forth in
Note Eighteen to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 53 through 54 in Item Eight of this report.

JOINT VENTURES

In addition to our consolidated operations, we manufacture and sell products
through several joint ventures.

Domestic Joint Venture.

We have a 50 percent equity interest in 8th
Continent, LLC, a joint venture formed with DuPont to develop and market soy-based products. This venture began marketing a
line of

8th Continent

soymilk to limited markets in July 2001 and nationally in June 2003.

International Joint Ventures.

We have a 50 percent equity interest in
Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), a joint venture with Nestlé S.A., that distributes cereal products in more than 130
countries and republics. The cereal products marketed by CPW under the umbrella

Nestlé

trademark in fiscal 2005
included:

Chocapic

,

Cini Minis

,

Cookie Crisp

, Corn Flakes,

Crunch

,

Fitness

,

Fitness and
Fruit

,

Honey Nut Cheerios

,

Cheerios

,

Nesquik

,

Shredded Wheat

and

Shreddies.

CPW
also markets cereal bars in several European countries and manufactures private label cereals for customers in the United Kingdom.

We have a 50 percent interest in each of four joint ventures for the
manufacture, distribution and marketing of

Häagen-Dazs

frozen ice cream products and novelties in Japan, Korea,
Thailand and the Philippines. We also have a 50 percent interest in Seretram, a joint venture with Co-op de Pau for the production
of

Green Giant

canned corn in France.

See Note Four to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on page 36
in Item Eight of this report.

COMPETITION

The consumer foods market is highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers
of varying sizes in the United States and throughout the world. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments
include superior product quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovation and price. In most product
categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with generic products and private label
products, which are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we compete primarily with local manufacturers, and each
country includes a unique group of competitors.

CUSTOMERS

During fiscal 2005, one customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately
16 percent of our consolidated net sales and 22 percent of our sales in the U.S. Retail segment. No other customer accounted
for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. The top five customers in our U.S. Retail segment accounted for approximately
45 percent of its fiscal 2005 net sales. For our Bakeries and Foodservice segment, the top five customers accounted for
approximately 34 percent of its fiscal 2005 net sales.

SEASONALITY

In general, demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year.
However, demand for our refrigerated dough, frozen baked goods and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter.
Demand for

Progresso

soup and

Green Giant

canned and frozen vegetables is higher during the fall and winter months.
Internationally, demand for

Häagen-Dazs

ice cream is higher during the summer months and demand for baking mix
and dough products increases during winter months. Due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends, as well as the different
seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres, our international net sales are generally evenly balanced throughout the
year.


GENERAL INFORMATION

Trademarks and Patents.

Trademarks and service marks are vital to our
businesses. Our products are marketed under trademarks and service marks that are owned by or licensed to us. The most significant
trademarks and service marks used in our businesses are set forth in

italics

in the business discussions above. These
marks include the trademarks used in our international joint ventures that are owned by or licensed to the joint ventures.
In addition, some of our products are marketed under or in combination with trademarks that have been licensed from others,
including

Yoplait

yogurt,

Reese’s Puffs

cereal,

Hershey’s

chocolate included with a variety
of products, and a variety of characters and brands used on fruit snacks, including

Sunkist, Shrek

,

Care Bears

and various Warner Bros. characters. U.S. trademark and service mark registrations are generally for a term of 10 years, renewable
every 10 years as long as the trademark is used in the regular course of trade.

J. M. Smucker Company (Smucker) holds an exclusive royalty-free license to
use the

Doughboy

trademark and

Pillsbury

brand in the dessert mix and baking mix categories. The license is renewable
without cost in 20-year increments at Smucker’s discretion.

Given our focus on developing and marketing innovative, proprietary products,
we consider the collective rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset, but we do not
believe that our businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.

Raw Materials and Supplies.

The principal raw materials that we use are
grains, sugar, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, meats, vegetable oils, other agricultural products, plastic and paper packaging
materials, operating supplies and energy. We have some long-term fixed price contracts, but the majority of our raw materials
are purchased on the open market. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed ingredients and packaging
materials. Occasionally and where possible, we make advance purchases of items significant to our business in order to ensure
continuity of operations. Our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production needs
at the lowest total cost to us. Our strategy is to buy these materials at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin.
Since commodities generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our products, to the extent possible, we hedge
the risk associated with adverse price movements using exchange-traded futures and options, forward cash contracts and over-the-counter
derivatives. These tools enable us to manage the related commodity price risk over periods of time that exceed the period of
time in which the physical commodity is available. See also Note Seven to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on
pages 38 through 40 in Item Eight of this report and the “Market Risk Management” section of Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations appearing on pages 22 through 23 in Item Seven of this report.

Capital Expenditures.

During the fiscal year ended May 29, 2005,
our aggregate capital expenditures for fixed assets and intangibles amounted to $434 million. We expect to spend approximately
$450 million for capital projects in fiscal 2006, primarily for fixed assets to support further growth and increase supply
chain productivity.

Research and Development.

Major research and development facilities
are located at the Riverside Technical Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota and the James Ford Bell Technical Center in Golden
Valley (suburban Minneapolis), Minnesota. Our research and development resources are focused on new product development, product
improvement, process design and improvement, packaging and exploratory research in new business areas. Research and development
expenditures amounted to $168 million in fiscal 2005, $158 million in fiscal 2004 and $149 million in fiscal 2003.

Employees.

At May 29, 2005, we had approximately 27,800 full- and
part-time employees.

Food Quality and Safety Regulation.

The manufacture and sale of consumer
food products is highly regulated. In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various government agencies,
including the Food and Drug Administration, United States Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of
Commerce and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Our business is also regulated by
similar agencies outside of the United States.


Environmental Matters.

As of June 2005, we
were involved with the following active cleanup sites associated with the alleged release or threatened release of hazardous
substances or wastes:

Site

Chemical of Concern

Central Steel Drum,

Newark, NJ

No single hazardous material specified

East Hennepin,

Minneapolis, MN

Trichloroethylene

GBF/Pittsburgh,

Antioch, CA

No single hazardous material specified

King’s Road Landfill,

Toledo, OH

No single hazardous material specified

Kipp, KS

Carbon tetrachloride

Northside Sanitary Landfill,

Zionsville, IN

No single hazardous material specified

Operating Industries,

Los Angeles, CA

No single hazardous material specified

PET,

St. Louis, MO

Tetrachloroethylene

Sauget Landfill,

Sauget, IL

No single hazardous material specified

Shafer Metal Recycling,

Minneapolis, MN

Lead

Safer Textiles,

Moonachie, NJ

Tetrachloroethylene

Stuckey’s,

Doolittle, MO

Petroleum fuel products

These matters involve several different actions, including litigation initiated
by governmental authorities and/or private parties, administrative proceedings commenced by regulatory agencies, and demand
letters by regulatory agencies and/or private parties. Of the 12 matters in the table above, we are a party to current litigation
related to one cleanup site:

•

West Coast Home Builders, Inc. v. Ashland Inc., et al.

involves a claim for an unspecified amount
of damages for the diminished value of property adjacent to a State of California superfund site. The cleanup of the site is
covered by an existing settlement agreement between the State of California and a group of the potentially responsible parties,
including us. The complaint was filed last year naming numerous parties including us, but we have not yet been served. In addition,
the potentially responsible parties have an insurance policy that covers the costs of cleanup in excess of amounts already
paid, including third party claims related to the site. The insurer is defending, under a reservation of rights, its insureds
that have been named and served. We believe the claims are covered by the insurance policy and that even if we are served we
do not have any financial exposure as a result of this litigation.

•

SPPI-Sommerville Inc., et al v. TRC Companies, Inc., et al.

involves a claim for an unspecified
amount of damages for the diminished value of another parcel of property adjacent to the same State of California superfund
site as the West Coast Home Builders claim. This claim has been filed with the court but has not yet been served on us. As
with the West Coast Home Builders claim, the potentially responsible parties have an insurance policy that covers the costs
of cleanup in excess of amounts already paid, including third party claims related to the site. The insurer is defending, under
a reservation of rights, its insureds that have been named and served. We believe the claims are covered by the insurance policy
and that even if we are served we do not have any financial exposure as a result of this litigation.

We recognize that our potential exposure with respect to any of these sites
may be joint and several, but have concluded that our probable aggregate exposure is not material. This conclusion is based
upon, among other things, our payments and/or accruals with respect to each site; the number, ranking and financial strength
of other potentially responsible parties identified at each of the sites; the status of the proceedings, including various
settlement agreements, consent decrees or court orders; allocations of volumetric waste contributions and allocations of relative
responsibility among potentially responsible parties developed by regulatory agencies and by private parties; remediation cost
estimates prepared by governmental authorities or private technical consultants; and our historical experience in negotiating
and settling disputes with respect to similar sites.

Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, and the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide


and Rodenticide Act, and all similar state environmental laws applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Based on current facts and circumstances, we believe that neither the results
of our environmental proceedings nor our compliance in general with environmental laws or regulations will have a material
adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Item 7

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

We are a global consumer foods company. We develop differentiated food products
and market these value-added products under unique brand names. We work continuously on product innovation to improve
our established brands and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build
the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing and innovative merchandising. We believe our brand-building
strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe.

Our businesses are organized into three segments. Our U.S. Retail segment
accounted for approximately 69 percent of our fiscal 2005 net sales, and reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores;
specialty stores; drug, dollar and discount chains; and mass merchandisers operating throughout the United States. Our major
product categories in this business segment are: ready-to-eat cereals, meals, refrigerated and frozen dough products, baking
products, snacks, yogurt and organic foods. Our Bakeries and Foodservice segment generated approximately 16 percent of fiscal
2005 net sales. This business segment consists of products marketed to retail and wholesale bakeries, to commercial and noncommercial
foodservice distributors and operators, and to convenience stores throughout the United States and Canada. The remaining 15
percent of our fiscal 2005 net sales was generated by our consolidated International businesses. These include a retail business
in Canada that largely mirrors our U.S. retail product mix, along with retail and foodservice businesses competing in key
markets in Europe, Latin America and the Asia/Pacific region. In addition to these consolidated operations, we participate
in several joint ventures. We record our proportionate share of after-tax earnings or losses from these ventures.

Our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders
over the long term by delivering growth in sales and earnings while improving return on capital, coupled with an attractive
dividend yield. In the most recent fiscal year, General Mills’ total return to stockholders was 11 percent, while the
S&P 500 Index returned 9 percent; from fiscal 2000 to 2005, General Mills’ total return to stockholders averaged 7 percent
while the S&P 500 Index posted a negative 1 percent average annual return over this period.

For the fiscal year ended May 29, 2005, our net sales grew 2 percent
and diluted earnings per share grew 18 percent including the benefit of gains on divestitures. Details of our financial results
are provided in the “Results of Operations” section below. Our cash flow in 2005 was strong, enabling us to increase
our dividend payments, continue to make significant fixed asset investments to support future growth and productivity, and
reduce our total debt by $2.0 billion.

Results for fiscal 2005 were limited by two principal factors. First, higher
commodity costs led to a reduction in our gross margin. Second, we increased list and/or targeted promoted prices in several
categories in order to partially offset the higher commodity costs. In some instances, price gaps developed versus competitors,
and we subsequently increased trade promotion costs in order to remain competitive. This was particularly true for promoted
prices in the cereal category, where the price gap led to reduced volume and profit for the Big G cereal division. However,
slight profit growth in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment was encouraging, as was the continued success of our international
expansion plans.

As we begin fiscal 2006, we are encouraged by the momentum in several of our key
businesses. Sustaining that momentum and restoring growth in our U.S. cereal business will be key to achieving our targeted
results in 2006. In addition, we must renew good earnings growth in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. We face several challenges
that will hinder earnings growth in the year ahead. Commodity prices continue to rise, although not as quickly as they did
in 2005, and energy costs and our salary and benefit expense are expected to be higher. These increasing costs will negatively
impact our margins; therefore, in order for our plan to be successful we must restore growth in our margin rate. To offset
the increasing costs and grow margins, our plans call for continued realization of price increases we announced in fiscal 2005
combined with productivity savings through supply chain and administrative cost-saving efforts.

We believe the key driver of our success in 2006 will be operating profit
growth, which will be driven by product innovation and net sales growth. Our business plans include new product activity and
innovations that respond to consumers’ interest in health and nutrition, convenience and new flavor varieties.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — 2005 VS. 2004

Our net sales for fiscal 2005 were $11.2 billion, an increase of 2 percent
for the year compared to sales in fiscal 2004. Excluding the effect of the 53rd week in 2004, net sales increased 3 percent.
The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table:

Net Sales Growth

+2%

The unit volume growth in fiscal 2005 contributed approximately $17 million
in gross margin improvement (net sales less cost of sales) over fiscal 2004. However, overall gross margin decreased by $77
million, primarily due to increased cost of sales driven primarily by approximately $170 million in commodity cost increases.
As a result, gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 130 basis points versus fiscal 2004 to 39 percent in fiscal 2005.

Selling, general and administrative costs decreased by $25 million from
fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005, primarily driven by four factors: a $54 million decrease in consumer marketing expense, a $37 million
increase in distribution costs, a $32 million increase in unallocated corporate items and a $34 million decrease in merger-related
costs. These merger-related costs were items related to the planning and execution of the integration of Pillsbury.

Net interest expense decreased 10 percent from $508 million in fiscal 2004
to $455 million in fiscal 2005, primarily due to reduction of debt levels. Interest expense includes preferred distributions
paid on subsidiary minority interests. We have in place a net amount of interest rate swaps that convert $645 million of fixed-rate
debt to floating rates. Taking into account the effect of our interest rate swaps, the average interest rate on our total outstanding
debt and subsidiary minority interests was 5.4 percent.

Restructuring and other exit costs were $84 million in fiscal 2005. These
charges were primarily associated with the supply chain initiatives to further increase asset utilization and reduce manufacturing
and sourcing costs. The actions included plant closures and production realignment resulting in asset write-downs, severance
and related costs. Our fiscal 2004 results included restructuring and other exit costs of $26 million.

We recorded a gain of $499 million on two divestitures in fiscal 2005. On
February 28, 2005, Snack Ventures Europe (SVE), our snacks joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc., was terminated and our 40.5
percent interest was redeemed. On April 4, 2005, we sold our Lloyd’s barbecue business to Hormel Foods Corporation.
We received $799 million in cash proceeds from these dispositions and the proceeds were used to repurchase debt. In fiscal
2005, we earned $28 million after tax from SVE and Lloyd’s.

We incurred $137 million in debt repurchase costs in fiscal 2005 resulting
from the repurchase of $760 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6% Notes due in 2012. The costs consisted
of $73 million of noncash interest rate swap losses reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, $59 million of
purchase premium and $5 million of non-cash unamortized cost of issuance expense.

In fiscal 2005 our effective income tax rate increased to 36.6 percent, driven
primarily by the tax impacts of our fiscal 2005 divestitures. The higher book tax expense related to the fiscal 2005 divestitures
did not result in the payment of significant cash taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 35 percent in fiscal 2004. We expect
our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 to be approximately 35.5 percent.

After-tax earnings from joint venture operations grew 20 percent to reach
$89 million in fiscal 2005, compared with $74 million reported a year earlier. This increase was primarily due to unit volume
gains by our continuing joint ventures. As of May 29, 2005, we were a 50 percent partner in several joint ventures. Our
international joint ventures include Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), our joint venture with Nestlé, and Häagen-Dazs
joint ventures in Asia. 8

th

Continent is our domestic joint venture with DuPont to develop and market soy beverages.
On February 28, 2005, we announced the redemption of our 40.5 percent share of SVE as described above.

Our results of operations reflect the adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No. 04–8 (EITF 04–8), “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share.”
The effect of EITF 04-8 reduced our fiscal 2005 diluted earnings per share by $0.19, and


reduced previously reported diluted earnings per share by $0.15 and $0.08 for fiscal 2004 and 2003,
respectively, related to our contingently convertible debt issued in 2002.

Average diluted shares outstanding were 409 million in fiscal 2005, down
1 percent from 413 million in fiscal 2004 as the repurchase of 17 million shares from Diageo was partially offset by stock
option exercises.

Net income increased to $1.24 billion in fiscal 2005, from $1.06 billion in
2004. Earnings per diluted share of $3.08 in 2005 were up 18 percent from $2.60 in 2004 primarily due to the redemption of
our SVE interest, the sale of Lloyd’s and the reduction in interest expense.

OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS

U.S. Retail Segment

Net sales for our U.S. Retail operations totaled $7.78 billion in fiscal 2005,

The unit volume growth in fiscal 2005 contributed approximately $13 million
in gross margin improvement over fiscal 2004, but overall gross margin decreased by $144 million. Cost of sales increased by
$161 million, driven primarily by commodity cost increases, and net pricing realization (defined as the impact of list and
promoted price increases net of increases in trade promotion costs) did not contribute to offset those increased costs. Gross
margin as a percent of net sales decreased 200 basis points versus fiscal 2004 to 43 percent in fiscal 2005.

Selling, general and administrative costs decreased by $54 million, primarily
due to decreases in consumer marketing spending.

Operating profits declined to $1.72 billion, down from $1.81 billion
in fiscal 2004.

Bakeries and Foodservice Segment

Net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice operations decreased slightly to
$1.74 billion in fiscal 2005 compared to $1.76 billion in fiscal 2004. The components of the change in net sales are shown
in the following table:

The unit volume decline in fiscal 2005 reduced gross margin by approximately
$22 million compared to fiscal 2004. However, overall gross margin increased by $5 million as an increase in cost of sales
was offset by positive net pricing realization. Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased slightly versus fiscal 2004
to 26 percent in fiscal 2005.

Selling, general and administrative costs increased by only $3 million.

Operating profits increased from $132 million in fiscal 2004 to $134 million
in fiscal 2005.


International Segment

Net sales for our International operations totaled $1.72 billion in fiscal
2005 compared to $1.55 billion in 2004. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table:

Using constant exchange rates to translate components of earnings, the unit
volume increase in fiscal 2005 improved gross margin by approximately $27 million; overall gross margin increased by $52 million,
as net price realization more than offset increases in cost of sales; gross margin as a percent of sales improved to 35 percent;
selling, general and administrative costs increased $10 million; and operating profit increased $42 million, or 35 percent
over fiscal 2004.

Operating profits including the favorable effects of foreign currency rate
changes grew to $171 million, 44 percent above last year’s $119 million.

UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS

Unallocated corporate items were $32 million in expense in fiscal 2005, including
$18 million in costs (classified as cost of sales) associated with restructuring and other exit activities. Fiscal 2004 expense
was $17 million, including merger-related costs of $34 million. The primary factors accounting for the remaining variance were
severance costs of $21 million in fiscal 2005 that were not associated with restructuring and other exit activities, and an
increase of $9 million in stock-based compensation expense.

JOINT VENTURES

Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings increased from $74 million in
fiscal 2004 to $89 million in fiscal 2005, primarily due to unit volume gains in our continuing ventures, as follows:

Our interest in SVE was redeemed in February 2005, and therefore is excluded

Our joint ventures do not share our fiscal year, and therefore did not have
the benefit of a 53rd week in fiscal 2004.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — 2004 VS. 2003

Net earnings for the 53-week fiscal 2004 were $1.06 billion, up 15 percent
from fiscal 2003. Diluted earnings per share were $2.60 compared to $2.35 in fiscal 2003, as adjusted for the effects of EITF
04-8. Annual net sales rose 5 percent, to $11.1 billion, driven by a 3 percent increase in worldwide unit volume and a 2 percent
increase in net price realization, including foreign exchange. Excluding the effect of the 53rd week, net sales increased 4
percent. This performance reflected improvement in our U.S. Retail and International segments, but was constrained by economic
and internal factors limiting growth in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment.

U.S. Retail unit volume grew 4 percent in fiscal 2004, or 2 percent excluding
the 53rd week. All of our U.S. Retail divisions experienced volume growth, fueled by an increase in product and marketing innovation.
Net sales


for these operations totaled $7.76 billion in fiscal 2004, compared to $7.41 billion in fiscal 2003.
Operating profits totaled $1.81 billion, up 3 percent from $1.75 billion in the prior year.

Bakeries and Foodservice results in fiscal 2004 included a unit volume decline
of 3 percent, or 4 percent excluding the extra week, reflecting softness in our bakery business and elimination of low-margin
product lines. Net sales fell slightly to $1.76 billion in fiscal 2004 compared to $1.80 billion in fiscal 2003, while operating
profit declined 15 percent from $156 million in fiscal 2003 to $132 million in fiscal 2004.

International unit volume increased 5 percent in fiscal 2004, or 4 percent
excluding the extra week, driven by growth in the Asia/Pacific region, Canada and Europe. Net sales totaled $1.55 billion in
fiscal 2004 compared to $1.30 billion in 2003, and operating profits grew to $119 million, up 31 percent from the prior year’s
$91 million total.

Unallocated corporate items decreased from $76 million in fiscal 2003 to $17
million in fiscal 2004, primarily driven by a $36 million decrease in merger-related costs as the integration of Pillsbury
was completed during the year.

Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings increased from $61 million in
fiscal 2003 to $74 million in fiscal 2004, primarily due to unit volume gains.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

It is our view that changes in the general rate of inflation have not had
a significant effect on profitability over the three most recent years other than as noted above related to commodities. We
attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices. Our risk management practices
are discussed in the “Market Risk Management” section below.

CASH FLOWS

Sources and uses of cash in the past three years are shown in the following
table. Over the most recent three-year period, General Mills’ operations have generated $4.8 billion in cash. In fiscal
2005, cash flow from operations totaled over $1.7 billion. That was up from the previous year due primarily to the change in
current assets and liabilities included in cash flows from operations providing $258 million cash in 2005 versus using $186
million cash in 2004. The fiscal 2005 source of cash was due primarily to an increase in accrued taxes as the result of receiving
cash benefits from the utilization of capital losses for tax purposes. The fiscal 2004 use of cash was primarily due to lower
accrued liabilities, payments against integration and restructuring liabilities, and changes in accrued taxes.

In fiscal 2005, capital investment for land, buildings, equipment and intangibles
decreased to $434 million from $653 million in fiscal 2004. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $450 million in
fiscal 2006.

Dividends in 2005 totaled $1.24 per share, a payout of 40 percent of
diluted earnings per share, or 48 percent of diluted earnings per share excluding the net gain from divestitures and debt repurchases.
Our board of directors announced a 6 percent dividend increase to an annual rate of $1.32 per share, effective with the dividend
payable on August 1, 2005.

The decrease in outstanding debt in fiscal 2005 includes the results of debt
repurchases. On March 23, 2005, we commenced a cash tender offer for our outstanding 6% Notes due in 2012. The tender offer
resulted in the purchase of $500 million principal amount


of the Notes. Subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer, we purchased an additional $260 million
principal amount of the Notes in the open market. The aggregate purchases resulted in the debt repurchase costs described earlier
in the “Results of Operations – 2005 vs. 2004” section.

In May 2002, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Mills sold 150,000 Class A
preferred membership interests in General Mills Cereals LLC (GMC) to an unrelated third-party investor in exchange for $150
million. On October 8, 2004, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Mills sold 835,000 Series B-1 preferred membership interests
in GMC in exchange for $835 million. Currently, all interests in GMC, other than the aforementioned interests, but including
all managing member interests, are held by wholly owned subsidiaries of General Mills. We used $750 million of the proceeds
from the sale of GMC Series B-1 interests to purchase approximately 17 million shares of our common stock from Diageo plc at
$45.20 per share in October 2004. This share repurchase was made in conjunction with Diageo’s sale of approximately 33
million additional shares of General Mills common stock in an underwritten public offering. Following these transactions, Diageo
and its affiliates held approximately 29 million shares of General Mills common stock.

Concurrently in October 2004, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. issued $750 million
of notes, which are mandatorily exchangeable for General Mills common stock. In connection with the issuance of those notes,
an affiliate of Lehman Brothers entered into a forward purchase contract with General Mills, under which we are obligated to
deliver to such affiliate between approximately 14 million and 17 million shares of General Mills common stock, subject to
adjustment under certain circumstances. These shares will generally be deliverable by us in October 2007, in exchange for $750
million in cash or, in certain circumstances, securities of an affiliate of Lehman Brothers. We recorded a $43 million fee
for this forward purchase contract as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity.

With respect to the holders of minority interests in GMC, the Series B-1 interests
will be exchanged for shares of our perpetual preferred stock upon the occurrence of certain events, including a decrease in
our long-term debt rating below either Ba3 as rated by Moody’s or BB- as rated by Standard & Poor’s or Fitch,
Inc., or a failure to pay a quarterly dividend on our common stock. In addition, if GMC fails to make certain required distributions,
we will be restricted from paying any dividend (other than dividends in the form of shares of common stock) or other distributions
on shares of our common stock, and may not repurchase or redeem shares of our common stock, until such distributions are paid.
The Class A interests have the right to request the dissolution and liquidation of GMC upon the occurrence of certain events,
including the bankruptcy of GMC or its subsidiaries, failure to deliver the preferred distributions, failure to comply with
portfolio requirements, breaches of certain covenants, lowering of our senior debt rating below either Baa3 by Moody’s
or BBB by Standard & Poor’s, and a failed attempt to remarket the Class A interests as a result of a breach of
GMC’s obligations to assist in such remarketing. In the event of a liquidation of GMC, each member of GMC would receive
the amount of its then capital account balance. The managing member may avoid liquidation in most circumstances by exercising
an option to purchase the Class A interests. An election to purchase the preferred membership interests could impact our
liquidity by requiring us to refinance the purchase price.

Our board of directors has authorized the repurchase from time to time of
shares of our common stock subject to a maximum of 170 million shares held in our treasury. We did not repurchase a significant
number of our shares on the open market in fiscal 2005. With the completion of our $2 billion debt reduction plan in fiscal
2005, we intend to resume open-market share repurchases in fiscal 2006.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Our total debt was $6.2 billion as of May 29, 2005, a decrease of
$2.0 billion from May 30, 2004. We also consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part
of our debt structure, and include them in our measurement of “adjusted debt plus certain minority interests,” as
shown in the table below. In fiscal 2005, our adjusted debt plus certain minority interests declined by $1.7 billion,
to $6.7 billion, and our stockholders’ equity grew to $5.7 billion. The market value of our stockholders’ equity
increased as well, as an increase in share price was partially offset by a decrease in shares outstanding. As of May 29,
2005, our equity market capitalization was $18.3 billion, based on a price of $49.68 per share and 369 million basic shares


outstanding. Our total market capitalization, including adjusted debt, minority interests and equity
capital, was $25.8 billion as of May 29, 2005, down slightly from the total as of May 30, 2004.


Includes zero coupon convertible debentures due in 2022 as the result of put provisions exercisable in October
2005.


The Class A interests in GMC and Series A interests in General Mills Capital, Inc. (GM Capital) are included
in adjusted debt plus certain minority interests, whereas the Series B-1 interests of GMC are excluded since they are exchangeable
for equity in certain circumstances.

At the end of fiscal 2005, approximately 68 percent of our adjusted debt plus
certain minority interests was long-term. This includes classifying the zero coupon convertible debentures as short-term due
to put provisions exercisable in October 2005.

We consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as
part of our fixed-rate obligations. The following table, when reviewed in conjunction with the capital structure table, shows
the composition of our debt structure including the impact of using derivative instruments.

Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We can issue

borrowings are supported by $1.85 billion in committed credit lines. Currently, we have no outstanding borrowings under these
credit lines. The following table details the fee-paid credit lines we had available as of May 29, 2005.

On June 23, 2004, we filed a Universal Shelf Registration Statement (the
Shelf) with the SEC covering the sale of up to $5.9 billion of debt securities, common stock, preference stock, depository
shares, securities warrants, purchase contracts, purchase units and units (all described in the Shelf). In addition, the Shelf
covered the resale of approximately 50 million shares of our common stock owned by an affiliate of Diageo plc, which was completed
in October 2004 as described in the “Cash Flows” section above. The SEC declared the Shelf effective on September 20,
2004. As of May 29, 2005,


approximately $5.1 billion remained available under the Shelf for future use.

We believe that two important measures of financial strength are the ratios
of fixed charge coverage and cash flows from operations to adjusted debt plus certain minority interests. Our fixed charge
coverage in fiscal 2005 was 4.7 times compared to 3.8 times in fiscal 2004, and cash flows from operations to adjusted debt
plus certain minority interests increased to 26 percent. We expect to pay down between $100 and $200 million of adjusted debt
plus certain minority interests in fiscal 2006. Our goal is to return to a mid single-A rating for our long-term debt, and
to the top tier short-term rating, that we held prior to our announcement of the Pillsbury acquisition. Currently, Standard
and Poor’s Corporation has ratings of BBB+ on our publicly held long-term debt and A-2 on our commercial paper. Moody’s
Investors Services, Inc. has ratings of Baa2 for our long-term debt and P-2 for our commercial paper. Fitch Ratings, Inc. rates
our long-term debt BBB+ and our commercial paper F-2. Dominion Bond Rating Service in Canada currently rates General Mills
as A-low.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

It is not our general business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements
nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to third parties. We have, however, issued guarantees of approximately $168 million
for the debt and other obligations of unconsolidated affiliates, primarily CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements
are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases, which totaled approximately $462 million
at May 29, 2005.

The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing
contractual obligations, including payments due by period. The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for
projected raw material and packaging needs to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer-directed marketing
commitments that support our brands. The fair value of our interest rate swaps was $221 million at May 29, 2005, based on interest
rates as of that date. Future changes in interest rates will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle
those liabilities in the future. Other long-term obligations primarily consist of income taxes, accrued compensation and benefits,
miscellaneous liabilities and minority interests. We are unable to estimate the timing of the payments for these items. We
do not have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our defined-benefit retirement and other postretirement
benefit plans. Further information on these plans, including our expected contributions for fiscal 2006, is set forth in Note
Fourteen to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 47 through 51 in Item Eight of this report.

as the result of put provisions exercisable in October 2005.

If holders of the zero coupon convertible debentures exercise their rights
to require us to repurchase the notes in October 2005, we intend to refinance that obligation using sources of financing discussed
previously.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please
see Note One to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 31 through 34 in Item Eight of this report. Our
critical accounting policies are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results,
and that may require significant management judgment and estimates. These policies include our accounting for trade and consumer
promotion activities; asset impairments; income taxes; and pension and postretirement liabilities.

Trade and Consumer Promotion Activities

We report sales net of certain coupon and trade promotion costs. The trade
promotion costs include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store
displays, discounts


to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices, and payments to gain distribution of new products.

The amount and timing of expense recognition for trade and consumer promotion
activities involve management judgment related to estimated participation and performance levels. The vast majority of year-end
liabilities associated with these activities are resolved within the following fiscal year and therefore do not require highly
uncertain long-term estimates. For interim reporting, we estimate the annual trade promotion expense and recognize pro rata
period expense generally in proportion to revenue, adjusted for estimated year-to-date expenditures if greater than the pro
rata amount. Certain trade and consumer promotion expenses are recorded as reductions of net sales.

Promotional funds for our retail businesses are initially established at the
beginning of each year, and paid out over the course of the year based on the customer’s performance of agreed-upon merchandising
activity. During the year, additional funds may also be used in response to competitive activities, as a result of changes
in the mix of our marketing support, or to help achieve interim unit volume targets.

We set annual sales objectives and interim targets as a regular practice to
manage our business. Our sales employees are salaried, and are eligible for annual cash incentives based on performance against
objectives including goals for unit volume and the trade promotion cost per unit required to achieve the unit volume goal.
Our sales employees have discretion to plan and adjust the timing of merchandising activity over the course of the year, and
they also have some discretion to adjust the level of trade promotion funding applied to a particular event.

Our unit volume in the last week of each quarter is consistently higher than
the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter. In comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks
of a quarter, the final week of each quarter has approximately two to four days’ worth of incremental shipments (based
on a five-day week), reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter. This increased activity includes
promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal
demand early in the next quarter, as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets. This increased
sales activity results in shipments that are in direct response to orders from customers or authorized pursuant to prearranged
inventory-management agreements, and accordingly are recognized as revenue within that quarter. The two to four day range of
increased unit volume in the last week of each quarter has been generally consistent from quarter to quarter over the last
three years, except that in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we were slightly below the two to four day range, primarily as
actions to raise promoted prices on Big G cereals resulted in declines in promoted volume. If incremental shipments had been
within the two to four day range, our reported U.S. Retail volume growth for the quarter would have remained unchanged.

As part of our effort to assess the results of our promotional activities,
we regularly estimate the amount of “retailer inventory” in the system — defined as product that we have shipped
to our customers that has not yet been purchased from our customers by the end-consumer. While it is not possible for us to
measure the absolute level of inventory, we are able to estimate the change that occurs each month by comparing our shipments
to retail customers with their sales to end-consumers as reported by ACNielsen. Our estimate indicates inventory levels peak
in November when retailers have increased inventories to meet seasonal demand for products like refrigerated dough and
ready-to-serve soup. This seasonal trend is generally consistent from year to year, even as retailers have taken actions to
reduce their ongoing inventory levels.

We also assess the effectiveness of our promotional activities by evaluating
the end-consumer purchases of our products subsequent to the reporting period. If, due to quarter-end promotions or other reasons,
our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than end-consumer demand will require in future periods, then our
sales level in future reporting periods would be adversely affected.

As part of our ongoing evaluation of sales, we also monitor customer returns.
We generally do not allow a right of return on our products. However, on a limited case-by-case basis with prior approval,
we may allow customers to return products in saleable condition for redistribution to other customers or outlets. These returns
are recorded as reductions of net sales in the period of the return. Monthly returns are consistently below 1 percent of sales,
and have averaged approximately 0.5 percent of total monthly shipments over the last three years.


Asset Impairments

We are required to evaluate our long-lived assets, including goodwill, for
impairment and write down the value of any assets when they are determined to be impaired. Evaluating the impairment of long-lived
assets involves management judgment in estimating the fair values and future cash flows related to these assets. Although the
predictability of long-term cash flows may be uncertain, our evaluations indicate fair values for our long-lived assets and
goodwill that are significantly in excess of stated book values. Therefore, we believe the risk of unrecognized impairment
is low.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution
of any tax issues. Historically, our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been reasonably accurate. The
current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items, except for the accounting for losses
recorded as part of the Pillsbury transaction. The finalization of the tax benefits related to these losses would be accounted
for as a reduction of goodwill.

Pension Accounting

The accounting for pension and other postretirement liabilities requires the
estimation of several critical factors. Key assumptions that determine this liability and related income or expense include
the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets.

Our discount rate assumption is determined annually based on the interest
rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that match the expected benefit obligations. The
discount rate used to determine the pension and other postretirement obligations as of the balance sheet date is the rate
in effect as of that measurement date. That same discount rate also is used to determine pension and other postretirement expense
for the following fiscal year.

Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation,
our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from
our actuaries, investment services and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. Our historical investment
performance compound annual growth rates are 18%, 7%, 11%, 11%, 12% and 13% for the 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 year periods ended
May 29, 2005.

In addition to our assumptions about the discount rate and the expected rate
of return on plan assets, we base our determination of pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of assets which
reduces year-to-year volatility in accordance with SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.” This market-related
valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains
or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets
and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains
or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded.
As of May 29, 2005, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of approximately $993 million on our pension plans
and $393 million on our postretirement plans, primarily as the result of decreases in our discount rate assumptions. These
unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense
since they currently exceed the corridors defined by SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.”

In fiscal 2005, we recorded net pension and postretirement expense of $6 million
compared to $5 million in fiscal 2004. The discount rates used in our pension and other postretirement assumptions were 6.0
percent for the obligation as of May 25, 2003 and for our fiscal 2004 income and expense, and 6.65 percent for the obligation
as of May 30, 2004 and for our fiscal 2005 income and expense. For fiscal 2004 and 2005, we assumed a rate of return of
9.6 percent on our pension plan assets and our other postretirement plan assets.

For our fiscal 2006 pension and other postretirement income and expense estimate,
we have reduced the discount rate to 5.55 percent for our pension liabilities and 5.50 percent for our postretirement liabilities,
based on interest rates as of May 29, 2005. The expected rate of return on plan assets remains 9.6 percent. Actual future
net pension and postretirement income or expense will depend on investment performance,


changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating
in our pension and postretirement plans.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 50 basis
points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2006 by approximately $18 million. Lowering
the discount rate by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2006 by approximately
$24 million.

NEW ACCOUNTING RULES

The FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” in December
2004, which will require the cost of employee compensation paid with equity instruments to be measured based on grant-date fair
values and recognized over the vesting period. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced the adoption of a
new rule that amends the compliance dates for SFAS No. 123(R). The new rule allows companies to implement SFAS No. 123(R) at the
beginning of their fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005. Under the new rule, SFAS No. 123(R) will become effective for
us in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We are still evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 123(R) on our consolidated financial
statements.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs –
An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” SFAS No. 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). SFAS No. 151 is effective for the fiscal year beginning after June 15,
2005, and is effective for us in fiscal 2007. We do not expect SFAS No. 151 to have a material impact on our results of operations
or financial condition.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets – An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.” SFAS No. 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for
nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial
substance. SFAS No. 153 is effective for the first fiscal period beginning after June 15, 2005, and is effective for us
in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. We do not expect SFAS No. 153 to have a material impact on our results of operations
or financial condition.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 109-2, “Accounting
and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,”
(FSP No. 109-2). FSP No. 109-2 provides guidance with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions
of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act) on income tax expense and deferred tax liability. FSP No. 109-2 includes
a one year reduced tax rate on repatriation of foreign earnings and a phased-in tax deduction provided for qualifying domestic
production activities. We are currently evaluating the impact of repatriation provisions as Treasury guidance is provided.
However, the range of reasonably possible amounts of unremitted earnings that is being considered for repatriation in fiscal
year 2006 is between $0 and $60 million with the respective income tax impact ranging from $0 to $3 million based on a 5.25
percent tax rate.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations," (FIN 47). FIN 47 requires that liabilities be recognized for the fair value of a
legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably
estimated. We will adopt FIN 47 at the end of fiscal 2006 and do not expect it to have a material impact on our results of
operations or financial condition.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates, foreign
exchange rates and commodity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the
normal course of business, we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions,
authorized under company policies that place clear controls on these activities. The counterparties in these transactions are
highly rated institutions. Our hedging transactions include (but are not limited to) the use of a variety of derivative financial
instruments.

Interest Rates

We manage our debt structure and our interest rate risk
through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt and derivatives. We use interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest
rate changes, and also to reduce volatility of our financing costs. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty
to exchange


the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal
amount. Our primary exposure is to U.S. interest rates. As of May 29, 2005, we had $7.0 billion of aggregate notional
principal amounts (the principal amount on which the fixed or floating interest rate is calculated) outstanding, including
amounts that neutralize exposure through offsetting swaps. See Note Seven to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing
on pages 38 through 40 in Item Eight of this report.

Foreign Currency Rates

Foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net
investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts and option
contracts to selectively hedge our cash flow exposure to changes in exchange rates. These contracts function as hedges, since
they change in value inversely to the change created in the underlying exposure as foreign exchange rates fluctuate. Our primary
exchange rate exposures are with the Canadian dollar, the euro, the Australian dollar, the Mexican peso and the British pound
against the U.S. dollar.

Commodities

Certain commodities used in the production and distribution
of our products are exposed to market price risks. We manage this market risk through an integrated set of financial instruments,
including purchase orders, noncancelable contracts, futures contracts, futures options and swaps. Our primary commodity price
exposures are to grains, vegetables, dairy products, sugar, vegetable oils, meats, fruits, other agricultural products, packaging
materials and energy costs.

Value at Risk

These estimates are intended to measure the maximum potential
fair value General Mills could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity
prices, under normal market conditions. A Monte Carlo (VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures.
The models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level.

The VAR calculation used historical interest rates, foreign exchange rates
and commodity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future.
The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics

TM

data set. The calculations are not intended to represent actual
losses in fair value that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with
the underlying exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset
by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures. The positions included in the calculations were:
debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; and commodity swaps, futures and options. The calculations
do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities-related positions that are hedged by these market-risk-sensitive
instruments.

The table below presents the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair
value for our interest rate, foreign currency and commodity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding on May 29, 2005.
The amounts were calculated using the VAR methodology described above.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of General Mills, Inc. is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange
Act. The Company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management
and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Under the supervision
and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 29, 2005. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment using the criteria set forth by COSO in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 29, 2005.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
audit report on management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 29, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). General Mills’ management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company


are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that General Mills maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 29, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, General Mills maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 29, 2005, based on criteria established
in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May
29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive
income, and cash flows, for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended May 29, 2005, and our report dated July
28, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES

The management of General Mills, Inc. is responsible for the fairness and
accuracy of the consolidated financial statements. The statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
that are generally accepted in the United States, using management’s best estimates and judgments where appropriate. The
financial information throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with our consolidated financial statements.

Management has established a system of internal controls that provides reasonable
assurance that assets are adequately safeguarded and transactions are recorded accurately in all material respects, in accordance
with management’s authorization. We maintain a strong audit program that independently evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness
of internal controls. Our internal controls provide for appropriate separation of duties and responsibilities, and there are
documented policies regarding use of our assets and proper financial reporting. These formally stated and regularly communicated
policies demand highly ethical conduct from all employees.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets regularly with management,
internal auditors and our independent auditors to review internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters. The independent
auditors, internal auditors and employees have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time.

The Audit Committee reviewed and approved the Company’s annual financial
statements and recommended to the full Board of Directors that they be included in the Annual Report. The Audit Committee also
recommended to the Board of Directors that the independent auditors be reappointed for fiscal 2006, subject to ratification
by the stockholders at the annual meeting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

General Mills, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Mills,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’
equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended May 29, 2005.
In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements we also have audited the accompanying financial statement
schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 29, 2005 and
May 30, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year
period ended May 29, 2005 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
accompanying financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of General Mills’ internal control over financial reporting
as of May 29, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated July 28, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion on management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from our estimates.

(A) Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements
include parent company operations and majority-owned subsidiaries as well as our investment in and share of net earnings or
losses of 20- to 50-percent-owned companies, which are recorded on an equity basis. At May 29, 2005, we had invested in
one variable interest entity; however, we are not its primary beneficiary and therefore do not consolidate it.

Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in May. Fiscal years 2005 and 2003
each consisted of 52 weeks and fiscal 2004 consisted of 53 weeks. Our wholly owned international operations, with the exception
of Canada and our export operations, are reported for the 12 calendar months ended April 30.

(B) Land, Buildings, Equipment and Depreciation

Buildings and equipment
are recorded at historical cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary
maintenance and repairs are charged to operating costs. Buildings are usually depreciated over 40 to 50 years, and equipment
is depreciated over three to 15 years. Accelerated depreciation methods generally are used for income tax purposes. When an
item is sold or retired, the accounts are relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciation; the resulting gains and
losses, if any, are recognized.

(C) Inventories

Inventories except grain are valued at the lower
of cost or market. As discussed in Note Seven, grain inventories are valued at market. We generally use the LIFO method of
valuing inventory because we believe that it is a better match with current revenues. However, FIFO is used for most foreign
operations, where LIFO is not recognized for statutory purposes.

(D) Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the difference between
the purchase prices of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired and accounted for by the purchase
method of accounting. We capitalize the costs of software internally developed or externally purchased for internal use. The
costs of patents, copyrights and other amortizable intangible assets are amortized evenly over their estimated useful lives,
generally three to 10 years.

(E) Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets

We review long-lived assets,
including identifiable intangibles and goodwill, for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We use undiscounted cash flows when assessing our property and
equipment for recoverability. We use discounted cash flow models for our annual goodwill and identifiable intangible impairment
analysis. An asset is deemed impaired and is written down to its fair value if estimated related future cash flows are less
than its carrying amount.

(F) Foreign Currency Translation

For most of our foreign operations,
local currencies are considered the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates in effect
at the balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated using the average exchange rates during the period. Translation
effects are classified within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Stockholders’ Equity.

(G)  Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivatives primarily
to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. All derivatives are recognized
on the balance sheet at fair value based on quoted market prices and are recorded in either current or noncurrent assets or
liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded in earnings or other comprehensive
income, based on whether the instrument is designated as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. Gains
or losses on derivative instruments reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged
item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, any associated amounts reported in other comprehensive
income are reclassified to earnings at that time. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings in the current period. See
Note Seven for additional information related to our derivatives.


(H) Revenue Recognition

We recognize sales
upon shipment to our customers. Reported sales are net of certain coupon, trade promotion and other costs. Coupons are expensed
when distributed based on estimated redemptions. Trade promotions are expensed based on estimated participation and performance
levels for offered programs. We generally do not allow a right of return. However, on a limited case-by-case basis with prior
approval, we may allow customers to return product in saleable condition for redistribution to other customers or outlets.
These returns are recorded as reductions of net sales in the period of the return.

(I) Shipping and Handling

Shipping costs associated with the distribution
of finished product to our customers are recorded as selling, general and administrative expense and are recognized when the
related finished product is shipped to the customer.

(J)  Research and Development

All expenditures for research and development
are charged against earnings in the year incurred.

(K) Advertising Production Costs

We expense the production costs
of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.

(L) Stock-Based Compensation

We use the intrinsic value method for
measuring the cost of compensation paid in our common stock. This method defines our cost as the excess of the stock’s
market value at the time of the grant over the amount that the employee is required to pay. Our stock option plans require
that the employee’s payment (i.e., exercise price) be the market value as of the grant date.

The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net earnings and earnings
per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to stock-based employee compensation.

These amounts reflect the expensing of share awards made to retirement-eligible
employees over the expected vesting period of the award. SFAS 123(R), when adopted, will require the expensing of future awards
over the period to retirement eligibility, if less than the vesting period. See Note One (O). Future share-based compensation
amounts may differ from the pro forma amounts presented based on that change as well as any changes in the number of options
granted or their fair values.

The weighted average fair values at grant date of the options granted in fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003 were estimated as $8.32, $8.54 and $8.24, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with
the following weighted average assumptions:

The Black-Scholes model requires the input of certain key assumptions and
does not give effect to restrictions that are placed on employee stock options.

(M) Earnings per Share

Basic Earnings per Share (EPS) is computed
by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS includes the effect of all
dilutive potential common shares, primarily related to the effect of the contingent issuance of shares under our outstanding
zero coupon


convertible debentures and in-the-money stock options. See Note Twelve – Earnings Per Share.

(N) Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all investments purchased with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

(O) New Accounting Standards

Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2003,
we adopted SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The adoption of SFAS
No. 144 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees of Indebtedness
of Others.” FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosure requirements of guarantees, as well as requiring the recording of certain
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements (see Note Seventeen).

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities.” SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal
activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The adoption of this
Standard affected the timing of the recognition of exit or disposal costs for disposal activities initiated after December 31,
2002.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure about the effects on reported net income
of an entity’s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee compensation, as reflected in Note One
(L) to the consolidated financial statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer
classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 was
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise was effective at the beginning
of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. SFAS No. 150 was implemented in our second quarter of fiscal
2004 and did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities,” (FIN 46), as amended by FIN 46(R) in December 2003. FIN 46(R) requires that the primary
beneficiary of a variable interest entity consolidate the variable interest entity in its financial statements. FIN 46(R) was
implemented in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2003, the FASB revised SFAS No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.” The revision to SFAS No. 132 requires additional disclosures for pension
and other postretirement benefits plans, which are presented in Note Fourteen – Retirement and Other Postretirement
Benefit Plans.

The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Act)
was signed into law on December 8, 2003. The Act introduced a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit
plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare. FASB Staff Position 106-2
(FSP 106-2) provides accounting guidance related to the Act. We adopted FSP 106-2 at the beginning of our fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004 and it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. See Note Fourteen – Retirement
and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.

The FASB ratified in October 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.
04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share,” (EITF 04-8). EITF 04-8 was effective
for us in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. See Note Twelve – Earnings per Share for discussion and impact on diluted
shares and diluted earnings per share.

The FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” in December
2004, which will require the cost of employee compensation paid with equity instruments to be measured based on grant-date
fair values and recognized over the vesting period. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced the adoption
of a new rule that amends the compliance dates for SFAS No. 123(R). The new rule allows companies to implement SFAS No. 123(R)
at the beginning of their fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005. Under the new rule, SFAS No. 123(R) will become
effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. An illustration of the


impact on the Company using a Black-Scholes methodology is presented in the “Stock-based Compensation
Expense for Stock Options” section of Note One (L). We have not yet determined whether we will use Black-Scholes in our
final adoption of SFAS 123(R).

In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 109-2, “Accounting
and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,”
(FSP No. 109-2). FSP No. 109-2 provides guidance with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions
of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act) on income tax expense and deferred tax liability. FSP No. 109-2 includes
a one-year reduced tax rate on repatriation of foreign earnings and a phased-in tax deduction provided for qualifying domestic
production activities. See Note Sixteen – Income Taxes.

2. Divestitures

On February 28, 2005, Snack Ventures Europe, our snacks joint venture
with PepsiCo, Inc., was terminated and our 40.5 percent interest was redeemed. On April 4, 2005, we sold our Lloyd’s
barbecue business to Hormel Foods Corporation. We received $799 million in cash proceeds from these dispositions and recorded
$499 million in gains in fiscal 2005.

3. Restructuring and Other Exit Costs

In fiscal 2005, we recorded restructuring and other exit costs of $84 million
pursuant to approved plans, consisting of: $74 million of charges associated with fiscal 2005 supply chain initiatives; $3
million of charges associated with Bakeries and Foodservice severance charges resulting from fiscal 2004 decisions; and $7
million of charges associated with restructuring actions prior to fiscal 2005. The charges from the fiscal 2005 initiatives
included severance and pension and postretirement curtailment costs of $14 million for 551 employees being terminated, $20
million to write off assets, $30 million for the write-down of assets to their net realizable value, and $10 million of other
exit costs. The carrying value of the assets written down was $36 million. Net realizable value was determined by independent
market analysis.

The fiscal 2005 initiatives were undertaken to further increase asset utilization
and reduce manufacturing and sourcing costs, resulting in decisions regarding plant closures and production realignment. The
actions included decisions to: close our flour milling plant in Vallejo, California, affecting 43 employees; close our par-baked
bread plant in Medley, Florida, affecting 42 employees; relocate bread production from our Swedesboro, New Jersey plant, affecting
110 employees; relocate a portion of our cereal production from Cincinnati, Ohio, affecting 45 employees; close our snacks
foods plant in Iowa City, Iowa, affecting 83 employees; close our dry mix production at Trenton, Ontario, affecting 53 employees;
and relocate our frozen baked goods line from our plant in Chelsea, Massachusetts to another facility, affecting 175 jobs.

These fiscal 2005 supply chain actions are also resulting in certain associated
expenses, primarily resulting from adjustments to the depreciable life of the assets necessary to reflect the shortened asset
lives which now coincide with the final production dates at the Cincinnati and Iowa City plants. These associated expenses
are being recorded as cost of sales. The fiscal 2005 expense recorded in cost of sales was $18 million.

In fiscal 2004, we recorded restructuring and other exit costs of $26 million
pursuant to approved plans. These costs included: a severance charge for 142 employees being terminated as a result of a plant
closure in the Netherlands; costs related to a plant closure in Brazil including a severance charge for 201 employees; costs
for the closure of our tomato canning facility in Atwater, California, including severance costs for 47 employees; adjustments
of costs associated with previously announced closures of manufacturing facilities; and a severance charge for 132 employees,
related primarily to actions in our Bakeries and Foodservice organization. The carrying value of the assets written down was
$3 million.

In fiscal 2003, we recorded restructuring and other exit costs totaling $62
million pursuant to approved plans. These costs consisted of charges associated with the closure of our St. Charles, Illinois
plant, expenses relating to exiting production at former Pillsbury facilities being closed, and flour mill, grain and other
restructuring/closing charges. These fiscal 2003 costs include severance related to 264 St. Charles plant employees and the
write-down of $31 million of production assets, primarily the St. Charles facility. The carrying value of the assets written
down was $36 million. At May 29, 2005, we had disposed of all of these assets.


The analysis of our restructuring and other exit costs activity is as follows:


4. Investments in Joint Ventures

We have a 50 percent equity interest in Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), a
joint venture with Nestlé that manufactures and markets ready-to-eat cereals outside the United States and Canada. We
have guaranteed 50 percent of CPW’s debt. See Note Seventeen – Leases and Other Commitments. We have a 50 percent
equity interest in 8th Continent, LLC, a domestic joint venture with DuPont to develop and market soy foods and beverages.
We have 50 percent interests in the following joint ventures for the manufacture, distribution and marketing of

Häagen-Dazs

frozen ice cream products and novelties: Häagen-Dazs Japan K.K., Häagen-Dazs Korea Company Limited, Häagen-Dazs
Distributors (Thailand) Company Limited, and Häagen-Dazs Marketing & Distribution (Philippines) Inc. We also have
a 50 percent interest in Seretram, a joint venture with Co-op de Pau for the production of

Green Giant

canned corn in
France.

On February 28, 2005, our 40.5 percent ownership interest in the Snack
Ventures Europe (SVE) joint venture was redeemed for $750 million. The redemption ended the European snack joint venture between
General Mills and PepsiCo, Inc. See Note Two – Divestitures.

The joint ventures are reflected in our consolidated financial statements
on the equity basis of accounting. We record our share of the earnings or losses of these joint ventures. We also receive
royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily research and development) and record the tax
impact of certain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships.

Our cumulative investment in these joint ventures (including our share of
earnings and losses) was $223 million, $434 million and $372 million at the end of fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. We made aggregate investments in the joint ventures of $15 million, $31 million and $17 million in
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We received aggregate dividends from the joint ventures of $83 million, $60 million
and $95 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Summary combined financial information for the joint ventures on a 100 percent
basis follows. Since we record our share of CPW results on a two-month lag, CPW information is included as of and for
the 12 months ended March 31. The Häagen-Dazs and Seretram joint ventures are reported as of and for the 12 months
ended April 30. The 8th Continent information is consistent with our May year-end. The SVE information is consistent with
our May year-end for fiscal 2003 and 2004, and SVE operating results for fiscal 2005 are included up through the termination
date of the joint venture.

5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The components of goodwill and other intangible assets are as follows:

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal 2003, 2004 and
2005 are as follows:

The Pillsbury acquisition valuation and purchase price allocation was recorded
in fiscal 2002 and 2003. The activity during fiscal 2003 primarily reflects the allocation of the purchase price
to brand intangibles, net of tax, and the contingent value rights payment to Diageo related to the Pillsbury acquisition. Future
purchase price adjustments to goodwill may occur upon the resolution of certain income tax accounting matters. See Note Sixteen
– Income Taxes.

Intangible asset amortization expense was $28 million, $23 million and
$18 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Estimated amortization expense for the next five fiscal years (in
millions) is as follows: $27 in 2006, $22 in 2007, $17 in 2008, $14 in 2009 and $14 in 2010.

At May 29, 2005, and May 30, 2004, respectively, inventories of
$758 million and $765 million were valued at LIFO. Results of operations were not materially affected by a liquidation of LIFO
inventory. The difference between replacement cost and the stated LIFO inventory value is not materially different from
the reserve for LIFO valuation method.

7. Financial Instruments and Risk Management Activities

Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents,
receivables, accounts payable and notes payable approximate fair value. Marketable securities are carried at fair value. As
of May 29, 2005, a comparison of cost and market values of our marketable securities (which are debt and equity securities)
was as follows:

Earnings include realized gains from sales of available-for-sale marketable
securities of $2 million, $20 million and $14 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Gains and losses are
determined by specific identification. The aggregate unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of tax
effects, are classified in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income within Stockholders’ Equity. At May 29, 2005, we
owned one marketable security with a fair market value less than cost. The fair market value of this security was less than
$0.1 million below its cost.

Scheduled maturities of our marketable securities are as follows:

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $63 million and
$142 million were pledged as collateral as of May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, respectively. These assets are primarily
pledged as collateral for certain derivative contracts.

The fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $6,074
million and $7,926 million at May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, respectively. The fair value of long-term debt is estimated
using discounted cash flows based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments.

Risk Management Activities

As a part of our ongoing business operations,
we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. To
manage these risks, we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and swaps) pursuant to established
company policies.

Interest Rate Risk –

We are exposed to interest rate volatility
with regard to existing variable-rate debt and planned future issuances of fixed-rate debt. We use interest rate swaps, including
forward-starting swaps, to reduce interest rate volatility and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed-rate
debt, based on current and projected market conditions.

Variable Interest Rate Exposures – Except as discussed below, variable-to-fixed
interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with effectiveness assessed based on either the hypothetical derivative
method or changes in the present value of interest


payments on the underlying debt. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003.

When we issue fixed-rate debt, any corresponding forward-starting interest
rate swaps are dedesignated as hedges and the amount related to those swaps within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income is
reclassified into earnings over the life of the associated fixed-rate debt.

Fixed Interest Rate Exposures – Fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps
are accounted for as fair value hedges with effectiveness assessed based on changes in the fair value of the underlying debt,
using incremental borrowing rates currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities. Effective gains and losses
on these derivatives and the underlying hedged items are recorded as interest expense.

In anticipation of the Pillsbury acquisition and other financing needs, we
entered into pay fixed interest rate swap contracts during fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002 totaling $7.1 billion to lock in
our interest payments on the associated debt. During fiscal 2004, $750 million of these swaps matured. In fiscal 2005, $2 billion
of these swaps matured. At May 29, 2005, we still owned $3.15 billion of Pillsbury-related pay fixed swaps that were previously
neutralized with offsetting pay floating swaps in fiscal 2002. At May 29, 2005, $500 million of our pay floating interest
rate swaps were designated as a fair value hedge of our 2.625% notes due October 2006.

The following table summarizes the notional amounts and weighted average interest
rates of our interest rate swaps. As discussed above, we have neutralized all of our pay fixed swaps with pay floating swaps;
however, we cannot present them on a net basis in the following table because the offsetting occurred with different counterparties.
Average variable rates are based on rates as of the end of the reporting period.

Foreign Exchange Transaction Risk –

We are exposed to fluctuations
in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to third-party purchases, intercompany product shipments, and intercompany
loans. Forward contracts of generally less than 12 months duration are used to hedge some of these risks. Hedge effectiveness
is assessed based on changes in forward rates. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was $1 million or less in fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003.

Commodity Price Risk –

We are exposed to price fluctuations primarily
as a result of anticipated purchases of ingredient and packaging materials. We use a combination of long cash positions with
suppliers, exchange-traded futures and option contracts and over-the-counter hedging mechanisms to reduce price fluctuations
in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases over a period of generally less than one year. Except as discussed below, commodity
derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with effectiveness assessed based on changes in futures prices. The amount
of hedge ineffectiveness was $1 million or less in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003. Losses of $2 million were reclassified into
earnings as a result of the discontinuance of commodity cash flow hedges in fiscal 2003.


Other Risk Management Activities –

We
enter into certain derivative contracts in accordance with our risk management strategy that do not meet the criteria for hedge
accounting, including our grain merchandising operation, certain foreign currency derivatives, and offsetting interest rate
swaps as discussed above. Even though they may not qualify as hedges, these derivatives have the economic impact of largely
mitigating the associated risks. These derivatives were not acquired for trading purposes and are recorded at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period.

We use a grain merchandising operation to provide us efficient access to and
more informed knowledge of various commodities markets. This operation uses futures and options to hedge its net inventory
position to minimize market exposure. As of May 29, 2005, our grain merchandising operation had futures and options contracts
that essentially hedged its net inventory position. None of the contracts extended beyond May 2006. All futures contracts and
futures options are exchange-based instruments with ready liquidity and determinable market values. Neither results of operations
nor the year-end positions of our grain merchandising operation were material to our overall results.

Unrealized losses from cash flow hedges recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income as of May 29, 2005, totaled $122 million, primarily related to interest rate swaps we entered into in contemplation
of future borrowings and other financing requirements (primarily related to the Pillsbury acquisition), which are being reclassified
into interest expense over the life of the interest rate hedge as long as there continue to be interest payments on the associated
debt. The estimated net amount of the existing gains and losses in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as of May 29,
2005, that is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is $36 million in expense. See Note Eight
– Debt for the impact of these reclassifications on interest expense.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

We enter into interest rate, foreign exchange,
and certain commodity derivatives with a diversified group of highly rated counterparties. We continually monitor our positions
and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one party.
These transactions may expose us to potential losses due to the credit risk of nonperformance by these counterparties; however,
we have not incurred a material loss nor are losses anticipated. We also enter into commodity futures transactions through
various regulated exchanges.

8. Debt

Notes Payable

The components of notes payable and their respective weighted
average interest rates at the end of the periods were as follows:

To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient
to cover our outstanding short-term borrowings. As of May 29, 2005, we had $1.85 billion in committed lines and $301
million in uncommitted lines. Our committed lines consist of a $750 million credit facility expiring in January 2009 and a
$1.1 billion facility expiring in January 2006. These revolving credit agreements provide us with the ability to refinance
short-term borrowings on a long-term basis; accordingly, a portion of our notes payable had been reclassified to long-term
debt as of May 30, 2004.

Long-Term Debt

On March 23, 2005, we commenced a cash tender offer
for our outstanding 6% Notes due in 2012. The tender offer resulted in the purchase of $500 million principal amount of the
Notes. Subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer, we purchased an additional $260 million principal amount of the Notes
in the open market. The aggregate purchases resulted in debt repurchase costs of $137 million consisting of $73 million of
noncash interest rate swap losses reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, $59 million of purchase premium
and $5 million of noncash unamortized cost of issuance expense.


On September 24, 2003, we sold $500 million of 2


/


%
fixed-rate notes due October 24, 2006. Interest on these notes is payable semiannually on April 24 and October 24,
beginning April 24, 2004. Concurrently, we entered into an interest rate swap for $500 million notional amount where we
receive 2


/


% fixed interest and pay LIBOR plus 11 basis points.

On August 11, 2003, we entered into a $75 million five-year term (callable
after two years) bank borrowing agreement. The floating rate coupon is one month LIBOR plus 15 basis points and interest is
payable on a monthly basis.

On November 20, 2002, we sold $350 million of 3


/


%
fixed-rate notes and $135 million of 3.901% fixed-rate notes due November 30, 2007. Interest for these notes is payable
semiannually on May 30 and November 30, beginning May 30, 2003.

On October 28, 2002, we completed a private placement of zero coupon
convertible debentures with a face value of approximately $2.23 billion for gross proceeds of approximately $1.50 billion.
The issue price of the debentures was $671.65 for each $1,000 in face value, which represents a yield to maturity of 2.00%.
The debentures cannot be called by us for three years after issuance and will mature in 20 years. Holders of the debentures
can require us to repurchase the notes on the third, fifth, tenth and fifteenth anniversaries of the issuance. We have the
option to pay the repurchase price in cash or in stock. The notes are classified as current portion of long-term debt as the
result of the associated put provisions. The debentures are convertible into our common stock at a rate of 13.0259 shares for
each $1,000 debenture. This results in an initial conversion price of approximately $51.56 per share and represents a
premium of 25 percent over the closing sale price of $41.25 per share on October 22, 2002. The conversion price will increase
with the accretion of the original issue discount on the debentures. Generally, except upon the occurrence of specified events,
holders of the debentures are not entitled to exercise their conversion rights until our stock price is greater than a specified
percentage (beginning at 125 percent and declining by 0.25 percent each six months) of the accreted conversion price per share.
At May 29, 2005, the conversion price was $54.29. The shares issuable upon conversion are included in diluted earnings
per share. See Note Twelve – Earnings Per Share.

As of May 29, 2005, the amount recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income associated with our interest rate swaps ($119 million) will be reclassified to interest expense over the remaining lives
of the hedged forecasted transaction, which mirrors the remaining life of swap contracts (ranging from one to eight years).
The amount reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in fiscal 2005 was $161 million, of which $88 million was
recorded as interest expense and $73 million was recorded as part of the debt repurchase costs described above. The amount
expected to be reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income to interest expense in fiscal 2006 is $34 million.

A summary of our long-term debt is as follows:


The zero coupon convertible debentures are included in the current portion of long-term debt as the result of
put provisions described above.

See Note Seven – Financial Instruments and Risk Management Activities
for a description of related interest-rate derivative instruments.

We have guaranteed the debt of the Employee Stock Ownership Plan; therefore,
the loan is reflected on our


consolidated balance sheets as long-term debt with a related offset in Unearned Compensation in Stockholders’
Equity.

The sinking fund and principal payments due on long-term debt based on stated
contractual maturities are (in millions) $59, $2,037, $486, $172 and $15 in fiscal 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
The fiscal 2006 amount is exclusive of $1 million of interest yet to be accreted on zero coupon notes.

9. Minority Interests

In April 2002, the Company and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries contributed
assets with an aggregate fair market value of approximately $4 billion to another wholly owned subsidiary, General Mills Cereals,
LLC (GMC), a limited liability company. GMC is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Company and its subsidiaries,
and has separate assets, liabilities, businesses and operations. The contributed assets consist primarily of manufacturing
assets and intellectual property associated with the production and retail sale of Big G ready-to-eat cereals,

Progresso

soups and

Old El Paso

products. In exchange for the contribution of these assets, GMC issued the managing membership
interest and preferred membership interests to wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The managing member directs the business
activities and operations of GMC and has fiduciary responsibilities to GMC and its members. Other than rights to vote on certain
matters, holders of the preferred membership interests have no right to direct the management of GMC.

In May 2002, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company sold 150,000 Class A
preferred membership interests in GMC to an unrelated third-party investor in exchange for $150 million. On October 8,
2004, another wholly owned subsidiary of the Company sold 835,000 Series B-1 preferred membership interests in GMC in exchange
for $835 million. In connection with the sale of the Series B-1 interests, GMC and its existing members entered into a Third
Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of GMC (the LLC Agreement), setting forth, among other things, the
terms of the Series B-1 and Class A interests held by the third-party investors and the rights of those investors. Currently,
all interests in GMC, other than the 835,000 Series B-1 interests and 150,000 Class A interests, but including all managing
member interests, are held by wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.

The Class A interests receive quarterly preferred distributions at a
floating rate equal to (i) the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 90 basis points, divided by (ii) 0.965. The LLC Agreement requires
that the rate of the distributions on the Class A interests be adjusted by agreement between the third-party investor
holding the Class A interests and GMC every five years, beginning in June 2007. If GMC and the investor fail to mutually
agree on a new rate of preferred distributions, GMC must remarket the Class A interests to set a new distribution rate.
Upon a failed remarketing, the rate over LIBOR will be increased by 75 basis points until the next scheduled remarketing date.
GMC, through its managing member, may elect to repurchase all of the Class A interests at any time for an amount equal
to the holder’s capital account, plus any applicable make-whole amount. Under certain circumstances, GMC also may be required
to be dissolved and liquidated, including, without limitation, the bankruptcy of GMC or its subsidiaries, failure to deliver
the preferred distributions, failure to comply with portfolio requirements, breaches of certain covenants, lowering of our
senior debt rating below either Baa3 by Moody’s or BBB by Standard & Poor’s, and a failed attempt to remarket
the Class A interests as a result of a breach of GMC’s obligations to assist in such remarketing. In the event of
a liquidation of GMC, each member of GMC would receive the amount of its then capital account balance. The managing member
may avoid liquidation in most circumstances by exercising an option to purchase the Class A interests. An election to
purchase the preferred membership interests could impact our liquidity by requiring us to refinance the purchase price.

The Series B-1 interests are entitled to receive quarterly preferred distributions
at a fixed rate of 4.5% per year, which is scheduled to be reset to a new fixed rate through a remarketing in October 2007.
Beginning in October 2007, the managing member of GMC may elect to repurchase the Series B-1 interests for an amount equal
to the holder’s then current capital account balance plus any applicable make-whole amount. GMC is not required to purchase
the Series B-1 interests.

Upon the occurrence of certain exchange events (as described below), the Series
B-1 interests will be exchanged for shares of perpetual preferred stock of the Company. An exchange will occur upon the senior


unsecured debt rating of the Company falling below either Ba3 as rated by Moody’s Investors Service,
Inc. or BB- as rated by Standard & Poor’s or Fitch, Inc., a bankruptcy or liquidation of the Company, a default on
any senior indebtedness of the Company resulting in an acceleration of indebtedness having an outstanding principal balance
in excess of $50 million, the Company failing to pay a dividend on its common stock in any fiscal quarter, or certain liquidating
events as set forth in the LLC Agreement.

If GMC fails to make a required distribution to the holders of Series B-1
interests when due, we will be restricted from paying any dividend (other than dividends in the form of shares of common stock)
or other distributions on shares of our common or preferred stock, and may not repurchase or redeem shares of our common or
preferred stock, until all such accrued and undistributed distributions are paid to the holders of the Series B-1 interests.
If the required distributions on the Series B-1 interests remain undistributed for six quarterly distribution periods, the
managing member will form a nine-member board of directors to manage GMC. Under these circumstances, the holder of the Series
B-1 interests will have the right to appoint one director. Upon the payment of the required distributions, the GMC board of
directors will be dissolved. At May 29, 2005, we have made all required distributions to the Series B-1 interests. As
discussed above, upon the occurrence of certain events the Series B-1 interests will be included in our computation of diluted
earnings per share as a participating security.

For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations,
and cash flows of GMC are included in our consolidated financial statements. The third-party investors’ Class A and
Series B-1 interests in GMC are reflected as minority interests on our consolidated balance sheet, and the return to the third
party investors is reflected as interest, including minority interest, expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.

In fiscal 2003, General Mills Capital, Inc. (GM Capital), a wholly owned subsidiary,
sold $150 million of its Series A preferred stock to an unrelated third-party investor. GM Capital regularly purchases our
receivables. These receivables are included in the consolidated balance sheet and the $150 million purchase price for the Series
A preferred stock is reflected as minority interest on the balance sheet. The proceeds from the issuance of the preferred stock
were used to reduce short-term debt. The return to the third-party investor is reflected as interest, including minority interest,
expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.

10. Stockholders’ Equity

Cumulative preference stock of 5 million shares, without par value, is authorized
but unissued.

We have a shareholder rights plan that entitles each outstanding share of
common stock to one right. Each right entitles the holder to purchase one two-hundredths of a share of cumulative preference
stock (or, in certain circumstances, common stock or other securities), exercisable upon the occurrence of certain events.
The rights are not transferable apart from the common stock until a person or group has acquired 20 percent or more, or makes
a tender offer for 20 percent or more, of the common stock. Then each right will entitle the holder (other than the acquirer)
to receive, upon exercise, common stock of either the Company or the acquiring company having a market value equal to two times
the exercise price of the right. The initial exercise price is $120 per right. The rights are redeemable by the Board of Directors
at any time prior to the acquisition of 20 percent or more of the outstanding common stock. The shareholder rights plan was
specifically amended so that the Pillsbury acquisition in fiscal 2002 did not trigger the exercisability of the rights. The
rights expire on February 1, 2006. At May 29, 2005, there were 369 million rights issued and outstanding.

The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase, from time to time,
of common stock for our treasury, provided that the number of treasury shares shall not exceed 170 million.

In October 2004, we purchased approximately 17 million shares of our common
stock from Diageo plc for $750 million, or $45.20 per share. This share repurchase was made in conjunction with Diageo’s
sale of approximately 33 million additional shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering. Following these
transactions, Diageo and its affiliates held approximately 29 million shares of our common stock.

Concurrently in October 2004, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. issued $750 million
of notes, which are mandatorily exchangeable for shares of our common


stock. In connection with the issuance of those notes, an affiliate of Lehman Brothers entered into
a forward purchase contract with us, under which we are obligated to deliver to such affiliate between approximately 14 million
and 17 million shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. These shares will generally be
deliverable by us in October 2007, in exchange for $750 million in cash or, in certain circumstances, securities of an affiliate
of Lehman Brothers. We recorded a $43 million fee for this forward purchase contract as an adjustment to stockholders’
equity.

Through private transactions in fiscal 2003 as part of our stock repurchase
program, we issued put options for less than 1 million shares for $1 million in premiums paid to us. As of May 29,
2005 and May 30, 2004, no put options remained outstanding. On October 31, 2002, we purchased call options from Diageo
plc on approximately 29 million shares that Diageo currently owns. The premiums paid for the call options totaled $89 million.
The options are exercisable in whole or in part from time to time, subject to certain limitations, during a three-year period
from the date of the purchase of the calls. As of May 29, 2005, these call options for 29 million shares remained outstanding
at an exercise price of $51.56 per share with a final exercise date of October 28, 2005.

11. Stock Plans

We use broad-based stock plans to help ensure alignment with stockholders’
interests. The 2003 Stock Compensation Plan (2003 Plan) was approved by shareholders in September 2003, increased the use of
restricted stock and reduced our reliance on stock options as the principal form of long-term compensation. A total of 3,221,872
shares are available for grant under the 2003 Plan through December 31, 2005 and the 2001 Director Plan through September 30,
2006. Shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units may also be granted under the Executive Incentive Plan through
September 25, 2010. Shares available for grant are reduced by shares issued, net of shares surrendered to us in stock-for-stock
exercises. Options may be priced only at 100 percent of the fair market value at the date of grant. No options now outstanding
have been re-priced since the original date of grant. Options now outstanding include some granted under the 1990, 1993, 1995,
1998 senior management and 1998 employee option plans, under which no further rights may be granted. All options expire within
10 years and one month after the date of grant. The stock plans provide for full vesting of options upon completion of
specified service periods or in the event of a change of control.

Stock subject to a restricted period and a purchase price, if any (as determined
by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors), may be granted to key employees under the 2003 Plan. Restricted stock
units, up to 50 percent of the value of an individual’s cash incentive award, may be granted through the Executive Incentive
Plan. Certain restricted stock unit awards require the employee to deposit personally owned shares (on a one-for-one basis)
with the Company during the restricted period. The 2001 Director Plan allows each nonemployee director to annually receive
1,000 restricted stock units convertible to common stock at a date of the director’s choosing following his or her one-year
term. In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, grants of 1,497,840, 1,738,581 and 345,889 shares of restricted stock or units were made
to employees and directors with weighted average values at grant of $46.73, $46.35 and $44.13 per share, respectively. On May 29,
2005, a total of 4,154,993 restricted shares and units were outstanding under all plans.

SFAS No. 123 allows either a fair value based method or an intrinsic value
based method of accounting for stock-based compensation plans. We use the intrinsic value based method. Stock-based compensation
expense related to restricted stock for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $38 million, $27 million and $21 million, respectively.
Stock-based compensation expense for stock options is not reflected in net earnings, as all options granted under those plans
had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant. See Note One (L) for
additional details.

12. Earnings Per Share

On October 13, 2004, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share,” (EITF 04-8). EITF 04-8 became
effective for us in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of EITF 04-8 increased diluted shares outstanding by 29
million shares to give effect to shares that are contingently issuable related to our zero coupon convertible debentures issued
in October 2002. Also, net earnings used for earnings per share calculations were adjusted, using the if-converted method.
The effect of EITF 04-8 reduced previously reported annual diluted earnings per share by $0.15 and $0.08 for fiscal 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) were calculated using the following:

(a)

Computed as the weighted average of net shares outstanding on stock-exchange trading days.

(b)

Incremental shares from stock options, restricted stock and stock rights are computed by the “treasury
stock” method.

(c)

Shares from contingently convertible debentures are reflected using the “if-converted” method.

When we issued the zero coupon convertible debentures, we simultaneously purchased
call options to purchase 29 million shares from Diageo to directly offset the shares that are contingently issuable under the
debentures as discussed in Note Ten. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the offsetting effect of these call options
cannot be considered when determining the dilutive effect of the contingently issuable shares.


We can call these debentures as early as October 2005, and we have the option
to pay the repurchase price in cash or in stock. Accordingly, the dilutive effect on EPS also could be affected by our ability
to repurchase the debentures in fiscal 2006.

The diluted EPS calculation does not include 9 million, 12 million and
13 million average anti-dilutive stock options in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, nor does it include 3 million average
anti-dilutive put options in fiscal 2003. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, the forward contract with Lehman
Brothers will be included in our calculation of diluted earnings per share. See Note Ten.

14. Retirement and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

Defined-Benefit Plans

We have defined-benefit retirement plans covering most employees. Benefits
for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. The hourly plans include various monthly
amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of federal law. Our principal
retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would vest in plan participants
if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control.

We sponsor plans that provide health-care benefits to the majority of our
retirees. The salaried health-care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We fund
related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization
Act of 2003 (Act) was signed into law on December 8, 2003. FASB Staff Position 106-2 (FSP 106-2) provides accounting guidance
related to the Act. We adopted FSP 106-2 effective as of the Act’s enactment date, December 8, 2003. The reduction
in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the Act subsidy related to past services was $54 million. The effect
of the subsidy on postretirement cost for fiscal 2004 was a reduction of approximately $3 million.

We use our fiscal year-end as a measurement date for substantially all of
our pension and postretirement benefit plans.


Obligations and Funded Status —

Reconciliation of the funded status of these plans and the
amounts included in the balance sheet are as follows:

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined-benefit plans was $2,868 million and $2,415 million
at May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, respectively.

Assumed trend rates for health-care costs have an important effect on the
amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans. If the health-care cost trend rate increased by 1 percentage point in
each future year, the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of postretirement expense would increase for fiscal
2005 by $6 million, and the postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 29, 2005, would increase by $87 million.
If the health-care cost trend rate decreased by 1 percentage point in each future year, the aggregate of the service and interest
cost components of postretirement expense would decrease for fiscal 2005 by $6 million, and the postretirement accumulated
benefit obligation as of May 29, 2005, would decrease by $77 million.

Plan Assets —

Our weighted-average asset allocations for the past two fiscal years for our
pension plans and our postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

The investment objective for the U.S. pension and postretirement medical plans
is to secure the benefit


obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. The goal is to optimize the long-term return
on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The pension and postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset
classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations.
For the pension and postretirement plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 35 percent to U.S. equities, 15 percent
to international equities, 10 percent to private equities, 30 percent to fixed income and 10 percent to real assets
(real estate, energy and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term
policy allocations based on relative market valuations.

Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation,
our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from
our actuaries, investment services and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions.

Contributions and Future Benefit Payments —

We expect to contribute $5 million to our pension
plans and $21 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2006. Estimated benefit payments, which reflect
expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

Certain international operations have defined-benefit pension plans that are
not presented in the tables above. These international operations have prepaid pension assets of less than $1 million at the
end of fiscal 2005 and 2004, and they have accrued pension plan liabilities of $7 million at the end of fiscal 2005 and $5
million as of the end of fiscal 2004. Pension expense associated with these plans was $6 million, $3 million and $3 million
for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Defined-Contribution Plans

Our total expense related to defined-contribution plans recognized in fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003 was $17 million, $20 million and $30 million, respectively. The General Mills Savings Plan is a defined
contribution plan that covers salaried and nonunion employees. It had net assets of $1,797 million as of May 29,
2005, and $1,668 million as of May 30, 2004. This plan is a 401(k) savings plan that includes a number of investment
funds and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). The ESOP’s only assets are our common stock and temporary cash balances.
The ESOP’s share of the total defined contribution expense was $11 million, $15 million and $26 million in fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The ESOP’s expense is calculated by the “shares allocated” method.

The ESOP uses our common stock to convey benefits to employees and, through
increased stock ownership, to further align employee interests with those of shareholders. We match a percentage of employee
contributions to the ESOP with a base match plus a variable year-end match that depends on annual results. Employees receive
our match in the form of common stock.

The ESOP originally purchased our common stock principally with funds borrowed
from third parties (and guaranteed by us). The ESOP shares are included in net shares outstanding for the purposes of calculating
earnings per share. The ESOP’s third-party debt is described in Note Eight.

We treat cash dividends paid to the ESOP the same as other dividends. Dividends
received on leveraged shares (i.e., all shares originally purchased with the debt proceeds) are used for debt service, while
dividends received on unleveraged shares are passed through to participants.

Our cash contribution to the ESOP is calculated so as to pay off enough debt
to release sufficient shares to make our match. The ESOP uses our cash contributions to the plan, plus the dividends received
on the ESOP’s leveraged shares, to make principal and interest payments on the ESOP’s debt. As loan payments are
made, shares become unencumbered by debt and are committed to be allocated. The ESOP allocates shares to individual employee
accounts on the basis of the match of employee payroll savings (contributions), plus reinvested dividends received on previously
allocated shares. In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the ESOP incurred interest


expense of $1 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively. The ESOP used dividends of $4
million, $5 million and $6 million in the respective years, along with our contributions of less than $1 million in fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003 to make interest and principal payments.

The number of shares of our common stock in the ESOP is summarized as follows:

15. Profit-Sharing Plan

The Executive Incentive Plan provides incentives to key employees who have
the greatest potential to contribute to current earnings and successful future operations. All employees at the level of vice
president and above participate in the plan. These awards are approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors,
which consists solely of independent, outside directors. Awards are based on performance against pre-established goals approved
by the Committee. Profit-sharing expense was $17 million, $16 million and $19 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

16. Income Taxes

The components of Earnings Before Income Taxes and Earnings from Joint Ventures
and the corresponding income taxes thereon are as follows:

In fiscal 2005 and 2004, we paid income taxes of $227 million and $225 million,
respectively. In fiscal 2003, we paid income taxes of $248 million and received a $109 million refund of fiscal 2002 tax overpayments.

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets
and liabilities are as follows:

Of the total valuation allowance, $780 million relates to a deferred tax asset
for losses recorded as part of the Pillsbury acquisition. In the future, when tax benefits related to these losses are finalized,
the reduction in the valuation allowance will be allocated to reduce goodwill. The other $75 million of the valuation allowance
primarily relates to certain state and foreign operating losses. In the future, if tax benefits are realized related to these
losses, the reduction in the valuation allowance will reduce tax expense. At May 29, 2005, we believe it is more likely than
not that the remainder of our deferred tax asset is realizable.

We have not recognized a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of
$771 million from our foreign operations because we do not expect those earnings to become taxable to us in the foreseeable
future and because a determination of the potential liability is not practicable. If a portion were to be remitted, we believe
income tax credits would substantially offset any resulting tax liability.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 109-2, “Accounting
and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,”
(FSP No. 109-2). FSP No. 109-2 provides guidance with respect to recording the impact of the repatriation provisions of the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act). The Jobs Act includes a one-year reduced tax rate on repatriation of foreign
earnings and a phased-in tax deduction provided for qualifying domestic production activities. We are currently evaluating
the impact of repatriation provisions as Treasury guidance is provided. However, the range of reasonably possible amounts of
unremitted earnings that is being considered for repatriation in fiscal year 2006 is between $0 and $60 million with the respective
income tax impact ranging from $0 to $3 million based on a 5.25 percent tax rate.

Some leases require payment of property taxes, insurance and maintenance costs
in addition to the rent payments. Contingent and escalation rent in excess of minimum rent payments and sublease income netted
in rent expense were insignificant.

Noncancelable future lease commitments (in millions) are: $92 in fiscal 2006,
$78 in fiscal 2007, $72 in fiscal 2008, $59 in fiscal 2009, $49 in fiscal 2010 and $112 after fiscal 2010, with a cumulative
total of $462. These future lease commitments will be partially offset by expected future sublease receipts of $52 million.

We are contingently liable under guarantees and comfort letters for $168 million.
The guarantees and comfort letters are principally issued to support borrowing arrangements, primarily for our joint ventures.

We are involved in various claims, including environmental matters, arising
in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters, either individually
or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.


18. Business Segment and Geographic Information

We operate exclusively in the consumer foods industry, with multiple operating
segments organized generally by product categories.

We aggregate our operating segments into three reportable segments: 1) U.S.
Retail; 2) Bakeries and Foodservice; and 3) International. Our U.S. Retail segment accounted for approximately 69 percent
of our fiscal 2005 net sales, and reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores; specialty stores; drug, dollar and
discount chains; and mass merchandisers operating throughout the United States. Our major product categories in this business
segment are ready-to-eat cereals, meals, refrigerated and frozen dough products, baking products, snacks, yogurt and organic
foods. Our Bakeries and Foodservice segment generated approximately 16 percent of fiscal 2005 net sales. This business segment
consists of products marketed to retail and wholesale bakeries, commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators,
and convenience stores throughout the United States and Canada. The remaining 15 percent of our fiscal 2005 net sales was generated
by our consolidated International businesses. These include a retail business in Canada that largely mirrors our U.S. retail
product mix, along with retail and foodservice businesses competing in key markets in Europe, Latin America and the Asia/Pacific
region. At the beginning of fiscal 2005, certain products were realigned from Big G Cereals to Snacks within the U.S. Retail
segment. All prior year amounts are restated for comparative purposes.

During fiscal 2005, one customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately
16 percent of our consolidated net sales and 22 percent of our sales in the U.S. Retail segment. No other customer accounted
for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. The top five customers in our U.S. Retail segment accounted for
approximately 45 percent of its fiscal 2005 net sales, and the top five customers in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment accounted
for approximately 34 percent of its fiscal 2005 net sales.

Management reviews operating results to evaluate segment performance. Operating
profit for the reportable segments excludes unallocated corporate items (including foreign currency transaction losses of $6 million,
$2 million and less than $1 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively); interest, including minority interest,
expense; restructuring and other exit costs; gain on divestitures; debt repurchase costs; income taxes; and earnings from joint
ventures as they are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed
by management. Under our supply chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse and distribution activities are substantially
integrated across our operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed assets, capital expenditures
for long-lived assets, and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained nor available by operating segment.

The measurement of operating segment results is generally consistent with
the presentation of the consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany transactions between reportable operating segments
were not material in the periods presented.

categories:
