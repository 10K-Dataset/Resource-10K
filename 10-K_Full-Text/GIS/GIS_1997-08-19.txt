                                     PART I

Item 1.  Business

     General Mills,  Inc. was  incorporated  in Delaware in 1928. The Company is
engaged in the manufacture  and marketing of consumer foods products.  The terms
"General  Mills,"  "Company" and "Registrant"  mean General Mills,  Inc. and its
subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.

     Recent Developments.
     On January 31, 1997, the Company purchased the branded  ready-to-eat cereal
and snack mix  businesses  of Ralcorp  Holdings,  Inc.,  including  its CHEX and
COOKIE CRISP brands, for a total price of $570 million, payable in General Mills
common  stock and  through  the  assumption  of Ralcorp  debt.  The  transaction
included a Cincinnati, Ohio manufacturing facility, and trademark and technology
rights for the branded  products in the Americas.  See Note Two to  Consolidated
Financial Statements appearing on page 23 of the Company's 1997 Annual Report to
Stockholders, incorporated herein by reference.

     General Business.
     The Company is a leading  producer of packaged  consumer  foods and markets
its  products  primarily  through  its own  sales  organizations,  supported  by
advertising  and other  promotional  activities.  Such  products  are  primarily
distributed directly to retail food chains, cooperatives,  membership stores and
wholesalers.  Certain  food  products,  such  as  yogurt  and  some  foodservice
products, are sold through distributors and brokers.

     The packaged  consumer  foods market is highly  competitive,  with numerous
competitors  of varying  sizes.  The principal  methods of  competition  include
product quality, advertising, promotion and price. In most of its consumer foods
lines,  described  below,  General  Mills  competes  not only with other  widely
advertised  branded  products,  but also with generic products and private label
products, which are generally distributed at lower prices.

    CEREALS.  General Mills produces and sells a number of ready-to-eat cereals,
including such brands as: CHEERIOS, HONEY NUT CHEERIOS,  FROSTED CHEERIOS, APPLE
CINNAMON  CHEERIOS,  MULTI-GRAIN  CHEERIOS,  WHEATIES,  HONEY FROSTED  WHEATIES,
CRISPY WHEATIES 'N RAISINS,  LUCKY CHARMS, CORN TOTAL, WHEAT TOTAL, TOTAL RAISIN
BRAN,  TRIX,  GOLDEN  GRAHAMS,  KIX, BERRY BERRY KIX, FIBER ONE,  REESE'S PEANUT
BUTTER PUFFS,  COCOA PUFFS,  CINNAMON TOAST CRUNCH,  CLUSTERS,  RAISIN NUT BRAN,
OATMEAL CRISP,  TRIPLES and BASIC 4. In fiscal 1997, the Company introduced TEAM
CHEERIOS,  FRENCH TOAST CRUNCH and BETTY  CROCKER  cereals and acquired the CHEX
and COOKIE CRISP cereal brands from Ralcorp Holdings, Inc.

     DESSERTS, FLOUR AND BAKING MIXES. General Mills makes and sells a line of
dessert  mixes under the BETTY CROCKER  trademark,  including  SUPERMOIST  layer
cakes, RICH & CREAMY and SOFT WHIPPED ready-to-spread frostings, SUPREME brownie
mixes,  SUPREME  dessert  bars,  muffin mixes,  and SWEET  REWARDS  fat-free and
reduced-fat  dessert mixes.  The Company  markets variety baking mixes under the
BISQUICK trademark, sells pouch mixes under the BETTY CROCKER name, and produces
family flour under the GOLD MEDAl brand, introduced in 1880, and regional brands
such as LA PINA,  ROBIN HOOD and RED BAND.  The  Company  also  engages in grain
merchandising,  produces flour for internal  ingredient  requirements  and sells
flour to bakery, foodservice and manufacturing markets.

     DINNER AND SIDE DISH PRODUCTS.  General Mills  manufactures a line of BETTY
CROCKER dry packaged dinner mixes under the HAMBURGER HELPER,  TUNA HELPER,  and
SKILLET CHICKEN HELPER trademarks.  Also under the BETTY CROCKER trademark,  the
Company  sells dry  packaged  specialty  potatoes,  POTATO BUDS  instant  mashed
potatoes, SUDDENLY SALAD and BAC*O'S salad topping.

     SNACK  PRODUCTS AND BEVERAGES.  General Mills markets POP SECRET  microwave
popcorn; a line of grain snacks including NATURE VALLEY granola bars,  DUNKAROOS
and newly  introduced  GOLDEN GRAHAMS TREATS;  a line of fruit snacks  including
FRUIT ROLL-UPS,  FRUIT BY THE FOOT, GUSHERS,  FRUIT STRING THING, BUGS BUNNY AND
TRIX  SHAPES;  a line of  fat-free  snack bars under the name SWEET  REWARDS;  a
recently  acquired  salty snack product called CHEX SNACK MIX and a savory snack
marketed  under the name BUGLES.  The Company also  produces and sells a line of
single-serving  fruit juice drinks  marketed  under the SQUEEZIT  trademark  and
SQUEEZIT 100, a 100% juice beverage.

     YOGURT  PRODUCTS.  Yoplait  USA  manufactures  and sells a line of  yogurt,
including YOPLAIT ORIGINAL, YOPLAIT LIGHT, CUSTARD STYLE, TRIX, a layered yogurt
for  children and YOPLAIT  CRUNCHY  LIGHT,  a non-fat  yogurt with an overcap of
crunchy  toppings.  Yoplait USA also markets frozen yogurt and novelties under a
licensing  arrangement.  The Colombo yogurt  business  manufactures  and sells a
variety of refrigerated cup yogurt products under the COLOMBO brand name.

     FOODSERVICE. The Foodservice division markets General Mills branded baking
mixes, cereals, snacks,  refrigerated and soft frozen yogurt and custom products
to the commercial  and  non-commercial  sectors,  including  schools,  colleges,
hotels, restaurants and the healthcare industry.

     INTERNATIONAL FOODS OPERATIONS. The International Foods organization of the
Company  exports  packaged food products and snack pellets  throughout the world
and  licenses  food  products  for  manufacture  in Europe and the  Asia/Pacific
region.  General Mills Canada,  Inc.  manufactures  and sells BIG G ready-to-eat
cereals in Canada.  It also markets BETTY CROCKER  dessert,  baking and packaged
dinner mixes and snacks in Canada.

     The  Company  has  three  international  joint  ventures.  See Note Five to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  appearing on page 24 of the Company's  1997
Annual Report to Stockholders, incorporated herein by reference. Cereal Partners
Worldwide (CPW), the Company's joint venture with Nestle,  S.A., through various
entities,  competes in more than 60 countries and  republics,  including  recent
expansion into Central Europe and Brazil.  The following  products were marketed
under the umbrella Nestle  trademark in fiscal 1997: TRIO,  CLUSTERS,  NESQUICK,
MULTI-CHEERIOS,  HONEY NUT CHEERIOS, GOLDEN GRAHAMS, CINI MINIS, CHOCAPIC, TRIX,
ESTRELITAS, GOLD, KIX, MILO, FIBRE 1, KANGUS, SPORTIES, FITNESS, SHREDDED WHEAT,
SHREDDIES,  COUNTRY CORN FLAKES,  APPLE PUFFS,  HONEY STARS,  KOKO KRUNCH,  SNOW
FLAKES, ZUCOSOS and APPLE MINIS. CPW also manufactures private label cereals for
customers in the United Kingdom. The Company has a 50% equity interest in CPW.

     Snack  Ventures  Europe (SVE),  the  Company's  joint venture with PepsiCo,
Inc.,  manufactures and sells snack foods in Holland,  France,  Belgium,  Spain,
Portugal, Greece, Estonia, Hungary, Russia and Slovakia. The Company has a 40.5%
equity interest in SVE.

     International  Dessert  Partners L.L.C.  (IDP), the Company's joint venture
with CPC International  Inc., sells baking and dessert mixes in Brazil,  Mexico,
Colombia,  Argentina,  and recently expanded its operations into Chile, Peru and
Uruguay.  In fiscal 1997 IDP began  manufacturing  baking mixes in Uruguay.  The
Company has a 50% equity interest in IDP.

General
     TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS.  The Company's products are marketed and businesses
operated under trademarks and service marks owned by or licensed to the Company.
Trademarks  and  service  marks are vital to the  Company's  business.  The most
significant  trademarks  and service  marks of the Company are  contained in the
business segment discussions above.

     The Company  considers that, taken as a whole, the rights under its various
patents,  which expire from time to time, are a valuable asset,  but the Company
does not believe that its businesses  are  materially  dependent upon any single
patent or group of related patents.  Outside its joint venture  activities,  the
Company's  activities  under licenses or other franchises or concessions are not
material.

     RAW  MATERIALS AND  SUPPLIES.  The principal raw materials  used by General
Mills are cereal grains, sugar, fruits, other agricultural  products,  vegetable
oils, and plastic and paper for packaging materials.  Although General Mills has
some  long-term  contracts,  the majority of such raw materials are purchased on
the open market.  Prices of most raw materials  will probably  increase over the
long term. Nonetheless, General Mills believes that it will be able to obtain an
adequate supply of needed ingredients and packaging materials.  Occasionally and
where possible,  General Mills makes advance  purchases of items  significant to
its  business  in  order to  ensure  continuity  of  operations.  The  Company's
objective is to procure  materials  meeting both the Company's quality standards
and its production needs at the lowest total cost to the Company.  The Company's
strategy is to buy these  materials at price levels that allow a targeted profit
margin.  Since  commodities  generally  represent  the largest  variable cost in
manufacturing the Company's products, to the extent possible, the Company hedges
the risk associated  with adverse price movements of grains,  vegetable oils and
sugar using  exchange-traded  futures and  options and forward  cash  contracts.
These tools enable the Company to manage the related  commodity  price risk over
periods of time that exceed the period of time in which the  physical  commodity
is  available.  Accordingly,  the Company  uses  hedging to  mitigate  the risks
associated with adverse price movements and not to speculate in the marketplace.
See also Note Eight to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on page 25 of
the  Company's  1997  Annual  Report  to  Stockholders,  incorporated  herein by
reference.

     CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES.  During the three  fiscal  years ended May 25, 1997,
General Mills expended $448 million for capital expenditures,  not including the
cost of acquired  companies.  The Company  expects to spend  approximately  $190
million for such purposes in fiscal 1998.

     RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  The main research and development facilities are
located  at the James  Ford Bell  Technical  Center in Golden  Valley  (suburban
Minneapolis),  Minnesota.  With a staff of  approximately  780,  the  Center  is
responsible  for  most  of the  food  research  for the  Company.  Approximately
one-half  of  the  staff  hold  degrees  in  various  chemical,  biological  and
engineering    sciences.    Research   and   development    expenditures    (all
Company-sponsored)  amounted to $61.4  million in fiscal 1997,  $60.1 million in
fiscal  1996 and $59.8  million in fiscal  1995.  General  Mills'  research  and
development   resources  are  focused  on  new  product   development,   product
improvement, process design and improvement,  packaging and exploratory research
in new business areas.

     EMPLOYEES.  At  May  25,  1997,  General  Mills  had  approximately  10,200
employees.

     ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS.  As of June 30,  1997,  the  Company  has  received
notices  advising  it that there have been  releases or  threatened  releases of
hazardous  substances  or wastes at 12 sites,  and alleging  that the Company is
potentially  responsible for cleaning up those sites and/or paying certain costs
in  connection  with  those  sites.  These  matters  involve  several  different
procedural contexts,  including litigation initiated by governmental authorities
and/or  private  parties,  administrative  proceedings  commenced by  regulatory
agencies,  and demand  letters  issued by  regulatory  agencies  and/or  private
parties.  The Company recognizes that its potential exposure with respect to any
of these sites may be joint and  several,  but has  concluded  that its probable
aggregate  exposure is not material.  This conclusion is based upon, among other
things,  the Company's  payments  and/or accruals with respect to each site; the
number, ranking, and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties
identified  at each of the  sites;  the  status  of the  proceedings,  including
various settlement agreements,  consent decrees or court orders;  allocations of
volumetric waste contributions and allocations of relative  responsibility among
potentially  responsible parties developed by regulatory agencies and by private
parties;  remediation  cost estimates  prepared by  governmental  authorities or
private  technical  consultants;  and the  Company's  historical  experience  in
negotiating and settling disputes with respect to similar sites.

     Based on current  facts and  circumstances,  General  Mills  believes  that
neither the results of these  proceedings  nor its  compliance  in general  with
environmental  laws or regulations  will have a material adverse effect upon the
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.

     Segment Information.  Reporting financial  information relating to industry
segments  of  General  Mills  was  discontinued  as of May  28,  1995  with  the

Company's 1997 Annual Report to Stockholders,  incorporated herein by reference.

Cautionary Statement Relevant to Forward-Looking  Information for the Purpose of
"Safe Harbor" Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
     The Company and its  representatives  may from time to time make written or
oral forward-looking  statements with respect to long-term goals of the Company,
including  statements contained in the Company's filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and in its reports to stockholders.

     The words or  phrases  "will  likely  result,"  "are  expected  to,"  "will
continue,"  "is  anticipated,"  "estimate,"  "project"  or  similar  expressions
identify  "forward-looking   statements"  within  the  meaning  of  the  Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain
risks and  uncertainties  that could cause actual  results to differ  materially
from  historical  earnings and those  presently  anticipated  or projected.  The
Company  wishes to  caution  readers  not to place  undue  reliance  on any such
forward-looking statements,  which speak only as of the date made. In connection
with the "safe harbor"  provisions of the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform
Act of 1995,  the Company is hereby  identifying  important  factors  that could
affect the Company's financial  performance and could cause the Company's actual
results for future periods to differ  materially from any opinions or statements
expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements.

     Among the factors which have affected and may continue to affect  operating
results are the  following:  (i)  significant  price  competition by the largest
branded cereal manufacturers, including competitive promotional spending levels;
and (ii) high  ingredient  prices compared to historical  levels.  The Company's
operating  results may also be affected by other  external  factors such as: the
effect of economic  conditions;  the impact of competitive products and pricing;
product  development;  actions of  competitors  other than as  described  above;
changes in laws and  regulations,  including  changes in  accounting  standards;
customer  demand;   effectiveness  of  advertising  and  marketing  spending  or
programs; consumer perception of health-related issues; fluctuations in the cost
and availability of supply-chain  resources;  and foreign  economic  conditions,
including currency rate fluctuations.

     The Company  specifically  declines to undertake any obligation to publicly
revise any  forward-looking  statements that have been made to reflect events or
circumstances  after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of
anticipated or unanticipated events.

  For purposes of  computing  the ratio of earnings to fixed  charges,  earnings
represent  pretax income from  continuing  operations,  plus pretax  earnings or
losses of joint  ventures,  plus fixed  charges (net of  capitalized  interest).
Fixed charges represent interest (whether expensed or capitalized) and one-third
(the  proportion  deemed  representative  of the  interest  factor)  of rents of
continuing operations.
