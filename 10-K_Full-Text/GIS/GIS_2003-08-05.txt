Item 1. Business.

Company Overview

General Mills, Inc. was incorporated in
Delaware in 1928. The terms “General Mills,”
“Company” and “Registrant” mean General Mills,
Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates
otherwise.

General Mills is a leading producer of packaged
consumer foods and operates exclusively in the consumer foods industry.
The Company’s businesses are divided into three reportable
segments:

•

U.S.
Retail;

•

Bakeries and Foodservice;
and

•

International.

The
Company’s operating segments are organized generally by product
categories. U.S. Retail consists of cereals, meals, refrigerated and
frozen dough products, baking products, snacks, yogurt and organic
foods. The Bakeries and Foodservice segment consists of products
marketed to retail and wholesale bakeries and offered to the commercial
and noncommercial foodservice sectors throughout the United States and
Canada, such as restaurants and school cafeterias. The International
segment is made up of retail business outside the United States and
foodservice business outside of the United States and Canada. A more
detailed description of the product categories for each reportable
segment is set forth below.

On October 31, 2001, General
Mills completed the acquisition of the worldwide businesses of The
Pillsbury Company from Diageo plc (“Diageo”). With the
Pillsbury acquisition, the Company added established, market-leading
brands to its U.S. retail business, more than doubled its foodservice
business, significantly increased its international presence and
created opportunities for productivity improvement and cost synergies.
Since the completion of the acquisition, activities related to the
integration of Pillsbury and the Company have included combining
selling organizations, merging benefit plans and payroll systems,
migrating all U. S. businesses to single invoicing and supply chain
information systems and reconfiguring certain manufacturing facilities.
For a more detailed description of the Pillsbury acquisition, please
see Note Two to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on
pages 30 through 32 in Item Eight of this
report.

See Note
Four to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on page 34 in
Item Eight of this report.


Competition

The
consumer foods market is highly competitive, with numerous
manufacturers of varying sizes in the United States and throughout the
world. The Company’s principal strategies for competing in each
of its segments include superior product quality, innovative
advertising, product promotion, product innovations and price. In most
product categories, the Company competes not only with other widely
advertised branded products of major companies, but also with generic
products and private label products, which are generally sold at lower
prices. Internationally, the Company primarily competes with local
manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of
competitors.

Customers

During
fiscal 2003, one customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for
approximately 13 percent of the Company’s consolidated net sales
and 17 percent of the Company’s sales in the U.S. Retail segment.
No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the
Company’s consolidated net sales. In the U. S. Retail and
Bakeries and Foodservice segments, during fiscal 2003, the top five
customers accounted for approximately 43 percent and 35 percent of net
sales,
respectively.

Seasonality

In
general, demand for the Company’s products is evenly balanced
throughout the year. However, demand for the Company’s
refrigerated dough, frozen baked goods and baking products is stronger
in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand for

Progresso

soup
is higher during the fall and winter months. Internationally, demand
for

Häagen-Dazs

ice cream is higher during the summer
months and demand for the baking mix and dough products increases
during winter months. Due to the offsetting impact of these demand
trends, as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern
hemispheres, the Company’s international net sales are generally
evenly balanced throughout the
year.

General
Information

Trademarks
and Patents.

Trademarks and service marks are vital
to the Company’s businesses. The Company’s products are
marketed under trademarks and service marks that are owned by or
licensed to the Company. The most significant trademarks and service
marks used in the Company’s businesses are set forth in

italics

in the business discussions above. These marks
include the trademarks used in our international joint ventures that
are owned by or licensed to the joint ventures. In addition, some of
the Company’s products are marketed under or in combination with
trademarks that have been licensed from others, including

Yoplait

yogurt,

Reese’s Puffs

and

NesQuik

cereal brands,

Hershey’s

chocolate included with a variety of products, and a variety of
characters and brands used on fruit snacks, including Sunkist,
Pokémon, and various Disney, Warner Bros. and Sesame Workshop
characters.

As part of the sale to International
Multifoods Corporation (“IMC”) of certain Pillsbury dessert
and specialty product businesses, IMC received an exclusive
royalty-free license to use the

Doughboy

trademark and

Pillsbury

brand in the desserts and baking mix categories.
The licenses are renewable without cost in 20-year increments at
IMC’s discretion.

The Company considers the
collective rights under its various patents, which expire from time to
time, a valuable asset, but the Company does not believe that its
businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or group of
related patents.

Raw
Materials and Supplies.

The principal raw materials
used by General Mills are cereal grains, sugar, dairy products,
vegetables, fruits, meats, other agricultural products, vegetable oils,
plastic and paper packaging materials, operating supplies and energy.
The Company has some long-term fixed price contracts, but the majority
of such raw materials are purchased on the open market. The Company
believes that it will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed
ingredients and packaging materials. Occasionally and where possible,
the Company makes advance purchases of items significant to its
business in order to ensure continuity of operations. The
Company’s objective is to procure materials meeting both the
company’s quality standards and its production needs at the
lowest total cost to the Company. The Company’s strategy is to
buy these materials at price levels that allow a targeted profit
margin. Since commodities generally represent the largest variable cost
in manufacturing the Company’s products, to the extent possible,
the Company hedges the risk associated with adverse price movements
using exchange-traded


futures and options, forward cash contracts
and over-the-counter hedging mechanisms. These tools enable the Company
to manage the related commodity price risk over periods of time that
exceed the period of time in which the physical commodity is available.
Accordingly, the Company uses these hedging tools to mitigate the risks
associated with adverse price movements and not to speculate in the
marketplace. See also Note Seven to the Consolidated Financial
Statements appearing on pages 37 through 39 in Item Eight of this
report and the “Market Risk Management” section of
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operation appearing on pages 18 and 19 in Item Seven of this
report.

Capital
Expenditures.

During the fiscal year ended May 25,
2003, General Mills’ aggregate capital expenditures for fixed
assets and intangibles amounted to $750 million, including construction
costs to consolidate the Company’s headquarters and expenditures
associated with the acquisition and integration of Pillsbury. The
Company expects to spend approximately $650 million for capital
projects in fiscal 2004, primarily for fixed assets to support further
growth, increase supply chain productivity and complete the Pillsbury
integration.

Research
and Development.

Major research and development
facilities are located at the Riverside Technical Center in
Minneapolis, Minnesota and the James Ford Bell Technical Center in
Golden Valley (suburban Minneapolis), Minnesota. General Mills’
research and development resources are focused on new product
development, product improvement, process design and improvement,
packaging, and exploratory research in new business areas. Research and
development expenditures amounted to $149 million in fiscal 2003, $131
million in fiscal 2002, and $83 million in fiscal
2001.

Employees.

At
May 25, 2003, General Mills had approximately 27,300
employees.

Food
Quality and Safety Regulation.

The manufacture and
sale of consumer food products is highly regulated. In the United
States, the Company’s activities are subject to regulation by
various government agencies, including the Food and Drug
Administration, United States Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade
Commission and Department of Commerce, as well as various state and
local agencies. The Company’s business is also regulated by
similar agencies outside of the United
States.


Environmental
Matters.

As of June 2003, General Mills
was involved with the following active cleanup sites associated with
the alleged release or threatened release of hazardous substances or
wastes:

These
matters involve several different actions, including litigation
initiated by governmental authorities and/or private parties,
administrative proceedings commenced by regulatory agencies, and demand
letters issued by regulatory agencies and/or private parties. Of the 17
matters in the table above, the Company is a party to current
litigation related to two cleanup
sites:

•

Pennsauken
Solid Waste Management Authority, et al. v. State of New Jersey, et
al., Defendants — Quick-way, Inc., Defendant and Third-party
Plaintiff, v. A-1 Accoustical Ceiling, Inc. et al.

involves a
State of New Jersey superfund site where a former subsidiary of the
Company has been sued as a third-party defendant. The Company is
defending this action under the terms of an indemnification agreement.
The amount of the cleanup liability has not been
determined.

•

West
Coast Home Builders, Inc. v. Ashland Inc., et al.

involves a
claim for an unspecified amount of damages for the diminished value of
property adjacent to a State of California superfund site. The cleanup
of the site is covered by an existing settlement agreement between the
State of California and a group of the potentially responsible parties.
The Company has executed a Tolling Agreement with the Plaintiff and
expects the existing litigation to be dismissed. In addition, the
potentially responsible parties have an insurance policy that covers
the costs of cleanup in excess of amounts already paid, including third
party claims related to the site. We believe the claims are covered by
the insurance policy and that the Company does not have any financial
exposure as a result of this
litigation.

The Company recognizes that
its potential exposure with respect to any of these sites may be joint
and several, but has concluded that its probable aggregate exposure is
not material. This conclusion is based upon, among other things, the
Company’s payments and/or accruals with respect to each site; the
number, ranking, and financial strength of other potentially
responsible parties identified at each of the sites; the status of the
proceedings, including various settlement agreements, consent decrees
or court orders; allocations of volumetric waste contributions and
allocations of relative responsibility among potentially responsible
parties developed by regulatory agencies and by private parties;
remediation cost estimates prepared by governmental authorities or
private technical consultants; and the Company’s historical
experience in negotiating and settling disputes with respect to similar
sites.


The Company’s operations are
subject to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and
Rodenticide Act, and all similar state environmental laws applicable to
the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Based on current
facts and circumstances, the Company believes that neither the results
of its environmental proceedings nor its compliance in general with
environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect
upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the
Company.

Item
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operation

General
Mills is a global consumer foods company. We compete in markets around
the world by developing differentiated food products that consumers
recognize as superior to alternative offerings. We market our
value-added products under unique brand names, and build the equity of
those brands with strong consumer-directed advertising and innovative
merchandising. We believe this brand-building strategy is the key to
winning and sustaining market share leadership. We believe that our
business portfolio, expanded in fiscal 2002 with the acquisition of
Pillsbury, will generate superior financial returns for our
shareholders over the long term.

Our financial performance
is determined by how well we execute the key elements of our business
model. These key business drivers are: unit volume growth, which is the
single most critical element; productivity initiatives, to mitigate the
effects of cost inflation; efficient utilization of capital; and
prudent management of risk. This section of the Annual Report on Form
10-K discusses our critical accounting policies, the results of our
operations, our liquidity and financial condition, and our risk
management
practices.

Critical
Accounting Policies

For a complete description of our
significant accounting policies, please see Note One to the
consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are
those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial
condition and results, and that require significant management judgment
and estimates. These policies include our accounting for (a) trade and
consumer promotion activities; (b) asset impairments; (c) income taxes;
and (d) pension and postretirement liabilities.

The amount
and timing of expense recognition for trade and consumer promotion
activities involve management judgment related to estimated
participation and performance levels. The vast majority of year-end
liabilities associated with these activities are resolved within the
following fiscal year and therefore do not require highly uncertain
long-term estimates.

We are required to evaluate our
long-lived assets, including goodwill, for impairment and write down
the value of any assets when they are determined to be impaired.
Evaluating the impairment of long-lived assets involves management
judgment in estimating the fair values and future cash flows related to
these assets. Although the predictability of long-term cash flows may
be uncertain, our evaluations indicate fair values for our long-lived
assets and goodwill that are significantly in excess of stated book
values. Therefore, we believe the risk of unrecognized impairment is
low.

Income tax expense involves management judgment as to
the ultimate resolution of any tax issues. Historically, our
assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been
reasonably accurate. The current open tax issues are not dissimilar in
size or substance from historical items.

The accounting for
pension and other postretirement liabilities requires the estimation of
several critical factors. Because changes in these estimates can have a
significant impact, we have described them in more detail below in the
section titled “Pension
Accounting.”

Results
of Operations — 2003 vs. 2002

The acquisition
of Pillsbury, on October 31, 2001, significantly affected fiscal 2003
comparisons for our results of operations, as our fiscal 2002 results
include only seven months of ownership of the Pillsbury businesses. Net
earnings (including cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle, adopted in fiscal 2002, as described in more detail in the
section below titled “New Accounting Rules”) were $917
million, up 100 percent from fiscal 2002. Diluted earnings per share
were $2.43 compared to $1.34 in fiscal 2002. Annual net sales rose 32
percent, to $10.5 billion, driven by a 30 percent increase in worldwide
unit volume for fiscal 2003. The balance of the net sales growth was
primarily attributable to promotional efficiencies. On a comparable
basis, as if General Mills had owned Pillsbury for all of fiscal 2002,
worldwide unit volume grew 3 percent. This performance reflects
improvement in our U.S. Retail segment but was constrained by economic
factors limiting growth in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment and
Latin American operations in our International
segment.


The Pillsbury acquisition materially
altered our business structure. Our Bakeries and Foodservice segment
and International segment, which now represent larger portions of our
sales and earnings, have lower gross margins than General Mills'
historical margins. These businesses also are generally supported with
lower marketing spending as a percent of sales.

Cost of
goods sold as a percent of sales declined from 59 percent in fiscal
2002 to 58 percent in fiscal 2003. This reduction reflects the benefit
of synergies created from the Pillsbury acquisition. Increased
operating leverage, defined as increased absorption of fixed operating
cost as a result of higher volume levels, was offset by the incremental
five months of Pillsbury’s business structure versus fiscal 2002
as discussed in the previous paragraph.

Selling, general
and administrative costs include certain infrequently occurring items.
In fiscal 2003, we recorded $70 million of costs related to the
planning and execution of the integration of Pillsbury, including
consulting, system conversions, relocation, training and
communications, compared to $52 million of similar expenditures in
fiscal 2002. Selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of
sales were 24 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to 26 percent in 2002.
The above noted infrequently occurring items increased selling, general
and administrative costs as a percent of sales by 1 percent in both
fiscal 2002 and 2003. The two percentage point year-over-year decrease
in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales was
primarily generated by synergies.

Our fiscal 2003 results
included restructuring and other exit costs of $62 million as discussed
in more detail in Note Three to the consolidated financial statements.
These were primarily severance costs and asset write-downs related to
plans established to accomplish the integration of
Pillsbury.

Our fiscal 2002 results included restructuring
and other exit costs of $134 million, including charges related to the
sale of our Toledo, Ohio plant to International Multifoods Corporation
as required to obtain regulatory clearance for the acquisition of
Pillsbury, and to severance costs for sales organization and
headquarters department realignment.

Interest expense
increased 31 percent in fiscal 2003 due to the full-year impact of the
additional debt associated with the Pillsbury acquisition. Average
diluted shares outstanding were 378 million in fiscal 2003, up 11
percent from 342 million in fiscal 2002 due to the full-year impact of
shares issued to Diageo as part of the
acquisition.

U.S. RETAIL
SEGMENT.

Our U.S. Retail segment includes Big G
cereals, Meals, Pillsbury USA, Baking Products, Snacks, Yoplait-Colombo
and Small Planet Foods. Net sales for these operations totaled $7.41
billion in fiscal 2003, compared to $5.91 billion in fiscal 2002.
Operating profits totaled $1.75 billion, up 66 percent from the prior
year. Comparable unit volume grew 4 percent versus fiscal 2002 fueled
by an increase in product and marketing innovation. All of our U.S.
Retail businesses experienced volume growth except Baking Products,
which declined due to significant competitive promotional
activity.

BAKERIES AND
FOODSERVICE SEGMENT.

Our Bakeries and Foodservice
segment includes sales to wholesale and retail bakeries, foodservice
distributors, convenience stores, vending and foodservice operators.
Net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice operations reached $1.80
billion in fiscal 2003 compared to $1.26 billion in fiscal 2002, while
operating profit was $156 million, up only 1
percent from the prior year in spite of the inclusion of
twelve months of Pillsbury results in fiscal 2003 compared to seven
months of results included in fiscal 2002. Operating profits reflect
higher supply chain costs as operations were affected by manufacturing
realignments from the Pillsbury merger and higher commodity costs which
could not be recovered fully through pricing actions. Comparable unit
volume was essentially unchanged, reflecting overall weak foodservice
industry
trends.

INTERNATIONAL
SEGMENT.

Our International segment includes our
business in Canada, as well as our consolidated operations in Europe,
the Asia/Pacific region and Latin America. Net sales for our
International operations totaled $1.30 billion in fiscal 2003 compared
to $778 million in 2002. Operating profits grew to $91 million, more
than double last year’s $45 million total. Comparable unit volume
declined 1 percent for the year, driven by a 20 percent decline in
Latin America that was almost offset by strong volumes in Canada,
Europe and the Asia/Pacific
region.


PENSION
ACCOUNTING.

In fiscal 2003, we recorded net
pension and postretirement income of $42 million, net of $6 million of
curtailments, compared to $60 million, net of $11 million of
curtailments, in fiscal 2002. As detailed in Note Fourteen to the
consolidated financial statements, key assumptions that determine this
income include the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan
assets.

Our discount rate assumption is
determined annually based on the interest rate for long-term
high-quality corporate bonds. The discount rate used to determine the
pension and other postretirement obligations as of the balance sheet
date is the rate in effect as of that measurement date. That same
discount rate is also used to determine pension and other
postretirement income or expense for the following fiscal year. The
discount rates used in our pension and other postretirement assumptions
were 7.75 percent for the obligation as of May 27, 2001 and for our
fiscal 2002 income and expense estimate, 7.50 percent for the
obligation as of May 26, 2002 and for our fiscal 2003 income and
expense estimate, and 6.00 percent for the obligation as of May 25,
2003 and for our fiscal 2004 income and expense
estimate.

Our expected rate of return on plan assets is
determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment
performance, and our estimate of future long-term returns by asset
class using input from our actuaries, several consultants and
economists as well as long-term inflation assumptions. For fiscal 2002
and 2003, we assumed a rate of return of 10.4 percent on our pension
plan assets and 10.0 percent on our other postretirement plan assets.
For fiscal 2004 we have reduced our rate of return assumptions to 9.6
percent for assets in both plans.

In addition to our
assumptions about the discount rate and the expected rate of return on
plan assets, we base our determination of pension expense or income on
a market-related valuation of assets, which reduces year-to-year
volatility in accordance with SFAS No. 87, “Employers' Accounting
for Pensions.” This market-related valuation recognizes
investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in
which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the
difference between the expected return calculated using the
market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the
market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value of
assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future
value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses
are recorded. As of May 25, 2003, we had cumulative losses of
approximately $1.2 billion on our pension plans and $343 million on our
postretirement plans. These unrecognized net actuarial losses will
result in decreases in our future pension income if they continue to
exceed the corridor defined by SFAS No. 87.

For our fiscal
2004 pension and other postretirement income and expense estimate, we
have reduced the discount rate to 6.0 percent, based on interest rates
as of May 25, 2003. We have also reduced the expected rate of return on
plan assets to 9.6 percent. Based on these rates and various other
assumptions including the amortization of unrecognized net actuarial
losses, we estimate that our net pension and postretirement expense,
exclusive of curtailments, if any, will approximate $12 million in
fiscal 2004 compared to income of $48 million, exclusive of
curtailments, in fiscal 2003. Actual future net pension and
postretirement income or expense will depend on future investment
performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors
related to the populations participating in our pension and
postretirement plans.

Lowering the expected long-term rate
of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension
and postretirement expense for fiscal 2004 by approximately $17
million. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points would increase
our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal 2004 by
approximately $22 million.

Our pension plans were
underfunded by $224 million as of May 25, 2003. Based on our actuarial
assumptions, we expect required cash contributions of less than $10
million in fiscal 2004, and we made contributions of $9 million in
fiscal 2003 and $7 million in fiscal 2002. Our other postretirement
benefit plans were underfunded by $612 million as of May 25, 2003.
Based on our actuarial assumptions, we expect to make cash
contributions of approximately $20 million for each of the next three
years, which compares to actual cash contributions of $2 million in
fiscal 2003 and $29 million in fiscal
2002.

CORPORATE
ITEMS.

Net interest expense rose in fiscal 2003
to $547 million, which includes a full year of interest on the
additional debt incurred related to the Pillsbury acquisition. During
fiscal 2003 we issued approximately $2 billion of long-term debt
securities and used the proceeds to repay short-term debt. We have in
place a net amount of interest rate swaps that convert $1.5 billion of
floating rate debt to fixed rates. These swaps have an average life of
one year and have an average fixed rate of 5.0 percent. As of May 25,
2003, $49 million of pretax losses from these swap contracts were
recorded within accumulated other


comprehensive income. As explained in Note
Seven to the consolidated financial statements, when we issue fixed
rate debt, the corresponding interest rate swaps are dedesignated as
hedges and the amount related to those swaps within accumulated other
comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings over the life
of the interest rate swaps. Taking into account the effect of all of
our interest rate swaps, the average interest rate on our total debt is
approximately 5.9 percent. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2003 was 35
percent.

JOINT
VENTURES.

General Mills' proportionate share of
joint venture net sales grew to $997 million, compared to $777 million
in fiscal 2002. Total after-tax earnings from joint venture operations
almost doubled to reach $61 million in fiscal 2003, compared with $33
million reported a year earlier. Profits for Cereal Partners Worldwide
(CPW), our joint venture with Nestlé, and Snack Ventures Europe
(SVE), our joint venture with PepsiCo, together grew to $45 million. In
addition, Häagen-Dazs joint ventures contributed a full year of
results. These profit gains were partially offset by continued
marketing investment for 8th Continent, the Company’s soymilk joint
venture with
DuPont.

Results
of Operations — 2002 vs. 2001

General Mills
completed the acquisition of The Pillsbury Company on October 31, 2001.
Fiscal 2002 net sales grew 46 percent to $7.95 billion including the
seven months of Pillsbury results. Worldwide volume grew 49 percent,
although on a comparable basis, as if General Mills had owned Pillsbury
for all of fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002, volume grew slightly. Earnings
after tax declined 31 percent to $458 million. Net earnings per diluted
share declined 41 percent to $1.34, from $2.28 in fiscal 2001. This
significant reduction in General Mills’ earnings was caused by
the initial disruption of combining General Mills’ and
Pillsbury’s organizations.

Total U.S. Retail
comparable unit volume declined 1 percent in fiscal 2002. Volume gains
in Yoplait-Colombo, Snacks and Pillsbury USA were more than offset by
volume declines seen in Big G cereals, Meals and Baking Products. The
reduced volume resulted from the merger-related disruption to our sales
force and a reduced level of new products and promotional activity
during the integration period. Net sales in the U.S. Retail segment
grew to $5.91 billion from $4.57 billion. Operating profits were flat
at $1.06 billion. Foodservice results in fiscal 2002 included
comparable unit volume that was essentially unchanged from fiscal 2001.
Net sales more than doubled to $1.26 billion and operating profit grew
63 percent to reach $155 million. International comparable unit volume
grew 4 percent and net sales nearly tripled to $778 million. Operating
profit grew from $17 million to $45
million.

Impact of
Inflation

It is our view that changes in the general
rate of inflation have not had a significant effect on profitability
over the three most recent years. We attempt to minimize the effects of
inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices. Our
market risk management practices are discussed later in this
section.

Cash
Flows

Sources and uses of cash in the past three
years are shown in the following table. Over the most recent three-year
period, General Mills' operations have generated $3.3 billion in cash.
In 2003, cash flow from operations totaled $1.6 billion. That was up
from the previous year due primarily to a $456 million increase in
operating earnings before depreciation, amortization, restructuring and
other exit costs, as well as a $209 million increase from a reduction
in working capital.


CASH
SOURCES
(USES)

In
fiscal 2003, capital investment for land, building and equipment and
intangibles grew to $750 million, including expenditures for the
construction of new facilities at our Minneapolis headquarters campus
and expenditures associated with the acquisition and integration of
Pillsbury. We expect capital expenditures to decrease in fiscal 2004,
to approximately $650 million, as integration-related activities are
completed.

Dividends in 2003 totaled $1.10 per share, a
payout of 45 percent of diluted earnings per share. We intend to
maintain the prevailing $1.10 annual dividend rate per share in fiscal
2004, but would expect to increase that rate in the longer term as our
earnings increase.

We did not repurchase a significant
number of shares in fiscal 2003, nor do we expect to repurchase a
significant number of shares in fiscal 2004.

During fiscal
2003 General Mills paid Diageo $273 million under the Contingent Value
Right (CVR) agreement that was part of the Pillsbury transaction. The
CVR required General Mills to pay Diageo up to $395 million, or $5 per
share on 79 million shares, depending on the price of General Mills
common stock for the 20 trading days prior to April 30, 2003. In fiscal
2003 General Mills also paid $89 million to Diageo for three-year call
options on 29 million General Mills shares. These options were
purchased in conjunction with a General Mills convertible bond offering
discussed
below.

Financial
Condition

Our notes payable and total long-term debt
totaled $8.9 billion as of May 25, 2003. We also consider our leases
and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our debt
structure, and we use a measurement of “adjusted debt plus
minority interests,” as shown in the table below. This adjusted
debt plus minority interests declined slightly to just over $9.0
billion, and our stockholders' equity grew to $4.2 billion primarily
due to the increase in retained earnings. The market value of General
Mills stockholders' equity increased as well, due to price appreciation
and the increase in shares outstanding. As of May 25, 2003, our equity
market capitalization was $17.2 billion, based on a price of $46.56 per
share and 370 million basic shares outstanding.


CAPITAL
STRUCTURE

In
fiscal 2003 we refinanced approximately $2 billion of our short-term
debt through the following issuances: $135 million of 3.875 percent
5-year notes, $350 million of 3.9 percent 5-year bonds, $72 million of
notes at various rates, and $1.50 billion of zero-coupon 2 percent
convertible debentures. The debentures are convertible into a total of
29 million shares of General Mills’ common stock. (See Note Eight
to the consolidated financial statements for further information
regarding the debenture issue.) In order to prevent share dilution in
the event of conversion, we purchased call options for 29 million
shares from Diageo. The purchase price for the call options was $89
million. If the owners of the debentures exercise their right of
conversion, we intend to exercise our options to purchase
Diageo’s shares so that total shares outstanding remain
constant.

As discussed earlier, we have entered into
interest rate swap contracts to lock in our interest rate on our
floating-rate debt. Combined, over 80 percent of our debt is now
fixed-rate.

We consider our leases and deferred income
taxes related to tax leases as part of our fixed-rate obligations. The
next table, when reviewed in conjunction with the capital structure
table, shows the composition of our debt structure including the impact
of using derivative
instruments.

Commercial paper is
a continuing source of short-term financing. We can issue commercial
paper in the United States and Canada, as well as in Europe, through a
program established in fiscal 1999. Our commercial paper borrowings are
supported by $2.2 billion in committed credit lines. Currently, we have
no outstanding borrowings under these credit lines. Additionally, we
have $221 million in uncommitted credit lines available. The following
table details the fee-paid credit lines we had available as of May 25,
2003.

Our
fixed charge coverage in fiscal 2003 was 3.2 times compared to 2.5
times in fiscal 2002. We expect to pay down at least $450 million of
debt in 2004, as part of a cumulative $2.0 billion reduction in
adjusted debt planned over the next three years through fiscal 2006.
Our goal is to return to a mid single-A rating for our long-term debt,
and to the top tier short-term rating, where we were prior to our
announcement of the Pillsbury
acquisition.

Currently, Standard and Poor’s
Corporation has ratings of “BBB+” on our publicly held
long-term debt and “A-2” on our commercial paper. Moody’s
Investors Services, Inc. has ratings of “Baa2” for our
long-term debt and “P-2” for our commercial paper. Fitch
Ratings, Inc. rates our long-term debt “BBB+” and our
commercial paper “F-2.” Dominion Bond Rating Service in
Canada currently rates General Mills as
“A-low.”

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

It is
not our general business practice to enter into off-balance sheet
arrangements nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to third parties.
We have, however, issued guarantees of approximately $172 million for
the debt and other obligations of unconsolidated affiliates, primarily
CPW and SVE. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally
limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases,
which totaled approximately $454 million at May 25,
2003.

The following table summarizes our future estimated
cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including
payments due by period. The majority of the purchase obligations
represent commitments for projected raw material and packaging needs to
be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer-directed

New
Accounting Rules

Effective the first quarter of
fiscal 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.” The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

In November 2002, the Financial Accounting
Standard Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation Number 45 (FIN 45),
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” FIN 45 elaborates on the
disclosure requirements of guarantees, as well as requiring the
recording of certain guarantees issued or modified after December 31,
2002. We do not believe that the adoption of FIN 45 requires any
material change in our guarantee disclosures. (See Note Seventeen to
the consolidated financial statements.) We have not entered into any
recordable guarantees since December 31, 2002.

In July
2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” SFAS No. 146
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal
activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a
commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No. 146 is to be applied
prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December
31, 2002. The adoption of this Standard affects the timing of the
recognition of future exit or disposal costs, as no exit or disposal
activities were initiated after December 31, 2002.


On the first day of fiscal 2002, we
adopted three new accounting rules. SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” requires all
derivatives to be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and
establishes new accounting rules for hedging. We recorded the
cumulative effect of adopting this accounting change in fiscal 2002, as
described in Note One (O) to the consolidated financial
statements.

We also adopted SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations,” which requires use of the purchase method of
accounting for all business combinations initiated after June 30,
2001.

The third Statement we adopted at the start of fiscal
2002 was SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets.”
This Statement eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead
requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment. Goodwill
amortization expense in fiscal 2001 totaled $23 million pretax, $22
million after tax. Transitional impairment tests of our goodwill did
not require adjustment to any of our goodwill carrying values. The
effects on net earnings and earnings per share for the adoption of SFAS
No. 142 are described in Note One (O) to the consolidated financial
statements.

The FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) Issue 01-09, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a
Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor’s
Products,” requires recording certain coupon and trade promotion
expenses as reductions of revenues and was effective for us in our
fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Since adopting this requirement resulted
only in the reclassification of certain expenses from selling, general
and administrative expense to a reduction of net sales, it did not
affect our financial position or net earnings.

In December
2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.” SFAS No. 148
provides companies with alternative methods of transition to the fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.
We use the intrinsic value method of accounting, and have not elected
the fair value based method of accounting. SFAS No. 148 also amends the
disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an
entity’s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based
employee compensation, as reflected in Note One (L) to the consolidated
financial statements. Finally, SFAS No. 148 requires disclosure about
those effects in future interim financial information.

In
May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and
Equity.” SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer
classifies and measures certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Many of these
instruments were previously classified as equity. SFAS No. 150 requires
that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope
as a liability, or as an asset in some circumstances. This Statement
applies to three types of freestanding financial instruments, other
than outstanding shares. One type is mandatorily redeemable shares,
which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash
or assets; a second type includes put options and forward purchase
contracts that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of
its shares in exchange for cash or other assets; the third type is
obligations that can be settled with shares, the monetary value of
which is fixed, ties solely or predominantly to a variable such as a
market index, or varies inversely with the value of the issuers’
shares. SFAS No. 150 does not apply to features embedded in a financial
instrument that is not a derivative in its entirety.

SFAS
No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified
after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the
first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. For us, it will be
implemented in our second quarter of fiscal 2004 by reporting the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for financial
instruments created before the issuance date of the Statement and still
existing at the beginning of that period. Restatement is not permitted.
The adoption of this Statement is not expected to have a material
impact on our financial
statements.

Market
Risk Management

Our Company is exposed to market risk
stemming from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and
commodity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in
our earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we
actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into
various hedging transactions, authorized under company policies that
place clear controls on these activities. The counterparties in these
transactions are highly rated financial institutions. Our hedging
transactions include (but are not limited to) the use of a variety of
derivative financial instruments. We use derivatives only where there
is an underlying exposure; we do not use them for trading or
speculative purposes. Additional information regarding our use of
financial instruments is included in Note Seven to the consolidated
financial statements.


Interest
Rates.

We manage our debt structure and our
interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt,
and through the use of derivatives. We use interest rate swaps to hedge
our exposure to interest rate changes, and also to reduce volatility of
our financing costs. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a
counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and
floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal
amount. Our primary exposure is to U.S. interest rates. As of May 25,
2003, we had $10.5 billion of agreed notional principal amounts (the
principal amount on which the fixed or floating interest rate is
calculated) outstanding, including amounts that neutralize exposure
through offsetting swaps (see Notes Seven and Eight to the consolidated
financial
statements).

Foreign
Currency Rates.

Foreign currency fluctuations can
affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign
currencies. We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts and
option contracts to selectively hedge our cash flow exposure to changes
in exchange rates. These contracts function as hedges, since they
change in value inversely to the change created in the underlying
exposure as foreign exchange rates fluctuate. Our primary exchange rate
exposures are with the Canadian dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen and
the British pound against the U.S.
dollar.

Commodities.

Certain
ingredients used in our products are exposed to commodity price
changes. We manage this risk through an integrated set of financial
instruments, including purchase orders, noncancelable contracts,
futures contracts, futures options and swaps. Our primary commodity
price exposures are to cereal grains, sugar, vegetables, fruits, other
agricultural products, vegetable oils, packaging materials and energy
costs.

Value
at Risk.

These estimates are intended to measure
the maximum potential fair value General Mills could lose in one day
from adverse changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates
or commodity prices, under normal market conditions. A Monte Carlo
(VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our
exposures. The models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95
percent confidence level.

The VAR calculation
used historical interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity
prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and
correlation of these rates in the future. The market data were drawn
from the RiskMetrics(TM) data set. The calculations are not intended to
represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur. Further,
since the hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with
the underlying exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the
fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase
or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures. The
positions included in the calculations were: debt; investments;
interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards and options; and
commodity swaps, futures and options. The calculations do not include
the underlying foreign exchange and commodities-related positions that
are hedged by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.

The
table below presents the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in
fair value for our interest rate, foreign currency and commodity
market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding on May 25, 2003. The
amounts were calculated using the VAR methodology described
earlier.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
RESPONSIBILITIES

The management of General Mills,
Inc. is responsible for the fairness and accuracy of the consolidated
financial statements. The statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United
States, using management’s best estimates and judgments where
appropriate. The financial information throughout this Annual Report on
Form 10-K is consistent with our consolidated financial
statements.

Management has established a system of internal
controls that provides reasonable assurance that assets are adequately
safeguarded and transactions are recorded accurately in all material
respects, in accordance with management’s authorization. We
maintain a strong audit program that independently evaluates the
adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls. Our internal controls
provide for appropriate separation of duties and responsibilities, and
there are documented policies regarding use of Company assets and
proper financial reporting. These formally stated and regularly
communicated policies demand highly ethical conduct from all
employees.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
meets regularly with management, internal auditors and independent
auditors to review internal control, auditing and financial reporting
matters. The independent auditors, internal auditors and employees have
full and free access to the Audit Committee at any
time.

The independent auditors, KPMG LLP, were
retained to audit our consolidated financial statements. Their report

INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS’ REPORT

The Stockholders and the
Board of Directors of General Mills, Inc.:

We have audited
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Mills, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of May 25, 2003 and May 26, 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and
cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended
May 25, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
May 25, 2003 and May 26, 2002, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period
ended May 25, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of
America.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Preparing
our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from our estimates.

Certain prior years’
amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year
presentation. Certain expenses have been reclassified from cost of
sales to selling, general and administrative expense to more
appropriately categorize various expenses that are not clearly
associated with production activity. In addition, certain items
previously reported as unusual items have been reclassified to
restructuring and other exit costs, to selling, general and
administrative expense, and to cost of
sales.

(A)
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

Our consolidated
financial statements include parent company operations and
majority-owned subsidiaries as well as General Mills’ investment
in and share of net earnings or losses of 20- to 50-percent-owned
companies, which are recorded on an equity basis.

Our
fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in May. Fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001
each consisted of 52 weeks. Our wholly owned international operations,
with the exception of Canada and our export operations, are reported
for the 12 calendar months ending April 30. The results of the acquired
Pillsbury operations are reflected in our financial results from
November 1,
2001.

(B)
LAND, BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION

Buildings and equipment are depreciated over estimated useful
lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Buildings are usually
depreciated over 40 to 50 years, and equipment is depreciated over
three to 15 years. Depreciation charges for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001
were $347 million, $283 million and $194 million, respectively.
Accelerated depreciation methods generally are used for income tax
purposes. When an item is sold or retired, the accounts are relieved of
its cost and related accumulated depreciation; the resulting gains and
losses, if any, are
recognized.

(C)
INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at the lower of
cost or market. We generally use the LIFO method of valuing inventory
because we believe that it is a better match with current revenues.
However, FIFO is used for most foreign operations, where LIFO is not
recognized for income tax purposes and the operations often lack the
staff to handle LIFO complexities accurately.

(D) INTANGIBLE
ASSETS

Goodwill represents the difference between
the purchase prices of acquired companies and the related fair values
of net assets acquired and accounted for by the purchase method of
accounting. On May 28, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Intangible
Assets.” This Statement eliminates the amortization of goodwill
and intangibles with indefinite lives, primarily acquired brand
intangibles, and instead requires that they be tested annually for
impairment. See Note One (O) for the effects of this adoption. We
capitalize the costs of software internally developed or externally
purchased for internal use. The costs of patents, copyrights and other
amortizable intangible assets are amortized evenly over their estimated
useful
lives.

(E)
RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

We review
long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles and goodwill, for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An asset is deemed
impaired and written down to its fair value if estimated related future
cash flows are less than its carrying
amount.


(F)
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

For most of our
foreign operations, local currencies are considered the functional
currency. Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates in
effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated
using the average exchange rates during the period. Translation effects
are classified within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in
Stockholders’ Equity.

(G) FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

See Note One (O) for a description of
our adoption of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.” We use interest rate swaps,
currency swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks
generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and
commodity market volatility. All hedging instruments are designated and
effective as hedges, in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. If the underlying hedged transaction
ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives
that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings.
Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to
market with changes recognized in current earnings. We do not hold or
issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and we are
not a party to leveraged derivatives. See Note Seven for additional
information related to our financial
instruments.

(H) REVENUE
RECOGNITION

We recognize sales upon shipment to
our customers consistent with sales terms. We generally do not allow a
right of return. Reported sales are net of certain coupon and trade
promotion costs. Coupons are expensed when distributed based on
estimated redemptions. Trade promotions are expensed based on estimated
participation and performance levels for offered
programs.

(I)
SHIPPING AND HANDLING

Shipping and handling costs
associated with internal movements of inventories are recorded as cost
of sales and recognized when the related finished product is shipped to
the customer. Shipping costs associated with the distribution of
finished product to our customers are recorded as selling, general and
administrative expense and are recognized when the related finished
product is shipped to the customer. The amount recorded in selling,
general and administrative expense was $345 million, $243 million and
$161 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

(J) RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT

All expenditures for research and
development are charged against earnings in the year incurred. The
charges for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $149 million, $131 million
and $83 million, respectively.

(K) ADVERTISING
COSTS

Advertising expenses (including production
and communication costs) for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $519
million, $489 million and $358 million, respectively. Prepaid
advertising costs (including syndication properties) of $31 million and
$36 million were reported as assets at May 25, 2003, and May 26, 2002,
respectively. We expense the production costs of advertising the first
time that the advertising takes
place.


(L)
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

We use the intrinsic
value method for measuring the cost of compensation paid in Company
common stock. This method defines our cost as the excess of the
stock’s market value at the time of the grant over the amount
that the employee is required to pay. Our stock option plans require
that the employee’s payment (i.e., exercise price) be the market
value as of the grant date. The following table illustrates the pro
forma effect on net earnings and earnings per share if the company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to stock-based
employee
compensation.

The
weighted average fair values at grant date of the options granted in
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 were estimated as $8.24, $11.77 and $8.78,
respectively, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following weighted average
assumptions:

The
Black-Scholes model requires the input of certain key assumptions, does
not give effect to restrictions that are placed on employee stock
options, and therefore may not provide a reliable measure of fair
value.

(M)
EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic Earnings per Share (EPS)
is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS includes the effect of all
dilutive potential common shares (primarily related to outstanding
in-the-money stock
options).

(N)
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

We consider all
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less
to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents totaling $211 million
and $77 million at May 25, 2003 and May 26, 2002, respectively, are
designated as collateral for certain derivative
liabilities.

(O)
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Effective the first
quarter of fiscal 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The adoption of
SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In November
2002, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation Number 45 (FIN 45), “Guarantor’s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.” FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosure requirements of
guarantees, as well as requiring the recording of certain guarantees
issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We do not believe that the
adoption of FIN 45 requires any material change in our guarantee
disclosures (see Note Seventeen). We have not entered into any
recordable guarantees since December 31, 2002.


In July 2002, FASB issued SFAS No.
146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities.” SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs
associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred
rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan.
SFAS No. 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal
activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this
Standard affects the timing of the recognition of future exit or
disposal costs, as no exit or disposal activities were initiated after
December 31, 2002.

On the first day of fiscal 2002, we
adopted three new accounting rules. SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” requires all
derivatives to be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and
establishes new accounting rules for hedging. We recorded the
cumulative effect of adopting this accounting change in fiscal 2002, as
follows:

This
cumulative effect was primarily associated with the impact of lower
interest rates on the fair-value calculation for delayed-starting
interest rate swaps we entered into in anticipation of our Pillsbury
acquisition and other financing requirements. Refer to Note Seven and
Note Ten for more information.

We also adopted SFAS No.
141, “Business Combinations,” which requires use of the
purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001.

The third Statement we adopted at the
start of fiscal 2002 was SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Intangible
Assets.” This Statement eliminates the amortization of goodwill
and instead requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill amortization expense in fiscal 2001 totaled $23 million
pretax, $22 million after tax. Transitional impairment tests of our
goodwill did not require adjustment to any of our goodwill carrying
values.

The following table adjusts earnings and earnings
per share for the adoption of SFAS No.
142.

The
FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 01-09,
“Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or
a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products,” requires recording
certain coupon and trade promotion expenses as reductions of revenues
and was effective for us in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Since
adopting this requirement resulted only in the reclassification of
certain expenses from selling, general and administrative expense to a
reduction of net sales, it did not affect our financial position or net
earnings.


In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure.” SFAS No. 148 provides companies with
alternative methods of transition to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. We have not elected
the fair value based method of accounting. SFAS No. 148 also amends the
disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an
entity’s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based
employee compensation, as reflected in Note One (L) to the consolidated
financial statements. Finally, SFAS No. 148 requires disclosure about
those effects in future interim financial information.

In
May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.” SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer
classifies and measures certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Many of these
instruments were previously classified as equity. SFAS No. 150 requires
that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope
as a liability, or as an asset in some circumstances. This Statement
applies to three types of freestanding financial instruments, other
than outstanding shares. One type is mandatorily redeemable shares,
which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash
or assets; a second type includes put options and forward purchase
contracts that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of
its shares in exchange for cash or other assets; the third type is
obligations that can be settled with shares, the monetary value of
which is fixed, ties solely or predominantly to a variable such as a
market index, or varies inversely with the value of the issuers’
shares. SFAS No. 150 does not apply to features embedded in a financial
instrument that is not a derivative in its entirety.

SFAS
No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified
after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the
first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. For us, it will be
implemented in our second quarter of fiscal 2004 by reporting the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for financial
instruments created before the issuance date of the Statement and still
existing at the beginning of that period. Restatement is not permitted.
The adoption of this Statement is not expected to have a material
impact on our financial
statements.

2. ACQUISITIONS

On October 31, 2001, we acquired the worldwide
Pillsbury operations from Diageo plc (Diageo). Pillsbury, based in
Minneapolis, Minnesota, built a portfolio of leading food brands, such
as

Pillsbury

refrigerated dough,

Green Giant, Old El
Paso, Progresso

and

Totino’s

. Pillsbury had
sales of $6.1 billion (before EITF Issue 01-09 reclassification) in its
fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, including businesses subsequently
divested. We believe the addition of Pillsbury’s businesses will
enhance our future growth and generate significant cost
synergies.

The transaction was accounted for as a
purchase. Under terms of the agreement between General Mills and
Diageo, we acquired Pillsbury in a stock and cash transaction.
Consideration to Diageo included 134 million General Mills common
shares. Under a stockholders’ agreement, Diageo had a put option
to sell directly to us 55 million shares of General Mills common stock
at a price of $42.14 per share, which Diageo exercised on November 1,
2001. Therefore, those 55 million shares were valued at a total of
$2,318 million. The 79 million shares of General Mills common stock
retained by Diageo were valued at $3,576 million based on the three-day
average trading price prior to the closing of $45.27 per share.
Therefore, the total stock consideration was $5,894
million. The cash paid to Diageo and assumed debt of
Pillsbury on October 31, 2001 totaled $3,830 million. Under terms of
the agreement, Diageo held contingent value rights that required
payment to Diageo on April 30, 2003, of up to $395 million, based on
the General Mills stock price and the number of General Mills shares
that Diageo continued to hold on that date. Diageo received $273
million based on the average price of General Mills stock of $45.55 per
share for the 20 trading days prior to that date and the 79 million
shares Diageo held. As a result, the total acquisition consideration
(exclusive of direct acquisition costs) was approximately $9,997
million.

The stockholders’ agreement between General
Mills and Diageo includes a standstill provision, under which Diageo is
precluded from buying additional shares in General Mills for a 20-year
period following the close of the transaction, or for three years
following the date on which Diageo owns less than 5 percent of General
Mills’ outstanding shares, whichever is earlier. The agreement
also generally requires pass-through voting by Diageo, so its shares
will be voted in the same proportion as the other General Mills shares
are voted. So long as Diageo owns at least 50 percent of the 134
million shares it originally received in this transaction, Diageo may
designate two individuals to the General Mills Board of
Directors.

was completed in fiscal 2003. Intangible assets included in the final
allocation of the purchase price were acquired brands totaling $3.5
billion and goodwill of $5.8 billion. Deferred income taxes of $1.3
billion, associated with the brand intangibles, were also
recorded.

Presented below is a condensed balance
sheet disclosing the final purchase price allocation with the amounts
assigned to major asset and liability captions of the acquired
Pillsbury business at the date of acquisition (in
millions):

In
February 2002, we decided to close two Pillsbury facilities in order to
utilize the operating capacity of the newly combined companies more
fully. We closed the Geneva, Illinois plant, which produced frozen
breakfast products; and the Anthony, Texas production facility, which
produced various Mexican food products. Initial exit liabilities
connected to these plant closures amounted to $22 million and have been
included in the purchase price allocation of Pillsbury, along with $162
million of fair value adjustments to fixed assets. Approximately 370
employees were affected by these two plant closures.

In the
course of completing the purchase price allocation during fiscal 2003,
adjustments were made as management finalized plans to exit certain
Pillsbury facilities as part of consolidating manufacturing, warehouse
and distribution activities into fewer locations. In the first quarter,
we announced that we would close the Hillsdale, Michigan plant which
produced dry mix products and flour for our Bakeries and Foodservice
business. The production capacity for the dry mix product lines will be
absorbed within other facilities throughout the General Mills supply
chain, while the flour mill business will be sold. A total of 119
employees were affected by the closure. In the second quarter, we
announced plans to close plants in Eden Prairie, Minnesota; St. Louis,
Missouri; Lithonia, Georgia; and Denison, Texas. The Eden Prairie
plant, which is planned to close in the fall of 2003, employs 323
people and produces frozen breakfast products for the Company’s
Bakeries and Foodservice segment. The St. Louis plant, which is planned
to close in the fall of 2003, employs 421 people and produces frozen
bakery goods for the Company’s Bakeries and Foodservice segment. The
Lithonia plant, which is planned to close in the summer of 2003,
employs 215 people and produces refrigerated dough products for the
Company’s U.S. Retail segment. The Denison plant, which was
closed in the spring of 2003, employed 243 people and produced
refrigerated dough products for the Company’s U.S. Retail
segment. Initial exit liabilities related to these plant closures
amounted to $44 million and have been included in the purchase price
allocation of Pillsbury, along with $72 million of fair value
adjustments to fixed assets. We do not anticipate any significant loss
associated with the exit liabilities established pursuant to the
acquisition.

In order to obtain
regulatory clearance for the acquisition of Pillsbury, we arranged to
divest certain businesses. On November 13, 2001, International
Multifoods Corporation (IMC) purchased the Pillsbury dessert and
specialty products businesses as well as certain General Mills brands
and the General Mills Toledo, Ohio plant for $316 million. After-tax
cash proceeds from this transaction were used to reduce General Mills
debt.

As part of the transaction, IMC received an exclusive
royalty-free license to use the

Doughboy

trademark and

Pillsbury

brand in the desserts and baking mix categories.
The licenses are renewable without cost in 20-year increments at
IMC’s discretion. Since the sale of the assets to IMC was
integral to the Pillsbury acquisition, and because the assets sold were
adjusted to fair market value as part of the purchase of Pillsbury,
there was no gain or loss recorded on the sale in the Company’s
consolidated statement of earnings.


Pillsbury had a
50 percent equity interest in Ice Cream Partners USA LLC (ICP), a joint
venture Pillsbury formed with Nestlé USA during fiscal 2000, for
the manufacture, marketing and distribution of

Häagen-Dazs

and Nestlé ice cream products in
the United States. On December 26, 2001, Nestlé USA exercised
its right, triggered by the change of ownership of Pillsbury, to buy
the 50 percent stake of ICP that it did not already own. Nestlé
paid us $641 million for our 50 percent of the joint venture and a
long-term, paid-in-full license for the

Häagen-Dazs

brand in the United States. Net proceeds from this transaction
also were used to reduce our debt level.

We reconfigured
our cereal production as a result of selling our Toledo, Ohio plant to
IMC (see Note Three).

Actual results of acquired
business operations are included in the consolidated statement of
earnings for the period from November 1, 2001, through May 26, 2002.
The following unaudited pro forma information presents a summary of our
consolidated results of operations and the acquired Pillsbury
operations as if the acquisition had occurred on May 29,

results of the consolidated
entities.

3. RESTRUCTURING
AND OTHER EXIT COSTS

In fiscal 2003, we recorded
restructuring and other exit costs totaling $62 million pursuant to
approved plans related to the acquisition of Pillsbury. These costs
consisted of $41 million of charges associated with the closure of our
St. Charles, Illinois plant, $13 million of expense relating to exiting
production at former Pillsbury facilities being closed, and $8 million
for flour mill, grain and other restructuring/closing charges. These
fiscal 2003 costs include severance related to 264 St. Charles plant
employees and the write-down of $31 million of production assets,
primarily the St. Charles facility in our Bakeries and Foodservice
segment. The carrying value of the assets written down was $36
million.

In fiscal 2002, we recorded restructuring
and other exit costs totaling $134 million pursuant to approved plans,
primarily related to the acquisition of Pillsbury. These costs
consisted of $87 million of severance and asset write-down costs
related to the reconfiguration of cereal production to obtain
regulatory clearance for the acquisition of Pillsbury, $38 million of
severance costs related to sales organization and headquarters
department realignment, and $9 million for two flour mill
restructuring/closing charges. The cereal reconfiguration charges were
necessitated by the sale of our Toledo, Ohio plant as required to
obtain regulatory clearance for the acquisition of Pillsbury. The
severance costs related to 1,078 employees. These employees included
all levels and a variety of areas within the Company, including
management, supervisory, technical and production personnel. The
restructuring and other exit costs also included the write-down of $52
million of cereal production assets and $6 million of flour production
assets, primarily in our U.S. Retail segment. The carrying value of
these assets was $58 million, net of amounts transferred to other
facilities.

In fiscal 2001, we made the decision to exit
the

Squeezit

beverage business. The charge associated with
this action, primarily noncash write-downs associated with asset
disposals, totaled $12 million.


The analysis of our restructuring and
other exit costs activity is as
follows:


4.
INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES

We have a 50 percent
equity interest in Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), a joint venture
with Nestlé that manufactures and markets ready-to-eat cereals
outside the United States and Canada. We have a 40.5 percent equity
interest in Snack Ventures Europe (SVE), a joint venture with PepsiCo
that manufactures and markets snack foods in continental Europe. We
have a 50 percent equity interest in 8th Continent, LLC, a domestic
joint venture formed in fiscal 2001 with DuPont to develop and market
soy foods and beverages. As a result of the Pillsbury acquisition, we
have 50 percent interests in the following joint ventures for the
manufacture, distribution and marketing of

Häagen-Dazs

frozen ice cream products and novelties:
Häagen-Dazs Japan K.K., Häagen-Dazs Korea Company Limited,
Häagen-Dazs Taiwan Limited, Häagen-Dazs Distributors
(Thailand) Company Limited, and Häagen-Dazs Marketing &
Distribution (Philippines) Inc. We also have a 50 percent interest in
Seretram, a joint venture with Co-op de Pau for the production of

Green Giant

canned corn in France. In July 2003, we
purchased the remaining 50 percent interest in the Taiwan
venture.

The joint ventures are reflected in our
financial statements on an equity accounting basis. We record our share
of the earnings or losses of these joint ventures. (The table that
follows reflects the joint ventures on a 100 percent basis.) We also
receive royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur various
expenses (primarily research and development) and record the tax impact
of certain joint venture operations that are structured as
partnerships.

Our cumulative investment in these joint
ventures (including our share of earnings and losses) was $372 million,
$326 million and $218 million at the end of fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. We made aggregate investments in the joint ventures of
$17 million, $38 million and $25 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. We received aggregate dividends from the joint ventures
of $95 million, $17 million and $3 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

Summary combined financial information
for the joint ventures on a 100 percent basis follows. Since we record
our share of CPW results on a two-month lag, CPW information is
included as of and for the 12 months ended March 31. The
Häagen-Dazs and Seretram joint ventures are reported as of and for
the 12 months ended April 30, 2003 and for the six months ended April
30, 2002. The SVE and 8th Continent information is consistent with our
May year-end.

5. BALANCE
SHEET INFORMATION

The components of certain balance
sheet accounts are as
follows:


The changes in the carrying amount of
goodwill for fiscal 2002 and 2003 are as
follows:

The Pillsbury
acquisition valuation and purchase price allocation was completed in
fiscal 2003. The activity during fiscal 2003 primarily reflects the
allocation of the purchase price to brand intangibles, net of tax, and
the Contingent Value Rights (CVR) payment to Diageo (see Note Two,
“Acquisitions”).

Intangible asset amortization
expense was $18 million, $13 million and $6 million for fiscal 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. Estimated amortization expense for the
next five fiscal years (in millions) is as follows: $17 in 2004, $14 in
2005, $12 in 2006, $10 in 2007 and $10 in 2008.

As of May
25, 2003, a comparison of cost and market values of our marketable
securities (which are debt and equity securities) was as
follows:

As
of May 25, 2003, $53 million was designated as collateral for certain
derivative liabilities.

Realized gains from sales of
marketable securities were $14 million, $15 million and $4 million in
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The aggregate unrealized
gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of tax effects,
are classified in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income within
Stockholders’ Equity.

Scheduled maturities of our
marketable securities are as

negligible impact on fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 earnings. Results of
operations were not materially affected by a liquidation of LIFO
inventory. The difference between replacement cost and the stated LIFO
inventory value is not materially different from the reserve for LIFO
valuation method.

The
Company is exposed to certain market risks as a part of its ongoing
business operations and uses derivative financial and commodity
instruments, where appropriate, to manage these risks. Derivatives are
financial instruments whose value is derived from one or more
underlying financial instruments. Examples of underlying instruments
are currencies, equities, commodities and interest rates. In general,
instruments used as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk
associated with the exposure being hedged, and must be designated as a
hedge at the inception of the contract.

With the adoption
of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” as of May 28, 2001, we record the fair value
of all outstanding derivatives in receivables or other liabilities.
Gains and losses related to the ineffective portion of any hedge are
recorded in various costs and expenses, depending on the nature of the
derivative.

Each derivative transaction we enter into is
designated at inception as a hedge of risks associated with specific
assets, liabilities or future commitments, and is monitored to
determine if it remains an effective hedge. Effectiveness is based on
changes in the derivative’s market value or cash flows being
highly correlated with changes in market value or cash flows of the
underlying hedged item. We do not enter into or hold derivatives for
trading or speculative purposes. None of our derivative instruments is
excluded from our assessment of hedge effectiveness.

We use
derivative instruments to reduce financial risk in three areas:
interest rates, foreign currency and commodities. The notional amounts
of derivatives do not represent actual amounts exchanged by the parties
and, thus, are not a measure of the Company’s exposure through
its use of derivatives. We enter into interest rate swap, foreign
exchange, and commodity swap


agreements with a diversified group of
highly rated counterparties. We enter into commodity futures
transactions through various regulated exchanges. These transactions
may expose the Company to credit risk to the extent that the
instruments have a positive fair value, but we have not experienced any
material losses nor do we anticipate any losses. The Company does not
have a significant concentration of risk with any single party or group
of parties in any of its financial instruments.

Qualifying
derivatives are reported as part of hedge arrangements as
follows:

CASH FLOW
HEDGES —

Gains and losses on these
instruments are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income until the
underlying transaction is recorded in earnings. When the hedged item is
realized, gains or losses are reclassified from Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings on the
same line item as the underlying transaction risk. When we issue fixed
rate debt, the corresponding interest rate swaps are dedesignated as
hedges and the amount related to those swaps within Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income are reclassified into earnings over the life of
the interest rate swaps.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE
TRANSACTION RISK — The Company is exposed to fluctuations in
foreign currency cash flows related primarily to third-party purchases,
intercompany product shipments, and intercompany loans. Forward
contracts of generally less than 12 months duration are used to hedge
some of these risks. Effectiveness is assessed based on changes in
forward rates.

INTEREST RATE RISK — The Company is
exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing
variable-rate debt and planned future issuances of fixed-rate debt. The
Company uses interest rate swaps, including forward-starting swaps, to
reduce interest rate volatility, and to achieve a desired proportion of
variable vs. fixed-rate debt, based on current and projected market
conditions.

Variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps are
accounted for as cash flow hedges, with effectiveness assessed based on
either the hypothetical derivative method or changes in the present
value of interest payments on the underlying debt. The amount of hedge
ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in fiscal 2003 and
2002.

PRICE RISK — The Company is exposed to price
fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of
ingredient and packaging materials. The Company uses a combination of
long cash positions with suppliers, exchange-traded futures and option
contracts and over-the-counter hedging mechanisms to reduce price
fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases over a
period of generally less than one year. Commodity contracts are
accounted for as cash flow hedges, with effectiveness assessed based on
changes in futures prices. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was $1
million in fiscal 2003 and less than $1 million
in fiscal 2002. Losses of $2 million were reclassified into earnings as
a result of the discontinuance of commodity cash flow hedges in fiscal
2003.

We use a grain merchandising operation to provide us
efficient access to and more informed knowledge of various commodities
markets. This operation uses futures and options to hedge its net
inventory position to minimize market exposure. As of May 25, 2003, our
grain merchandising operation had futures and options contracts that
essentially hedged its net inventory position. None of the contracts
extended beyond May 2004. All futures contracts and futures options are
exchange-based instruments with ready liquidity and determinable market
values. Neither results of operations nor the year-end positions from
our grain merchandising operation were material to the Company’s
overall results.

Unrealized losses from cash flow hedges
recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as of May 25, 2003,
totaled $439 million, primarily related to interest rate swaps we
entered into in contemplation of future borrowings and other financing
requirements (primarily related to the Pillsbury acquisition), which
are being reclassified into interest expense over the life of the
interest rate hedge (see Note Eight regarding swaps settled or
neutralized). The estimated net amount of the existing gains and losses
in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as of May 25, 2003 that is
expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months
is $170 million net expense.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES
—

Fair value hedges involve recognized
assets, liabilities or firm commitments as the hedged
risks.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION RISK —
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency
investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related primarily to
repatriation of these investments. Forward contracts, generally less
than


12 months duration, are used to hedge some
of these risks. Effectiveness is assessed based on changes in forward
rates. Effective gains and losses on these instruments are recorded as
a foreign currency translation adjustment in Other Comprehensive
Income.

The Company enters into foreign currency forward
contracts to reduce volatility in the translation of foreign currency
earnings to U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on these instruments are
recorded in selling, general and administrative expense, generally
reducing the exposure to translation volatility during a full-year
period.

Our net balance sheet exposure consists of the net
investment in foreign operations, translated using the exchange rates
in effect at the balance sheet date and amounted to approximately $700
million at May 25, 2003 and May 26, 2002.

INTEREST RATE
RISK — The Company currently uses interest rate swaps to reduce
volatility of funding costs associated with certain debt issues and to
achieve a desired proportion of variable vs. fixed-rate debt, based on
current and projected market conditions.

Fixed-to-variable
interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges with
effectiveness assessed based on changes in the fair value of the
underlying debt, using incremental borrowing rates currently available
on loans with similar terms and maturities. Effective gains and losses
on these derivatives and the underlying hedged items are recorded as
interest expense.

The following table indicates
the types of swaps used to hedge various assets and liabilities, and
their weighted average interest rates. Average variable rates are based
on rates as of the end of the reporting period. The swap contracts
mature during time periods ranging from 2004 to
2014.

DEBT

NOTES PAYABLE
—

The components of notes payable and their
respective weighted average interest rates at the end of the periods
were as
follows:

See
Note Seven for a description of related interest-rate derivative
instruments.

To ensure availability of funds, we maintain
bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding short-term
borrowings. As of May 25, 2003, we had $2.2 billion in committed lines
and $221 million in uncommitted lines.


We have revolving credit agreements
expiring in January 2006 covering the fee-paid credit lines that
provide us with the ability to refinance short-term borrowings on a
long-term basis; accordingly, a portion of our notes payable has been
reclassified to long-term debt. The revolving credit agreements provide
for borrowings of up to $1.1
billion.

LONG-TERM DEBT
—

On September 18, 2002, we began a new
medium-term note program under our existing shelf registration
statement for the sale to individual investors of up to $750 million of
fixed-rate notes with maturities of nine months or more (“Core
Notes”). As of May 25, 2003, we had issued approximately $72
million of notes under the Core Notes program.

On
November 20, 2002, we sold $350 million of 3 7/8%
fixed-rate notes due November 30, 2007. Concurrent with that offering,
we sold $135 million of 3.901% fixed-rate notes due
November 30, 2007. Interest for both the 3 7/8% notes and
the 3.901% notes is payable semiannually on May 30 and
November 30, beginning May 30, 2003. After giving effect to the
issuance of these notes and the sale of notes under the Core Notes
program, approximately $4.0 billion remains available under our
existing shelf registration statement for future use, which includes
the unused portion of the Core Notes program.

On October
28, 2002, we completed a private placement of zero coupon convertible
debentures with a face value of approximately $2.23 billion for gross
proceeds of approximately $1.50 billion. The issue price of the
debentures was $671.65 for each $1,000 in face value, which represents
a yield to maturity of 2.00%. The debentures cannot be
called by General Mills for three years after issuance and will mature
in 20 years. Holders of the debentures can require the Company to
repurchase the notes on the third, fifth, tenth and fifteenth
anniversaries of the issuance. We have the option to pay the repurchase
price in cash or in stock. The debentures are convertible into General
Mills common stock at a rate of 13.0259 shares for each $1,000
debenture. This results in an initial conversion price of approximately
$51.56 per share and represents a premium of 25 percent over the
closing sale price of $41.25 per share on October 22, 2002. The
conversion price will increase with the accretion of the original issue
discount on the debentures. Generally, except upon the occurrence of
specified events, holders of the debentures are not entitled to
exercise their conversion rights until the Company’s stock price
is greater than a specified percentage (beginning at 125 percent and
declining by 0.25 percent each six months) of the accreted conversion
price per share.

In order to offset dilution to General
Mills’ shareholders from future conversion of the debentures, the
Company has purchased call options from Diageo plc on approximately 29
million shares that Diageo currently owns. The premiums paid for the
call options totaled $89 million. The options are exercisable in whole
or in part from time to time, subject to certain limitations, during a
three-year period from the date of the sale of the
debentures.

In anticipation of the Pillsbury acquisition
and other financing needs, we entered into interest rate swap contracts
during fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002 totaling $7.1 billion to attempt to
lock in our interest rate on associated debt. In September 2001, $100
million of these swaps expired. In connection with the $3.5 billion
notes offering in February 2002, we closed out $3.5 billion of these
swaps. A portion was settled for cash, and the remainder was
neutralized with offsetting swaps. The notional amount of swaps settled
for cash totaled $1.1 billion and the net cash payment was $13 million.
The notional amount of the swaps that were neutralized with offsetting
swaps totaled $2.4 billion. During fiscal 2003, we closed out $1.985
billion of swaps due to the $1.5 billion
convertible debentures offering in October 2002 and the $485 million of
notes offering in November 2002. All of these swaps had been designated
as cash flow hedges. Therefore, the mark-to-market value for these
swaps has been recorded in Other Comprehensive Income. The amount
currently recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ($371
million) will be reclassified to interest expense over the lives of the
swap contracts (ranging from three to ten years).


A summary of our long-term debt is as
follows:

See
Note Seven for a description of related interest-rate derivative
instruments.

The Company has guaranteed the debt of the
Employee Stock Ownership Plan; therefore, the loan is reflected on our
consolidated balance sheets as long-term debt with a related offset in
Unearned Compensation in Stockholders’ Equity.

The
sinking fund and principal payments due on long-term debt are (in
millions) $105, $228, $57, $1,537 and $587 in fiscal 2004, 2005, 2006,
2007 and 2008, respectively. The fiscal 2005 and 2006 amounts are
exclusive of $7 million and $4 million, respectively, of interest yet
to be accreted on zero coupon notes. The notes payable that are
reclassified under our revolving credit agreement are not included in
these principal payments.

9.
MINORITY INTERESTS

In April 2002, the Company and
certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries contributed assets with an
aggregate fair market value of approximately $4 billion to another
wholly owned subsidiary, General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC), a limited
liability company. GMC is a separate and distinct legal entity from the
Company and its subsidiaries, and has separate assets, liabilities,
businesses and operations. The contributed assets consist primarily of
manufacturing assets and intellectual property associated with the
production and retail sale of Big G ready-to-eat cereals,

Progresso

soups and

Old El Paso

products. In
exchange for the contribution of these assets, GMC issued the managing
membership interest and Class A and Class B preferred membership
interests to wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The managing
member directs the business activities and operations of GMC and has
fiduciary responsibilities to GMC and its members. Other than rights to
vote on certain matters, holders of the Class A and Class B interests
have no right to direct the management of GMC.

In
May 2002, GMC sold approximately 30 percent of the Class A interests to
an unrelated third-party investor in exchange for $150 million. The
Class A interests receive quarterly preferred distributions at a
floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 90 basis points. The
GMC limited liability company agreement requires that the rate of the
preferred distributions for the Class A interests be reset by agreement
between the third-party investors and GMC every five years, beginning
in May 2007. If GMC and the investors fail to mutually agree on a new
rate of preferred distributions, GMC must remarket the securities. Upon
a failed remarketing, the rate over LIBOR will be increased by 75 basis
points (up to a maximum total of 300 basis points following a scheduled
reset date). In the event of four consecutive failed remarketings, the
third-party investors can force a liquidation and winding up of
GMC.


GMC has a scheduled duration of 20
years. However, GMC, through the managing member, may elect to redeem
all of the Class A interests held by third-party
investors at any time for an amount equal to the investors’
capital accounts, plus an optional retirement premium if such
retirement occurs prior to June 2007. Under certain circumstances, GMC
also may be dissolved and liquidated earlier. Events requiring
liquidation include, without limitation, the bankruptcy of GMC or its
subsidiaries, failure to deliver the preferred quarterly return,
failure to comply with portfolio requirements, breaches of certain
covenants, and four consecutive failed attempts to remarket the Class A
interests. In the event of a liquidation of GMC, the third-party
investors that hold the Class A interests would be entitled to
repayment from the proceeds of liquidation prior to the subsidiaries of
the Company that are members of GMC. The managing member may avoid
liquidation in most circumstances by exercising an option to purchase
the preferred interests. An election to redeem the preferred membership
interests could impact the Company’s liquidity by requiring the
Company to refinance the redemption price or liquidate a portion of GMC
assets.

Currently, all of the Class B interests are held by
a subsidiary of the Company. The Company may offer the Class B
interests and the remaining, unsold Class A interests to third-party
investors on terms and conditions to be determined.

For
financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of
operations, and cash flows of GMC are included in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. The third-party investor’s
Class A interest in GMC is reflected as a minority interest on the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company, and the return to the
third-party investor is reflected as interest expense in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

In fiscal 2003,
General Mills Capital, Inc. (GM Capital), a wholly owned subsidiary,
sold $150 million of its Series A preferred stock to an unrelated
third-party investor. GM Capital regularly enters into transactions
with the Company to purchase receivables of the Company. These
receivables are included in the consolidated balance sheet and the $150
million purchase price for the Series A preferred stock is reflected as
minority interest on the balance sheet. The proceeds from the issuance
of the preferred stock were used to reduce short-term debt. The return
to the third-party investor is reflected as interest expense in the
Consolidated Statements of
Earnings.

10.
STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Cumulative preference
stock of 5 million shares, without par value, is authorized but
unissued.

We have a shareholder rights plan that
entitles each outstanding share of common stock to one right. Each
right entitles the holder to purchase one two-hundredths of a share of
cumulative preference stock (or, in certain circumstances, common stock
or other securities), exercisable upon the occurrence of certain
events. The rights are not transferable apart from the common stock
until a person or group has acquired 20 percent or more, or makes a
tender offer for 20 percent or more, of the common stock. Then each
right will entitle the holder (other than the acquirer) to receive,
upon exercise, common stock of either the Company or the acquiring
company having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of
the right. The initial exercise price is $120 per right. The rights are
redeemable by the Board of Directors at any time prior to the
acquisition of 20 percent or more of the outstanding common stock. The
shareholder rights plan has been specifically amended so that the
Pillsbury transaction described in Note Two does not trigger the
exercisability of the rights. The rights expire on February 1, 2006. At
May 25, 2003, there were 370 million rights issued and
outstanding.

The Board of Directors has authorized the
repurchase, from time to time, of common stock for our treasury,
provided that the number of treasury shares shall not exceed 170
million.

Through private transactions in fiscal 2003 and
2002 that were a part of our stock repurchase program, we issued put
options and purchased call options related to our common stock. In
fiscal 2003 and 2002, we issued put options for less than 1 million and
7 million shares for $1 million and $17 million in premiums paid to the
Company, respectively. As of May 25, 2003, put options for less than 1
million shares remained outstanding at an exercise price of $42.50 per
share with an exercise date of May 30, 2003. In fiscal 2003 and 2002,
we purchased call options for 29 million and 4 million shares for $89
million and $16 million in premiums paid by the Company, respectively.
As of May 25, 2003, call options for 31 million shares remained
outstanding at exercise prices ranging from $48.15 to $54.84 per share
with exercise dates from June 2, 2003, to October 28, 2005. See Note
Eight for a description of call options purchased from Diageo plc in
fiscal 2003 in connection with the issuance of zero coupon convertible
debentures.

STOCK PLANS

The Company uses broad-based stock plans
to help ensure alignment with stockholders’ interests. A total of
1,835,709 shares are available for grant under the 1998 senior
management plan through October 1, 2005, the 1998 employee plan (which
has no specified duration) and the 2001 director plan through September
30, 2006. Shares available for grant are reduced by shares issued, net
of shares surrendered to the Company in stock-for-stock exercises.
Options may be priced only at 100 percent of the


fair market value at the date of grant. No
options now outstanding have been re-priced since the original date of
grant. Options now outstanding include some granted under the 1988,
1990, 1993 and 1995 option plans, under which no further rights may be
granted. All options expire within 10 years and one month after the
date of grant. The stock plans provide for full vesting of options upon
completion of specified service periods, or in the event there is a
change of control.

Stock subject to a restricted
period and a purchase price, if any (as determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors), may be granted to key employees
under the 1998 employee plan. Restricted stock, up to 50 percent of the
value of an individual’s cash incentive award, may be granted
through the Executive Incentive Plan. Certain restricted stock awards
require the employee to deposit personally owned shares (on a
one-for-one basis) with the Company during the restricted period. The
2001 director plan allows each nonemployee director to annually receive
1,000 restricted stock units convertible to common stock at a date of
the director’s choosing following his or her one-year term. In
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, grants of 345,889, 691,115 and 353,500
shares of restricted stock or units were made to employees and
directors with weighted average values at grant of $44.13, $46.93 and
$37.61 per share, respectively. On May 25, 2003, a total of 1,613,598
restricted shares and units were outstanding under all
plans.

The following table contains information on stock
option activity. Nearly 30 percent of the options outstanding at May
25, 2003, were granted under the Salary Replacement Option and Deposit
Stock Option Plans, both of which have been
discontinued.

SFAS
No. 123 allows either a fair value based method or an intrinsic value
based method of accounting for stock-based compensation plans. We use
the intrinsic value based method. Stock-based compensation expense
related to restricted stock for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $21
million, $16 million and $11 million, respectively. Stock-based
compensation expense for stock


options is not reflected in net earnings, as
all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to
the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the
grant. See Note One (L) for additional
details.

12. EARNINGS PER
SHARE

Basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) were
calculated using the
following:

The
diluted EPS calculation does not include 13 million, 4 million and 8
million average anti-dilutive stock options, nor does it include 3
million, 13 million and 15 million average anti-dilutive put options in
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

14. RETIREMENT
AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

We have
defined-benefit retirement plans covering most employees. Benefits for
salaried employees are based on length of service and final average
compensation. The hourly plans include various monthly amounts for each
year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the
requirements of federal law. Our principal retirement plan covering
salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would
vest in plan participants if the plan is terminated within five years
of a change in control.

We sponsor plans that
provide health-care benefits to the majority of our retirees. The
salaried health-care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree
contributions based on years of service. We fund related trusts for
certain employees and retirees on an annual basis.

Trust
assets related to the above plans consist principally of listed equity
securities, corporate obligations and U.S.
government securities.


Reconciliation of the funded
status of these plans and the amounts included in the balance sheet are

Effective
with fiscal 2004, we have changed our rate of return assumptions for
pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to 9.6 percent. This
rate will be used in determining our fiscal 2004 pension and
postretirement benefit income or expense.

The annual
increase in cost of postretirement benefits is assumed to decrease
gradually in future years, reaching an ultimate rate of 5.2 percent in
fiscal 2008.

Components of net benefit (income) or expense
each fiscal year are as
follows:

Assumed trend rates for
health-care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for
the postretirement benefit plans. If the health-care cost trend rate
increased by 1 percentage point in each future
year, the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of
postretirement expense would increase for fiscal 2003 by $6 million,
and the postretirement accumulated benefit
obligation as of May 25, 2003, would increase by $77 million. If the
health-care cost trend rate decreased by 1
percentage point in each future year, the aggregate of the
service and interest cost components of postretirement expense would
decrease for fiscal 2003 by $5 million, and the postretirement
accumulated benefit obligation as of May 25, 2003, would decrease by
$68 million.

Certain international operations have
defined-benefit pension plans that are not presented in the tables
above. These international operations have
prepaid pension assets of less than $1 million and accrued pension plan
liabilities of $4 million as of the end of fiscal 2003; pension expense
associated with these plans for fiscal 2003 was $3
million.

The Company’s total expense related to
defined-contribution plans recognized in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was
$30 million, $9 million and $8 million, respectively. The General Mills
Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that covers salaried and
nonunion employees. It had net assets of $1,597 million as of May 25,
2003, and $1,666 million as of May 26, 2002. This plan is a 401(k)
savings plan that includes a number of investment funds and an Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). The ESOP’s only assets are Company
common stock and temporary cash balances. The ESOP’s share of the
total defined contribution expense was $26 million, $3 million and $7
million, respectively. The ESOP’s expense is calculated by the
“shares allocated” method.

The ESOP uses
Company common stock to convey benefits to employees and, through
increased stock ownership, to further align employee interests with
those of shareholders. The Company matches a percentage of employee
contributions to the ESOP with a base match plus a variable year-end
match that depends on annual results. Employees receive the Company
match in the form of common stock.


The ESOP originally purchased Company
common stock principally with funds borrowed from third parties (and
guaranteed by the Company). The ESOP shares are included in net shares
outstanding for the purposes of calculating earnings per share. The
ESOP’s third-party debt is described in Note
Eight.

The Company treats cash dividends paid to the ESOP
the same as other dividends. Dividends received on leveraged shares
(i.e., all shares originally purchased with the debt proceeds) are used
for debt service, while dividends received on unleveraged shares are
passed through to participants.

The Company’s cash
contribution to the ESOP is calculated so as to pay off enough debt to
release sufficient shares to make the Company match. The ESOP uses the
Company’s cash contributions to the plan, plus the dividends
received on the ESOP’s leveraged shares, to make principal and
interest payments on the ESOP’s debt. As loan payments are made,
shares become unencumbered by debt and are committed to be allocated.
The ESOP allocates shares to individual employee accounts on the basis
of the match of employee payroll savings (contributions), plus
reinvested dividends received on previously allocated shares. In fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001, the ESOP incurred interest expense of $1 million,
$2 million and $3 million, respectively. The ESOP used dividends of $6
million, $8 million and $7 million, along with Company contributions of
$26 million, $3 million and $6 million to make interest and principal
payments in the respective years.

The number of
shares of Company common stock in the ESOP is summarized as
follows:

PROFIT-SHARING PLAN

The Executive Incentive Plan
provides incentives to key employees who have the greatest potential to
contribute to current earnings and successful future operations. All
employees at the level of vice president and above participate in the
plan. These awards are approved by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors, which consists solely of independent, outside
directors. Awards are based on performance against pre-established
goals approved by the Committee. Profit-sharing expense was $19
million, $11 million and $12 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.


16.
INCOME TAXES

The components of earnings before income
taxes and earnings of joint ventures and the corresponding income taxes
thereon are as
follows:

In
fiscal 2003, we paid income taxes of $248 million and received a $109
million refund of fiscal 2002 tax overpayments. During fiscal 2002 and
2001, we paid income taxes of $196 million and $231 million,
respectively.

In fiscal 1982 and 1983 we purchased certain
income tax items from other companies through tax lease transactions.
Total current income taxes charged to earnings reflect the amounts
attributable to operations and have not been materially affected by
these tax leases. Actual current taxes payable relating to fiscal 2003,
2002 and 2001 operations were increased by approximately $4 million, $3
million and $16 million, respectively, due to the current effect of tax
leases. These tax payments do not affect taxes for statement of
earnings purposes since they repay tax benefits realized in prior
years.

The following table reconciles the U.S. statutory
income tax rate with the effective income tax
rate:


The tax effects of temporary
differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities are
as
follows:

Of
the total valuation allowance, $781 million relates to a deferred tax
asset for unrealized capital or related losses recorded as part of the
Pillsbury acquisition. In the future, if tax benefits are realized
related to these losses, the reduction in the valuation allowance will
be allocated to reduce goodwill.

We have not recognized a
deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of $444 million from our
foreign operations because we do not expect those earnings to become
taxable to us in the foreseeable future and because a determination of
the potential liability is not practicable. If a portion were to be
remitted, we believe income tax credits would substantially offset any
resulting tax liability.

We have capital loss carryforwards
of approximately $290 million which will expire in
2007.

Some
leases require payment of property taxes, insurance and maintenance
costs in addition to the rent payments. Contingent and escalation rent
in excess of minimum rent payments and sublease income netted in rent
expense were insignificant.

Noncancelable future lease
commitments (in millions) are: $69 in fiscal 2004, $63 in fiscal 2005,
$54 in fiscal 2006, $50 in fiscal 2007, $46 in fiscal 2008 and $172
after fiscal 2008, with a cumulative total of $454. These future lease
commitments will be partially offset by future sublease receipts of $46
million.

We are contingently liable under guarantees and
comfort letters for $172 million. The guarantees and comfort letters
are principally issued to support borrowing arrangements, primarily for
our joint ventures.


The Company is involved in various
claims, including environmental matters, arising in the ordinary course
of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of
these matters, either individually or in aggregate, will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

18.
BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We
operate exclusively in the consumer foods industry, with multiple
operating segments organized generally by product
categories.

Following the acquisition of Pillsbury,
we restructured our management organization. Consistent with our new
organization and SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information,” we have aggregated our
operating segments into three reportable segments: 1) U.S. Retail; 2)
Bakeries and Foodservice; and 3) International. The U.S. Retail segment
consists of cereals, meals, refrigerated and frozen dough products,
baking products, snacks, yogurt and other. Our Bakeries and Foodservice
segment consists of products marketed to bakeries and offered to the
commercial and noncommercial foodservice sectors throughout the United
States and Canada. The International segment includes our retail
business outside the United States and our foodservice business outside
of the United States and Canada. At the beginning of fiscal 2003, the
Lloyd’s foodservice and the bakery flour businesses were
realigned from the U.S. Retail segment to the Bakeries and Foodservice
segment. All prior year amounts are restated for comparative
purposes.

During fiscal 2003, one customer, Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 13 percent of the
Company’s consolidated net sales and 17 percent of the
Company’s sales in the U.S. Retail segment. No other customer
accounted for 10 percent or more of the Company’s consolidated
net sales. In the U. S. Retail and Bakeries and Foodservice segments,
the top five customers accounted for approximately 43 percent and 35
percent of fiscal 2003 net sales, respectively.

Management
reviews operating results to evaluate segment performance. Operating
profit for the reportable segments excludes general corporate items,
and restructuring and other exit costs. Interest expense and income
taxes are centrally managed at the corporate level and, therefore, are
not allocated to segments since they are excluded from the measure of
segment profitability reviewed by the Company’s management. Under
our supply chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse,
distribution and sales activities are substantially integrated across
our operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a
result, fixed assets, capital expenditures for long-lived assets, and
depreciation and amortization expenses are not maintained nor available
by operating segment.


The measurement of operating
segment results is generally consistent with the presentation of the
consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany transactions between
reportable operating segments were not material in the periods
presented.

table provides net sales information for our primary product
categories:

require disclosure
here.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures.

The
Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
May 25, 2003 to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and
forms.

There were no changes in the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s
fiscal fourth quarter ended May 25, 2003 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.
