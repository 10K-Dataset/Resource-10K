                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

     General Mills,  Inc. was  incorporated  in Delaware in 1928. The Company is
engaged in the manufacture  and marketing of consumer foods products.  The terms
"General  Mills,"  "Company" and "Registrant"  mean General Mills,  Inc. and its
subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.

    The Company is a leading producer of packaged consumer foods and markets its
products primarily through its own sales organizations, supported by advertising
and other  promotional  activities.  Such  products  are  primarily  distributed
directly to retail food chains, cooperatives, membership stores and wholesalers.
Certain food  products,  such as yogurt and some  foodservice  and  refrigerated
products, are sold through distributors and brokers.

    The packaged  consumer  foods market is highly  competitive,  with  numerous
competitors  of varying  sizes.  The principal  methods of  competition  include
product quality, advertising,  promotion and price. In most of its consumer food
lines,  described  below,  General  Mills  competes  not only with other  widely
advertised  branded  products,  but also with generic products and private label
products, which are generally sold at lower prices.

    CEREALS.  General Mills produces and sells a number of ready-to-eat cereals,
including such brands as: CHEERIOS, HONEY NUT CHEERIOS,  FROSTED CHEERIOS, APPLE
CINNAMON CHEERIOS,  MULTI-GRAIN CHEERIOS, TEAM CHEERIOS, WHEATIES, HONEY FROSTED

NesQuik, a chocolate-flavored cereal.

    DESSERTS,  FLOUR AND BAKING  MIXES.  General Mills makes and sells a line of

cakes, RICH & CREAMY and SOFT WHIPPED ready-to-spread frostings, SUPREME brownie
and  dessert  bar mixes,  muffin  mixes,  STIR 'N BAKE  mixes and SWEET  REWARDS
fat-free and  reduced-fat  mixes.  The company markets a variety of baking mixes
under the BISQUICK  trademark,  sells pouch mixes under the BETTY  CROCKER name,
and produces  family flour under the GOLD MEDAL brand,  introduced in 1880,  and
regional  brands  such as LA PINA,  ROBIN HOOD and RED BAND.  The  Company  also
engages  in  grain   merchandising,   produces  flour  for  internal  ingredient
requirements and sells flour to bakery, foodservice and manufacturing markets.

    DINNER AND SIDE DISH  PRODUCTS.  General Mills  manufactures a line of BETTY
CROCKER dry packaged  dinner mixes under the HAMBURGER  HELPER,  TUNA HELPER and
CHICKEN HELPER trademarks and a line of refrigerated barbeque products under the
LLOYD'S BARBEQUE name. Also under the BETTY CROCKER trademark, the Company sells
dry packaged specialty potatoes,  POTATO BUDS instant mashed potatoes,  seasoned
rice and pasta side  dishes,  SUDDENLY  SALAD and  BAC*O'S  salad  topping.  The
Company also  manufactures  and markets  seasoned rice and pasta side dish mixes
under the FARMHOUSE name.

    SNACK PRODUCTS AND  BEVERAGES.  General Mills markets  POP*SECRET  microwave

and GOLDEN GRAHAMS  TREATS;  a line of fruit snacks  including  FRUIT  ROLL-UPS,
FRUIT BY THE FOOT, GUSHERS,  FRUIT STRING THING, LUCKY CHARMS and TRIX shapes, a
line of salty snack  products  called CHEX Mix and savory snacks  marketed under
the name BUGLES.  The Company also  produces and sells a line of  single-serving
fruit juice drinks  marketed  under the SQUEEZIT  trademark  and SQUEEZIT 100, a
100% juice beverage.

    YOGURT  PRODUCTS.  General  Mills  manufactures  and sells yogurt  products,
including  YOPLAIT  ORIGINAL,  YOPLAIT LIGHT,  CUSTARD STYLE and TRIX, a layered
yogurt for children. GO-GURT, yogurt packaged in a portable tube, was introduced
in fiscal 1999 and is expanding  nationally.  The Company also  manufactures and
sells a variety of  refrigerated  cup yogurt  products  under the COLOMBO  brand
name.

    FOODSERVICE.  General Mills markets branded baking mixes,  cereals,  snacks,

custom  products  to the  commercial  and  non-commercial  foodservice  sectors,

convenience stores and vending.

    INTERNATIONAL FOODS OPERATIONS.  The International Foods organization of the
Company  exports  packaged food products and snack pellets  throughout the world
and  licenses  food  products  for  manufacture  in Europe and the  Asia/Pacific
region.  General Mills Canada,  Inc.  sells BIG G  ready-to-eat  cereals,  BETTY
CROCKER side dishes, baking and packaged dinner mixes and fruit, grain and salty
snacks in Canada.

    During fiscal 1999 the Company engaged in four international joint ventures.
See Note Four to Consolidated  Financial  Statements appearing on page 28 of the
Company's 1999 Annual Report to Stockholders,  incorporated herein by reference.

equity interest in CPW.

    Snack Ventures Europe (SVE), the Company's joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc.,
manufactures and sells snack foods in Holland, France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal,
Greece,  Estonia,  Hungary,  Russia and Slovakia. The Company has a 40.5% equity
interest in SVE.

    In  fiscal  1999,  decisions  were made to end the  Company's  International
Dessert  Partners  joint venture with Bestfoods for baking mixes and desserts in
Latin  America,  and the Tong Want snack joint  venture with Want Want  Holdings
Ltd.,  which  had not yet  begun  operating.  These  decisions  will  not have a
material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

General Information
    TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS. The Company's products are marketed under trademarks
and service  marks owned by or licensed to the Company.  Trademarks  and service
marks are vital to the Company's business.  The most significant  trademarks and
service marks of the Company are contained in the business discussions above.

    The Company  considers that,  taken as a whole, the rights under its various
patents,  which expire from time to time, are a valuable asset,  but the Company
does not believe that its businesses  are  materially  dependent upon any single
patent or group of related patents.  Outside its joint venture  activities,  the
Company's  activities  under licenses or other franchises or concessions are not
material.

    RAW  MATERIALS AND  SUPPLIES.  The  principal raw materials  used by General
Mills are cereal grains, sugar, fruits, other agricultural  products,  vegetable
oils, and plastic and paper for packaging materials.  Although General Mills has
some  long-term  contracts,  the majority of such raw materials are purchased on
the open market.  Prices of most raw materials  will probably  increase over the
long term. Nonetheless, General Mills believes that it will be able to obtain an
adequate supply of needed ingredients and packaging materials.  Occasionally and
where possible,  General Mills makes advance  purchases of items  significant to
its  business  in  order to  ensure  continuity  of  operations.  The  Company's
objective is to procure  materials  meeting both the company's quality standards
and its production needs at the lowest total cost to the Company.  The Company's
strategy is to buy these  materials at price levels that allow a targeted profit
margin.  Since  commodities  generally  represent  the largest  variable cost in
manufacturing the Company's products, to the extent possible, the Company hedges
the risk associated with adverse price movements using  exchange-traded  futures
and options,  forward cash contracts and  over-the-counter  hedging  mechanisms.
These tools enable the Company to manage the related  commodity  price risk over
periods of time that exceed the period of time in which the  physical  commodity
is  available.  Accordingly,  the Company  uses  hedging to  mitigate  the risks
associated with adverse price movements and not to speculate in the marketplace.
See also Note Seven to Consolidated  Financial  Statements appearing on pages 29
through 31 of the  Company's  1999 Annual Report to  Stockholders,  incorporated
herein by  reference  and the "Market Risk  Management"  section of the Report's
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis"  appearing on page 19 of the Company's
1999 Annual Report to Stockholders, incorporated herein by reference.

    CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES.  During the three  fiscal  years ended May 30,  1999,
General Mills expended $627 million for capital expenditures,  not including the
cost of acquired  companies.  The Company  expects to spend  approximately  $250
million for such purposes in fiscal 2000.

    RESEARCH AND  DEVELOPMENT.  The  Company's  main  research  and  development
facilities are located at the James Ford Bell Technical  Center in  Minneapolis,
Minnesota. With a staff of approximately 880, the Center is responsible for most
of the food research for the Company.  Approximately  one-half of the staff hold
degrees in various chemical,  biological and engineering sciences.  Research and
development  expenditures (all  Company-sponsored)  amounted to $70.0 million in
fiscal  1999,  $66.3  million in fiscal 1998 and $61.4  million in fiscal  1997.
General  Mills'  research and  development  resources are focused on new product
development, product improvement, process design and improvement,  packaging and
exploratory research in new business areas.

    EMPLOYEES.    At  May 30, 1999,  General  Mills  had  approximately  10,660
employees.

    ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. As of June 30, 1999, the Company has received notices
advising  that there have been  releases or  threatened  releases  of  hazardous
substances or wastes at 11 sites,  and alleging that the Company and other named
parties are  potentially  responsible  for cleaning up those sites and/or paying
certain costs in connection  with those sites.  These  matters  involve  several
different  procedural  contexts,  including litigation initiated by governmental
authorities  and/or private  parties,  administrative  proceedings  commenced by
regulatory  agencies,  and demand letters issued by regulatory  agencies  and/or
private parties. The Company recognizes that its potential exposure with respect
to any of these  sites  may be joint and  several,  but has  concluded  that its
probable  aggregate  exposure is not  material.  This  conclusion is based upon,
among other things,  the Company's payments and/or accruals with respect to each
site;  the  number,   ranking,  and  financial  strength  of  other  potentially
responsible  parties  identified  at  each  of  the  sites;  the  status  of the
proceedings,  including various settlement agreements,  consent decrees or court
orders;  allocations  of  volumetric  waste  contributions  and  allocations  of
relative  responsibility  among  potentially  responsible  parties  developed by
regulatory agencies and by private parties;  remediation cost estimates prepared
by governmental authorities or private technical consultants;  and the Company's
historical  experience  in  negotiating  and settling  disputes  with respect to
similar sites.

    Based on  current  facts and  circumstances,  General  Mills  believes  that
neither the results of these  proceedings  nor its  compliance  in general  with
environmental  laws or regulations  will have a material adverse effect upon the
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING  INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF
"SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
     The Company and its  representatives  may from time to time make written or
oral forward-looking statements with respect to annual or long-term goals of the
Company,  including  statements  contained  in the  Company's  filings  with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and in its reports to stockholders.

     The words or  phrases  "will  likely  result,"  "are  expected  to,"  "will
continue,"  "is  anticipated,"  "estimate,"  "project"  or  similar  expressions
identify  "forward-looking   statements"  within  the  meaning  of  the  Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain
risks and  uncertainties  that could cause actual  results to differ  materially
from  historical  earnings and those  presently  anticipated  or projected.  The
Company  wishes to  caution  readers  not to place  undue  reliance  on any such
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.

     In connection with the "safe harbor"  provisions of the Private  Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is identifying important factors that
could affect the Company's  financial  performance and could cause the Company's
actual  results for future  periods to differ  materially  from any  opinions or
statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements.

     Our future  results  could be  affected  by a variety  of  factors  such as
competitive dynamics in the U.S.  ready-to-eat cereal market,  including pricing
and  promotional  spending  levels  by  premium  branded  manufacturers  and  by
lower-priced bagged cereal and private label competitors.  Results could also be
affected by other external factors such as: economic  conditions;  the impact of
competitive products and pricing;  product  development;  actions of competitors
other  than as  described  above;  changes  in laws and  regulations,  including
changes in accounting standards;  customer demand;  effectiveness of advertising
and  marketing  spending or  programs;  consumer  perception  of  health-related
issues; fluctuations in the cost and availability of supply-chain resources; and
foreign economic conditions, including currency rate fluctuations.

     The Company's debt securities are rated by rating organizations.  Investors
should note that a security rating is not a recommendation  to buy, sell or hold
securities,  that it is subject to  revision  or  withdrawal  at any time by the
assigning rating agency, and that each rating should be evaluated  independently
of any other rating.

     The Company  specifically  declines to undertake any obligation to publicly
revise any  forward-looking  statements that have been made to reflect events or
circumstances  after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of
anticipated or unanticipated events.

The Stockholders and the Board of Directors
General Mills, Inc.:

    Under date of June 28, 1999, we reported on the consolidated  balance sheets
of General Mills,  Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 30, 1999 and May 31, 1998 and
the related consolidated  statements of earnings,  stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year  period ended May 30, 1999,
as  contained  in the 1999 annual  report to  stockholders.  These  consolidated
financial statements and our report thereon are incorporated by reference in the
annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 30, 1999. In connection
with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we have
also  audited  the  related  financial  statement  schedule  as  listed  in  the
accompanying  index. This financial  statement schedule is the responsibility of
the Company's  management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on this
