The Company was incorporated in the State of Washington in May 1979. Its executive offices are located at 1015 Third Avenue, 12th Floor, Seattle, Washington, and its telephone
number is (206) 674-3400.

For
information concerning the amount of revenues, net revenues, operating income, identifiable assets, capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization attributable to the
geographic areas in which the Company conducts its business, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Beginning
in 1981, the Company's primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from the Far East to the United States and related customs brokerage and import services. In the
mid-1980's, the Company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight, ocean freight and distribution services. Today the Company offers a complete range of global logistics services
to a diversified group of customers, both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location. As opportunities for profitable growth arise, the Company plans to create new offices. While the
Company has historically expanded through organic growth, the Company has also been open to growth through acquisition of, or establishing joint ventures with, existing agents or others within the
industry.

Airfreight Services

Airfreight services accounted for approximately 41 percent of the Company's 2000, 1999, and 1998 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses
("net revenues"), respectively. When performing airfreight services, the Company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment. When acting
as a freight consolidator, the Company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from
airlines. When moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation, the Company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which
carries the shipment. Whether acting as an agent or consolidator, the Company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing, familiarity with local business practices, knowledge of export and
import documentation and procedures, the ability to arrange for ancillary services, and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand.

In
its airfreight forwarding operations, the Company procures shipments from its customers, determines the routing, consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution
point, and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point. At the distribution point, the Company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component
shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations.

The
Company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3,500 to 4,500 pounds and includes merchandise from several shippers. Because shipment by air is
relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation, air shipments are generally characterized by a high value-to-weight ratio, the need for rapid delivery, or both.

The
Company typically delivers shipments from a Company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or on to pallets. Shipments normally
arrive at the destination distribution point within forty-eight hours after such delivery. During peak shipment periods, cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and
backlogs of freight shipments may occur. When these conditions exist, the Company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand.

The
Company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in cost-effective combinations. Typically, as the weight or volume of a shipment increases,
the cost per pound/kilo or cubic inch/centimeter charged by the Company decreases. The rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the
shipment increases. As a result, by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment, the Company


is able to obtain a lower rate per pound/kilo or cubic inch/centimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment, while generally offering the customer a lower rate than
could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment.

The
Company's net airfreight forwarding revenues from a consolidated shipment includes the differential between the rate charged to the Company by an airline and the rate which the
Company charges to its customers, commissions paid to the Company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services. Such ancillary services provided by the Company include
preparation of shipping and customs documentation, packing, crating and insurance services, negotiation of letters of credit, and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws. When
the Company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment, its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the
customer.

The
Company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so. Management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the Company to undue business risks, including large
capital outlays, increased fixed operating expenses, problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines. Because the Company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments,
changes in carrier policies and practices such as pricing, payment terms, scheduling, and frequency of service may affect its business.

The
Company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments.
Breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from non-exclusive agents for airfreight shipments.

Customs Brokerage and Import Services

Customs brokerage and import services accounted for approximately 38, 39, and 40 percent of the Company's 2000, 1999, and 1998 consolidated net revenues,
respectively. As a customs broker, the Company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of
the importer, arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies, and arranging for delivery. The Company also provides other services at destination including temporary warehousing,
inland transportation, inventory manipulation and management, cargo insurance and product distribution.

The
Company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder. However, substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived
from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder. Conversely, shipments handled by the Company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer.

The
Company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the United States, Canada and/or Mexico. The commodities being cleared and the time sensitive
nature of the border brokerage business required the Company to make significant modifications to its systems and traditional office structure in order to provide competitive service.

During
1996 the Company established a subsidiary, Expeditors Tradewin, L.L.C., to respond to customer driven requests for high-end customs consulting services. The demand for these
services was stimulated by the changes made by the U.S. Customs Service in response to the 1993 Customs Modernization Act. Fees for these non-transactional services are based upon hourly billing rates
and bids for mutually agreed procedures.

There
is currently a noticeable trend, prompted by customer demand, to quote rates on a door-to-door basis. Management foresees the potential, in the medium to long-term, for fees
normally associated with customs clearance to be de-emphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the Company.


Ocean Freight Services

Ocean freight services accounted for approximately 21, 20, and 19 percent of the Company's 2000, 1999, and 1998 consolidated net revenues, respectively. The
Company's revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the Company may provide, such
as preparing documentation, procuring insurance, arranging for packing and crating services, and providing consultation. The Company operates Expeditors International Ocean ("EIO"), a Non-Vessel
Operating Common Carrier ("NVOCC") specializing in ocean freight consolidation from the Far East to the United States. EIO also provides service, on a smaller scale, to and from any location where the
Company has an office or agent. As an NVOCC, EIO contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at
an agreed rate. EIO solicits less than container load ("LCL") freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines. EIO also handles full container
loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers. The Company does not own vessels and generally does not
physically handle the cargo.

Expeditors
Cargo Management Systems ("ECMS") supplies a sophisticated ocean consolidation service. The Company owns and maintains software that allows it to sell ECMS to large volume
customers that have signed their own service contracts with the ocean carriers. As an ocean consolidator, ECMS may obtain LCL freight from several vendors and consolidate this cargo into full
containers. The Company's revenues as an ocean consolidator are derived from handling LCL cargo at origin and from the fees paid by customers for access to data captured during the consolidation
process.

Marketing and Customers

The Company provides flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate destinations. Although the domestic
importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required, the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process. Therefore, the Company coordinates its
marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers.

The
Company's marketing efforts are focused primarily on the traffic, shipping and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers. The district manager of each office is
responsible for
marketing, sales coordination, and implementation in the area in which he or she is located. All employees are responsible for customer service and relations.

The
Company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global
logistics. Marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the Company's services directly to local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection of the
logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service. The Company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers, its
emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities, and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success.

The
goods handled by the Company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination. Shipments of computer
components, other electronic equipment, housewares, sporting goods, machine parts, and toys, comprise a significant percentage of the Company's business. Typical import customers include computer
retailers and distributors of consumer electronics, department store chains, clothing and shoe wholesalers, manufacturers and catalogue stores. Historically, no single customer has accounted for five
percent or more of the Company's revenues.


Competition

The global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. There are a large number of companies
competing in one or more segments of the industry, but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited. Depending on the location of the
shipper and the importer, the Company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities. While there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into larger
firms striving for immediate multinational and multi-service networks, the regional and local competitors maintain a strong market presence.

Historically,
the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service, including reliability, responsiveness, expertise,
convenience, and scope of operations. The Company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry. Recently, larger customers have
exhibited a trend toward more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as just-in-time inventory management. This trend has
made computerized customer service capabilities a
significant factor in attracting and retaining customers. These computerized customer service capabilities include customized Electronic Data Interchange, ("EDI"), and on-line freight tracing and
tracking applications. The customized EDI applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers' systems and the Company's systems. Freight tracing and tracking applications allow
customers to know the location, transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit.

Management
believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers' increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the
ongoing success of the Company. Accordingly, the Company has devoted a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands.
Management believes that the Company's existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes.

Developing
these systems has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers. Small and middle-tier competitors, in general, do not have the resources
available to develop these customized systems. As a result, there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry. Management expects that this trend toward
consolidation will continue for the short to medium-term. Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the Company's competitors and typically involves
the purchase of significant "goodwill". As a result, the Company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions.

The
Company's ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential, if not the most important, element of
its ability to compete in the industry. To this end, the Company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch revenues or profits available to managers for distribution
among key personnel. The Company believes that these incentive compensation programs, combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts, provide it with a
distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have matched only through acquisition.

Currency and Other Risk Factors

The nature of the Company's worldwide operations necessitate the Company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. This results in the
Company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference. Many of the countries where the Company maintains offices and/or agency relationships
have strict currency control regulations which influence the Company's ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. The Company


tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices or agents.

In
addition, the Company's ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines, steamship lines
and governmental agencies. The Company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be good. However, changes in space allotments available from carriers, governmental
deregulation efforts, "modernization" of the regulations governing customs clearance, and/or changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the Company's business in unpredictable ways.

Seasonality

Historically, the Company's operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis. The first quarter has traditionally been
the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest. This pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays,
consumer demand, economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces. In addition, this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the
Company's international network and service offerings. The Company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors, nor can the Company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular
factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods.

A
significant portion of the Company's revenues are derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries
whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just-in-time production schedules. Therefore, the timing of the Company's revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of the Company's control,
such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays. Additionally, many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and
therefore, the Company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter. To the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts, any such
shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the Company's stock.

Environmental

In the United States, the Company is subject to Federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for
the protection of the environment. Similar laws apply in many foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with
these environmental laws, governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues, and the Company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business.
The Company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years.

Employees

At February 28, 2001, the Company employed approximately 7,611 people, 3,142 in the United States and 97 in the balance of North America, 491 in South
America, 1,166 in Europe, 1,915 in the Far East & Australasia, 659 in the Near/Middle East and 141 in Africa. Approximately 798 of the Company's employees are engaged principally in sales and
marketing and customer service, 5,045 in operations and 1,768 in finance and administration. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its
employees to be satisfactory.

In
order to retain the services of highly qualified, experienced, and motivated employees, the Company places considerable emphasis on its incentive compensation programs and stock
option plans.

Regulation

With respect to the Company's activities in the air transportation industry in the United States, it is subject to regulation by the Department of
Transportation ("DOT") as an indirect air carrier. The


Company's overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation. The Company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer
offices, has made application for a license, as an airfreight forwarder by the International Air Transport Association ("IATA"). IATA is a voluntary association of airlines which prescribes certain
operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members. The majority of the Company's airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are IATA members.

The
Company is licensed as a customs broker by the Customs Service of the Department of the Treasury in each U.S. customs district in which it does business. All U.S. customs brokers
are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by the Customs Service. In other jurisdictions in which the Company performs clearance services, the Company is licensed
by the appropriate governmental authority.

The
Company is registered as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary by the Federal Maritime Commission ("FMC"). The FMC has established certain qualifications for shipping agents,
including certain surety bonding requirements. The FMC also is responsible for the economic regulation of NVOCC activity originating or terminating in the United States. To comply with these economic
regulations, vessel operators and NVOCCs, such as EIO, are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the
U.S. The FMC has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties.

The
Company does not believe that current U.S. and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations. In general, the Company
conducts its business activities in each country through a majority owned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country. However, the regulations of foreign
governments can impose barriers to the Company's ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority U.S. owned subsidiary. For example, foreign ownership of a customs
brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding and/or freight consolidation is restricted to local entities.
When the Company encounters this sort of governmental restriction, it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the Company the
substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation. This can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a
qualified local entity that holds the required license. In cases where the Company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the local entity, notwithstanding the lack of technical
majority ownership of common stock, the Company consolidates the accounts of the local entity. In such cases, consolidation is necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of
operations of the Company because of the existence of the parent-subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting common stock.

Cargo Liability

When acting as an airfreight consolidator, the Company assumes a carrier's liability for lost or damaged shipments. This legal liability is typically limited
by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value ($9.07 per pound unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge), except if the loss or damage is caused by
willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate air waybill. The airline which the Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the Company in the same manner and to the
same extent. When acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper, the Company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline.

When
acting as an ocean freight consolidator, the Company assumes a carrier's liability for lost or damaged shipments. This liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of
the transaction value or the released value ($500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher


value and pays a surcharge). The steamship line which the Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the Company in the same manner and to the same extent. In its ocean
freight forwarding and customs clearance operations, the Company does not assume cargo liability.

When
providing warehouse and distribution services, the Company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or fifty
cents per pound with a maximum of fifty dollars per "lot" — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track. Upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse
and distribution services, the Company will assume additional liability.

The
Company maintains marine cargo insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable. The Company also maintains
insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in Company warehouse facilities.

ITEM 2—PROPERTIES

The Company owns a 214,000 square foot office building in downtown Seattle, a 150,000 square foot warehouse/industrial office facility in Nassau County, New
York, a 27,200 square foot office facility near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, an 80,000 square foot office and warehouse facility on a ten-acre parcel near O'Hare International Airport in
Chicago, a 5,500 square foot office facility in the Tsim Sha Tsui East district of Kowloon, Hong Kong, and a 10,900 square foot office facility in Taipei, Taiwan. The Company also owns a 23,400 square
foot office and warehouse facility on a long-term renewable land lease at the Brussels Cargo facility in Brussels, Belgium.

The
Company leases and maintains 59 additional offices and satellite locations in the United States and 118 offices throughout the world, each located close to an airport, ocean port,
or on an important border crossing. The majority of these facilities contain warehouse facilities. Lease terms are either on a month-to-month basis or terminate at various times through 2006. As an
office matures, the Company will investigate the possibility of building or buying suitable facilities. Lease payments currently aggregate approximately $2,177,000 per month. See Note 6 to the
Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that current leases can be extended and that suitable alternative facilities are available in the vicinity of each present facility
should extensions be unavailable at the conclusion of current leases.

ITEM 3—LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is ordinarily involved in claims and lawsuits which arise in the normal course of business, none of which currently, in management's opinion, will
have a significant effect on the Company's financial position.

SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS UNDER SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995; CERTAIN CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

From time to time, the Company or its representatives have made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward-looking statements
may be included in, but not limited to, press releases, oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer or in various filings made by the Company with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The words or phrases "will likely result", "are expected to", "will continue", "is anticipated", "estimate", "project" or similar expressions are intended to identify
"forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act. Such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to and are accompanied by the following discussion
of certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.

The
risks included here are not exhaustive. Furthermore, reference is also made to other sections of this report which include additional factors which could adversely impact the
Company's business and
financial performance. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict
all of such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all of such risk factors on the Company's business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements cannot be relied upon as a guarantee of actual results.

Shareholders
should be aware that while the Company does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against the Company's policy to disclose to such analysts any
material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that the Company agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst
irrespective of the content of such statement or report. Furthermore, the Company has a policy against issuing financial forecasts or projections or confirming the accuracy of forecasts or projections
issued by others. Accordingly, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of the Company.


RISK FACTORS

DISCUSSION AND POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE

International Trade

The Company primarily provides services to customers engaged in international commerce. Everything that affects international trade has the potential to expand or contract the Company's primary market. For
example, international trade is influenced by:

•

currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations;

•

changes in governmental policies;

•

changes in international and domestic customs regulations;

•

wars and other conflicts;

•

natural disasters;

•

changes in consumer attitudes regarding goods made in countries other than their own; and

•

changes in the price and readily available quantities of oil and other petroleum-related products.

Third Party Vendors

The Company is a non-asset based supplier of global logistics services. As a result, the Company depends on a variety of asset based third party vendors. The quality and profitability of the Company's services depend upon effective selection,
management and discipline of third party vendors.

Predictability of Results

The Company is not aware of any accurate means of forecasting short-term customer requirements. However, long-term customer satisfaction depends upon the Company's ability to meet these unpredictable short-term customer requirements. Personnel costs,
the Company's single largest variable expense, are always less flexible in the very near term as the Company must staff to meet uncertain demand. As a result, short-term operating results could be disproportionately effected.

Foreign Operations

The majority of the Company's revenues and operating income come from operations conducted outside the United States. To maintain a global service network, the Company may be required to operate in hostile locations.

Key Personnel

The Company is a service business. The quality of this service is directly related to the quality of the Company's employees. Identifying, training and retaining key employees is essential to continued growth and future profitability. Continued
loyalty to the Company will not be assured by contract.

Technology

Increasingly, the Company must compete based upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies utilized in performing its core businesses. Future results depend upon the Company's success in the cost effective development and integration of
communication and information systems technologies.

Growth

To date, the Company has relied primarily upon organic growth and has tended to avoid growth through acquisition. Future results will depend upon the Company's ability to continue to grow internally or to demonstrate the ability to successfully
identify and integrate non-dilutive acquisitions.


ITEM 7—MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto contained
elsewhere within this report.

Results of Operations

The following table shows the consolidated net revenues (revenues less transportation expenses) attributable to the Company's principal services and the
Company's expenses for 2000, 1999 and 1998, expressed as percentages of net revenues. With respect to the Company's services other than freight consolidation, net revenues are identical to revenues.
Management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the Company's principal services since total revenues earned by the Company as a freight
consolidator include the carriers' charges to the Company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the Company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned
by the Company.

2000 compared with 1999

Airfreight net revenues in 2000 increased 23% compared with 1999 primarily due to (1) increased airfreight shipments and tonnages handled by the Company
from the Far East to North America and Europe, (2) increased prices charged by the airlines which were passed along to customers, and (3) increased export airfreight shipments and
tonnages from North America and Europe. Airfreight margins expanded approximately 2% during 2000 as compared with 1999. Higher freight volumes and efficient consolidations of dense and fluffy
(volumetric) freight allowed the Company to maximize purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates to customers. The Company's North American export airfreight net revenues
increased 21% in 2000 compared to 1999. Airfreight net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 31% and 9%, respectively, for 2000 compared with 1999. Airfreight rates on Far East to North
American trade lanes, the Company's most dominant lane, remained strong throughout 2000.


Ocean freight net revenues increased 32% in 2000 compared to 1999. Ocean freight demand remained strong throughout 2000 and ocean freight rates from the Far East, the Company's
largest trade lane, increased in the last half of the year. During 2000, management continued to expand market share, increase ocean tonnage, and increase net ocean freight revenues while offering
competitive market rates to customers. Changes in the regulatory environment in the United States created new opportunities for the Company's NVOCC operations to provide services to customers who had
previously dealt directly with the ocean carriers. Margins remained nearly constant in 2000 as compared with 1999. Expeditors Cargo Management Systems (ECMS), a PC-based ocean freight consolidation
management and purchase order tracking service, continued to be instrumental in attracting new business. The Company's North American export ocean freight net revenues increased 26% in 2000 compared
to 1999. This increase was a result of the Company handling more ocean shipments moving from North America to the Far East and, to a lesser extent, from North America to Europe. Ocean freight net
revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 38% and 26%, respectively, for 2000 compared with 1999.

Customs
brokerage and import services revenues increased 21% in 2000 as compared with 1999 as a result of (1) the Company's growing reputation for providing high quality
service, (2) consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics
management program, and (3) the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and distinct service offered to existing and potential customers. Distribution services accounted for
nearly 22% of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for 2000 compared with 1999.

Salaries
and related costs increased in 2000 compared to 1999 as a result of (1) the Company's increased hiring of sales, operations, and administrative personnel in existing and new
offices to accommodate increases in business activity and (2) increased compensation levels. Salaries and related costs decreased 1% as a percentage of net revenues. Management believes that
this decrease is due to the Company's ability to service larger freight volumes with a relatively smaller group of people. Management attributes this to technological enhancement and operational
process improvement initiatives. The relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the
Company: offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee. Using this
compensation model, changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in Company profits. Management believes that the growth in revenues, net revenues and net earnings for 2000
are a result of the incentives inherent in the Company's compensation program.

Other
operating expenses increased in 2000 as compared with 1999 as rent expense, communications expense, quality and training expenses, and other costs expanded to accommodate the
Company's growing operations. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased 1% in 2000 as compared with 1999.

Other
income, net, increased in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to interest income earned on higher cash balances and short-term investments in 2000. Management attributes
higher cash balances, in large part, to the success of cash management and billing improvement initiatives.

The
Company pays income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations. The Company's consolidated
effective income tax rate remained relatively constant in 2000 at 37.7%.

1999 compared with 1998

Airfreight net revenues in 1999 increased 26% compared with 1998 primarily due to (1) increased airfreight shipments and tonnages handled by the Company
from the Far East to North America and


Europe, (2) increased prices charged by the airlines which were passed along to customers, and (3) increased export airfreight shipments and tonnages from North America and Europe. The
Company's North American export airfreight net revenues increased 21% in 1999 compared to 1998.
Airfreight net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 26% and 23%, respectively, for 1999 compared with 1998.

Ocean
freight net revenues increased 32% in 1999 compared to 1998. Ocean freight demand remained strong throughout 1999 and ocean freight rates from the Far East, the Company's
largest trade lane, increased in the last half of the year. During 1999, management continued to expand market share, increase ocean tonnage, and increase net ocean freight revenues while offering
competitive market rates to customers. Margins diminished slightly as a result of this increased demand and due to regulatory constraints which restricted the Company's ability to promptly pass
carrier rate increases to NVOCC customers. ECMS continued to be instrumental in attracting new business. The Company's North American export ocean freight net revenues increased 18% in 1999 compared
to 1998. This increase was a result of the Company handling more ocean shipments moving from North America to the Far East and, to a lesser extent, from North America to Europe. Ocean freight net
revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 36% and 32%, respectively, for 1999 compared with 1998.

Customs
brokerage and import services revenues increased 21% in 1999 as compared with 1998 as a result of (1) the Company's growing reputation for providing high quality
service, (2) consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics
management program, and (3) the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and distinct service offered to existing and potential customers. Distribution services accounted for
nearly 29% of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for 1999 compared with 1998.

Salaries
and related costs increased in 1999 compared to 1998 as a result of (1) the Company's increased hiring of sales, operations, and administrative personnel in existing and new
offices to accommodate increases in business activity and (2) increased compensation levels. Salaries and related costs remained constant as a percentage of net revenues.

Other
operating expenses increased in 1999 as compared with 1998 as rent expense, communications expense, quality and training expenses, and other costs expanded to accommodate the
Company's growing operations. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained constant in 1999 as compared with 1998.

Other
income, net, decreased in 1999 as compared to 1998 primarily due to smaller foreign exchange gains recorded in 1999 than in 1998. Interest income was slightly higher in 1999
than in 1998. Interest expense was also higher in 1999 due to an increase in short-term borrowings.

The
Company pays income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations. The Company's consolidated
effective income tax rate remained constant in 1999 at 37.5%.

Currency and Other Risk Factors

International air/ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. There
are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry; however, the Company's primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group.
While there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with multinational offices and agency networks, regional and local broker/forwarders remain a
competitive force.


Historically, the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service, including reliability, responsiveness, expertise,
convenience, and scope of operations. The Company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry. Recently, customers have exhibited a
trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as just-in-time inventory management. Accordingly, sophisticated
computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers.

Developing
these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers. Smaller and middle-tier competitors, in general, do not
have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network. As a result, there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry. Management
expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short- to medium-term.

The
nature of the Company's worldwide operations necessitates the Company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. This results in the Company being exposed
to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference. Some of the countries where the Company maintains offices and/or agency relationships have strict currency
control regulations which influence the Company's ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. The Company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements
among its offices or agents. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" establishes accounting standards for derivative
and hedging
transactions and is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. Adoption of this standard by the Company on January 1, 2001, had no material impact on the Company's
consolidated financial statements. The Company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the Company's ability
to move money freely around the world or the short-term financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most time-sensitive way to avoid short-term exchange losses. Any such hedging
activity during 2000, 1999 and 1998 was insignificant. Net foreign currency gains realized during 2000 were $309,000. Net foreign currency gains realized in 1999 were $196,000. Net foreign currency
losses realized in 1998 were $534,000.

The
Company has traditionally generated revenues from airfreight, ocean freight and customs brokerage and import services. In light of the customer-driven trend to provide customer
rates on a door-to-door basis, management foresees the potential, in the medium- to long-term, for fees normally associated with customs house brokerage to be de-emphasized and included as a component
of other services offered by the Company.

On
January 1, 1999, eleven of fifteen member countries of the European Union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies ("legacy currencies") and a
new common currency—the Euro. The Euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions. The conversion to the Euro eliminates currency exchange rate risk between the
member countries. Beginning in January 2002, new Euro-denominated bills and coins will be issued and legacy currencies will be withdrawn from circulation. The Company has established plans to
address the issues raised by the Euro currency conversion including the need to adapt computer systems and business processes to accommodate Euro-denominated transactions. Since existing financial
systems currently accommodate multiple currencies, the plans contemplate full conversion by the end of 2001. The Company does not expect the conversion costs to be material and is actively pursuing
conversion plans and initiatives to fully accommodate the introduction of the Euro as the financial reporting currency of the member states. Due to numerous uncertainties, the Company is evaluating
the effects one common European currency will have on pricing. The Company is unable to predict the resulting impact, if any, on the


Company's consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had not experienced any significant disruption as a result of this phased conversion.

Sources of Growth

Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the Company's competitors and typically involves the purchase of
significant "goodwill", the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired
business. As a result, the Company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions, where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the "goodwill"
recorded in the transaction.

The
Company, at the request of a major customer, opened an office in Huizen, The Netherlands during early 2000. When promised revenue levels were not achieved, the Company transferred
existing
business and personnel to other Netherlands offices and closed the Huizen office as of November 2000. This customer continues to purchase services from the Company.

Internal Growth

Management believes that a comparison of "same store" growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the Company's internally generated
growth. This "same store" analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the Company's operating results for at least one full year. The table below presents
"same store" comparisons on a year-over-year basis for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended
December 31, 2000 was approximately $154 million, as compared with $53 million for the same period of 1999. This $101 million increase is principally due to a smaller increase in accounts
receivable ($47 million) between 2000 and 1999 than was experienced between 1999 and 1998. Management believes that the smaller increase in accounts receivable is due to internal initiatives to
increase the quality and timeliness of customer billings, which in turn improved


the rate of customer collections. The Company also did a more effective job in 2000 of matching cash outflows with inflows. This resulted in a $16 million increase in accounts payable and other
accrued expenses and taxes payable in 2000 over the increase in 1999.

The
Company's business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality. Historically, the first quarter shows an excess of customer
collections over customer billings. This results in positive cash flow. The increased activity associated with peak season (typically commencing late second or early third quarter) causes an excess of
customer billings over customer collections. This cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash. In the past, the Company has utilized short-term borrowings to satisfy normal
operating expenditures when temporary cash outflows exceed cash inflows. These short-term borrowings have been repaid when the trend reverses and customer collections exceed customer billings. During
2000, short-term borrowings were not required in the United States; the market where cash flow pressures are most intense due to funds advanced in association with customs brokerage activity.

As
a customs broker, the Company makes significant 5-10 business day cash advances for the payment of duties and freight. These advances are made as an accommodation for a select
group of credit-worthy customers. Cash advances are a "pass through" and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense, but are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable and
accounts payable. As a result of these "pass through" billings, the conventional Days Sales Outstanding or DSO calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency.

Cash
used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $29 million, as compared with $32 million during the same period of 1999. The largest use of cash in
investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company made capital expenditures of $26 million as compared with $27 million for the same
period in 1999. Capital expenditures in 2000 and in 1999 related primarily to investments in technology and office furniture and equipment.

Cash
used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $23 million as compared with cash provided by financing activities of $2 million for the same period
in 1999. In 2000, the Company paid down $15 million on short-term debt, as compared with an increase in short-term debt of $7 million that occurred during the same period of 1999. The Company uses the
proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the Company's stock on the open market. The differences shown at year end of 2000 and 1999 between proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the
amounts paid to repurchase common stock represent a timing difference in the receipt of proceeds and the subsequent repurchase of outstanding shares.

At
December 31, 2000, working capital was $223 million, including cash and short-term investments of $171 million. The Company had no long-term debt at December 31,
2000. While the nature of its business does not require an extensive investment in property and equipment, the Company cannot eliminate the possibility that it could acquire an equity interest in
property in certain geographic locations. The Company currently expects to spend approximately $60 million on property and equipment in 2001. In addition to normal capital expenditures for leasehold
improvements, warehouse equipment, computer hardware and furniture and fixtures, this total includes estimates for building projects in Egypt, Ireland and Malaysia. The Company expects to finance
capital expenditures in 2001, with cash.

The
Company borrows internationally and domestically under unsecured bank lines of credit. The U.S. facility totals $50 million and international bank lines of credit totaled $11.1
million. In addition, the Company maintains a bank facility with its U.K. bank for $7.4 million. At December 31, 2000, the Company was directly liable for $4.7 million drawn on these lines of
credit and was contingently liable for an additional $24.2 million from standby letters of credit.


Management believes that the Company's current cash position, bank financing arrangements, and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements
for the foreseeable future.

In
some cases, the Company's ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls. In addition, certain undistributed earnings of the
Company's subsidiaries accumulated through December 31, 1992 would, under most circumstances, be subject to some additional United States income tax if distributed to the Company. The Company
has not provided for this additional tax because the Company intends to reinvest such earnings to fund the expansion of its foreign activities, or to distribute them in a manner in which no
significant additional taxes would be incurred.

Impact of Inflation

To date, the Company's business has not been adversely affected by inflation, nor has the Company experienced significant difficulty in passing carrier rate
increases on to its customers by means of price increases. Direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short- to medium-term period. Due to the high degree of competition in the market place,
these rate increases might lead to an erosion in the Company's margins. However, as the Company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive
property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest rate-sensitive indebtedness, the Company currently has no direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in
interest rates.

The
forward-looking statements contained in this document involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these
statements include, but are not limited to: risks associated with foreign operations, elimination of intercompany transactions, matching of expenses with the associated revenue, seasonality, shifts in
consumer demand, the effect that the adoption of the Euro as the primary currency of 11 member states of the European Union might have on the global economy and the Company's international and
domestic customers, other accounting estimates and other risk factors disclosed from time to time in the Company's public reports.

ITEM 7A—QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business. These risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in
short-term interest rates. The potential impact of the Company's exposure to these risks is presented below:

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company conducts business in many different countries and currencies. The Company's business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and
currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred. In the ordinary course of business, the Company creates numerous intercompany transactions. This brings a
market risk to the Company's earnings.

Foreign
exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the Company's earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar,
the Company's functional currency, relative to the other currencies in which the Company transacts business. All other things being equal, an average 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar, throughout the
year ended December 31, 2000, would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately $8.8 million. An average 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, for the same period, would have
the effect of reducing operating income approximately $7.2 million.


The Company has approximately $30 million of intercompany transactions unsettled at any one point in time. The Company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to
manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the Company's ability to move money
freely around the world. Any such hedging activity throughout the year ended December 31, 2000, was insignificant. The Company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency
settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings. The majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course
of business are fully settled within 90 days.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2000, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $170.9 million and short-term borrowings of $4.7 million,
all subject to variable short-term interest rates. A hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10% would have an insignificant impact on the Company's earnings.

In
management's opinion, there has been no material change in the Company's market risk exposure between 1999 and 2000.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. Basis of Presentation

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. ("the Company") is a global logistics company operating through a worldwide network of offices,
international service centers and exclusive or non-exclusive agents. The Company's customers include retailing and wholesaling, electronics, and manufacturing companies around the world. The Company
grants credit upon approval to customers.

International
trade is influenced by many factors, including economic and political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange rates, and United States and foreign
laws and policies relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, foreign investments and taxation. Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions. The
Company cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals may be adopted, nor can the Company predict the effects adoption of any such proposal will have on the Company's business. Doing business in
foreign locations also subjects the Company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises. In addition to being affected by governmental policies concerning
international trade, the
Company's business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. In addition, the accounts of exclusive agents have been consolidated in those
circumstances where the Company maintains unilateral control over the agents' assets and operations, notwithstanding a lack of technical majority ownership of the agents' common stock.

All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

All
dollar amounts in the notes are presented in thousands except for share data.

B. Short-term Investments

Short-term investments are designated as available-for-sale and cost approximates market at December 31, 2000 and 1999.

C. Long-Lived Assets, Depreciation and Amortization

Property and equipment are recorded at cost, including interest capitalized for the construction of certain facilities, and are depreciated or amortized on the
straight-line method over the shorter of the assets' estimated useful lives or lease terms. Useful lives for major categories of property and equipment are as follows:

Buildings

28 to 40 years

Furniture, fixtures and equipment

3 to 5 years

Vehicles

3 to 5 years

No
interest was capitalized in 2000 and 1999. Interest of $193 was capitalized in 1998.

Expenditures
for maintenance, repairs, and renewals of minor items are charged to earnings as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Upon disposition, the cost and
related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in income for the period.

F-6

The excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses (included in other assets, net) is amortized on the straight-line method over periods up to 40
years.

In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Assets to Be Disposed Of", long-lived assets
(property and equipment) and certain identifiable intangible assets (excess costs over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-term assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of such assets against the
undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the assets'
carrying amounts exceeds the assets' discounted future cash flows.

D. Revenues and Revenue Recognition

Airfreight revenues include the charges to the Company for carrying the shipments when the Company acts as a freight consolidator. Ocean freight revenues
include the charges to the Company for carrying the shipments when the Company acts as a Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC). Revenues realized in other capacities include only the commissions
and fees earned.

Revenues
related to shipments are recognized at the time the freight is tendered to a direct carrier at origin. All other revenues, including breakbulk services, local transportation,
customs formalities, distribution services and logistics management, are recognized upon performance.

E. Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

F. Net Earnings per Common Share

Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive potential
common shares represent outstanding stock options. Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average of common shares outstanding without taking into consideration dilutive potential
common shares outstanding.

G. Foreign Currency

Foreign currency amounts attributable to foreign operations have been translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities,
historical rates for equity, and average annual rates for revenues and expenses. Unrealized gains or losses arising from fluctuations in the year-end exchange rates are generally recorded as
components of other comprehensive income as adjustments from foreign currency translation. Currency fluctuations are a normal operating factor in the conduct of

F-7

the Company's business, and exchange transaction gains and losses are generally included in freight consolidation expenses.

SFAS
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" establishes accounting standards for derivative and hedging transactions and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000. Adoption of this standard by the Company on January 1, 2001, had no material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company follows
a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage its foreign exchange exposure. Accordingly, the Company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited
locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the Company's ability to move money freely around the world. Such hedging activity during 2000, 1999, and 1998 was insignificant. Net
foreign currency gains realized during 2000 and 1999 were $309 and $196, respectively. Net foreign currency losses realized during 1998 was $534.

H. Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

I. Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting shareholders' equity that, under generally accepted accounting principles, are
excluded from net income. For the Company, these consist of foreign currency translation gains and losses, net of related income tax effects.

J. Segment Reporting

The Company is organized functionally in geographic operating segments. Accordingly, management focuses its attention on revenues, net revenues, operating
income, identifiable assets, capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization and equity generated by or allocated to each of these geographical areas when evaluating effectiveness of geographic
management.

K. Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

L. Reclassification

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2000 presentation.

NOTE 2. CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

The Company has a $50,000 United States bank line of credit extending through June 29, 2001. Borrowings under the line bear interest at LIBOR +0.75% (7.18% at
December 31, 2000) and are unsecured. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had no borrowings under this line.

F-8

The majority of the Company's foreign subsidiaries maintain bank lines of credit for short-term working capital purposes. These credit lines are supported by standby letters of credit
issued by a United States bank, or guarantees issued by the Company to the foreign banks issuing the credit line. Lines of credit bear interest at .5% to 1.5% over the foreign banks' equivalent prime
rates. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company was liable for $4,671 and $1,442, respectively, of borrowings under these lines, and at December 31, 2000 was contingently liable for
approximately $24,154 under outstanding standby letters of credit and guarantees related to these lines of credit and other obligations.

In
addition, at December 31, 2000 the Company had a $7,392 credit facility with a United Kingdom bank (U.K. facility), secured by a corporate guarantee. The Company was
contingently liable under the U.K. facility at December 31, 2000 for $7,392 used to secure customs bonds issued by foreign governments.

At
December 31, 2000, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants of these credit lines and the associated credit facilities, including maintenance of certain
minimum asset, working capital and equity balances and ratios.

At
December 31, 2000, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for foreign income tax purposes of $22 which are available over an indefinite period to offset future
foreign taxable income.

The
Company has not provided U.S. Federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries accumulated through December 31, 1992 since the Company intends to
reinvest such earnings indefinitely or to distribute them in a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be incurred. Such undistributed earnings are approximately $41,900 and the
additional Federal and state taxes payable in a hypothetical distribution of such accumulated earnings would approximate $10,100. Since 1993, the Company has been providing for Federal and state
income tax expense on foreign earnings without regard to whether such earnings will be permanently reinvested outside the United States.

NOTE 4. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

A. Dividends

On May 5, 1999, the Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split, effected in the form of a stock dividend of one share of common stock for every
share outstanding, and increased the authorized common stock to 160,000,000 shares. The stock dividend was distributed on May 31, 1999 to shareholders of record on May 17, 1999. All
share and per share information, except par value, has been adjusted for all years to reflect the stock split.

B. Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan

The Company has a Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan under which management is authorized to repurchase up to 2,200,000 shares of the Company's common
stock in the open market with the proceeds received from the exercise of Employee and Director Stock Options. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had repurchased and retired 2,061,560 shares
of common stock at an average price of $16.33 over the period from 1994 through 2000. Subsequent to December 31, 2000, the amount of shares to be repurchased was increased to 5,000,000.

C. Stock Option Plans

The Company has two stock option plans (the "1985 Plan" and the "1997 Plan") for employees under which the Board of Directors may grant officers and key
employees options to purchase common stock at prices equal to or greater than market value on the date of grant. The 1985 Plan provides for

F-11

non-qualified grants at exercise prices equal to or greater than the market value on the date of grant. Outstanding options generally vest and become exercisable over periods up to five years from the
date of grant and expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant. The 1997 Plan provides for qualified and non-qualified grants of options to purchase shares, limited to not more than 100,000 per
person per year. Grants less than or equal to 20,000 shares in any fiscal year, are granted at or above common stock prices on the date of grant. Any 1997 Plan grants in excess of the initial 20,000
shares granted per person per year ("Excess Grants") require an exercise price of not less than 120% of the common stock price on the date of grant. Excess Grants expire no later than 5 years from the
date of grant. Excess Grants in 1997 vested completely, 3 years from the date of grant.

The
Company also has a stock option plan ("Directors' Plan") under which non-employee directors elected at each annual meeting are granted non-qualified options to purchase 8,000
shares of common stock on the first business day of the month following the meeting.

Upon
the exercise of non-qualified stock options, the Company derives a tax deduction measured by the excess of the market value over the option price at the date of exercise. The
related tax benefit is credited to additional paid-in capital.

The
Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option and its employee stock purchase rights plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost
has been recognized for its fixed stock option or employee stock purchase rights plans. Had compensation cost for the Company's three stock based compensation and employee stock purchase rights plans
been

F-12

determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company's net earnings, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share would have been decreased to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

E. Stock Purchase Plan

The Company's 1988 Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides for 2,800,000 shares of the Company's common stock to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of
purchase rights granted to employees who elect to participate through regular payroll deductions beginning August 1 of each year. The purchase rights are exercisable on July 31 of the
following year at a price equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair market value of the Company's stock on July 31 or (2) 85% of the fair market value of the Company's stock on
the preceding August 1. At December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, an aggregate of 2,373,253 shares, 2,169,235 shares and 1,917,844 shares, respectively, had been issued under the plan, and at
December 31, 2000, $3,360 had been withheld in connection with the plan year ending July 31, 2001.

NOTE 5. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company's financial instruments, other than cash, consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, short-term debt,
accounts payable and accrued expenses, and stock purchase rights. The fair values of these financial instruments, excluding stock purchase rights, approximate their carrying amounts based upon market
interest rates or their short-term nature. The fair value of the stock purchase rights, which have a carrying value of zero, has been determined using market prices for the related stock, and is
approximately $1,364 as of December 31, 2000.
