Forward-Looking Statements

In accordance with the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is making readers aware that forward-looking statements, because they relate to future events, are by their very nature subject to many
important risk factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. For additional information about forward-looking statements and for an identification of risk factors and their
potential significance, see “Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements Under Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995; Certain Cautionary Statements” immediately preceding Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this report.

PART I

ITEM 1—BUSINESS

Expeditors International
of Washington, Inc. is engaged in the business of providing global logistics services. The Company offers its customers a seamless international network supporting the movement and strategic positioning of goods. The Company’s services include
the consolidation or forwarding of air and ocean freight. In each United States office, and in many overseas offices, the Company acts as a customs broker. The Company also provides additional services including distribution management, vendor
consolidation, cargo insurance, purchase order management and customized logistics information. The Company does not compete for domestic freight, overnight courier or small parcel business and does not own aircraft or steamships.

Beginning in 1981, the Company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from Asia to the United States and related customs brokerage and
other services. In the mid-1980’s, the Company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight, ocean freight and distribution services. Today the Company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a
diversified group of customers, both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location. As opportunities for profitable growth arise, the Company plans to create new offices. While the Company has historically expanded through organic
growth, the Company has also been open to growth through acquisition of, or establishing joint ventures with, existing agents or others within the industry.

The Company, including its majority-owned subsidiaries, operates full service offices (•) in the cities identified below. Full service offices have also been established in locations where the Company maintains
unilateral control over assets and operations and where the existence of the parent-subsidiary relationship is maintained by means other than record ownership of voting stock (#). In other cities, the Company contracts with independent agents to
provide required services and has established approximately 51 such relationships world-wide. Locations where Company employees perform sales and customer service functions are identified below as international service centers (*). Wholly-owned
locations operating under the supervision and control of another full service office are identified as satellite offices (+). In each case, the opening date for the full service office, international service center or satellite office is set forth
in parenthesis.



The Company was incorporated in the State
of Washington in May 1979. Its executive offices are located at 1015 Third Avenue, 12

th

Floor, Seattle, Washington, and its telephone number is
(206) 674-3400.

The Company’s internet address is http://www.expeditors.com. The Company makes available free of charge through
its internet website its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

For information concerning the amount of revenues, net revenues, operating income,
identifiable assets, capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization attributable to the geographic areas in which the Company conducts its business, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

Airfreight Services

Airfreight services
accounted for approximately 36 percent for each of the Company’s 2008, 2007, and 2006 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses (“net revenues”), respectively. When performing airfreight services, the Company
typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment. When acting as a freight consolidator, the Company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its
customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines. When moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation, the Company receives and forwards individual shipments as the
agent of the airline which carries the shipment. Whether acting as an agent or consolidator, the Company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing, familiarity with local business practices, knowledge of export and import documentation and
procedures, the ability to arrange for ancillary services, and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand.

In its
airfreight forwarding operations, the Company procures shipments from its customers, determines the routing, consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point, and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution
point. At the distribution point, the Company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations.


The Company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3,500 pounds and a
typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers. Because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation, air shipments are generally characterized by a high value-to-weight ratio, the need for rapid
delivery, or both.

The Company typically delivers shipments from a Company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the
freight into containers or onto pallets. Shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within forty-eight hours after such delivery. During peak shipment periods, cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can
be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur. When these conditions exist, the Company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand.

The Company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in cost-effective combinations. Typically, as the weight or volume of a shipment increases, the cost per pound/kilo or cubic inch/centimeter charged by
the Company decreases. The rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases. As a result, by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single
shipment, the Company is able to obtain a lower rate per pound/kilo or cubic inch/centimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment, while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the
airline for an unconsolidated shipment.

The Company’s airfreight forwarding net revenues from a consolidated shipment include the
differential between the rate charged to the Company by an airline and the rate which the Company charges to its customers, commissions paid to the Company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services. Such ancillary
services provided by the Company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation, packing, crating and insurance services, negotiation of letters of credit, and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws. When the
Company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment, its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer.

The Company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the
individual shipments. Breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipments.

The Company does not
own aircraft and does not plan to do so. Management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the Company to undue business risks, including large capital outlays, increased fixed operating expenses, problems of fully utilizing
aircraft and competition with airlines. Because the Company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments, changes in carrier policies and practices such as pricing, payment terms, scheduling, and frequency of service may affect its
business.

Ocean Freight and Ocean Services

Ocean freight services accounted for approximately 25, 24, and 25 percent of the Company’s 2008, 2007, and 2006 consolidated net revenues, respectively. The Company operates Expeditors International Ocean
(“EIO”), an Ocean Transportation Intermediary, sometimes referred to as a Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (“NVOCC”) specializing in ocean freight consolidation from Asia to the United States. EIO also provides service, on a
smaller scale, to and from any location where the Company has an office or agent. As an NVOCC, EIO contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time
period at an agreed rate. EIO solicits Less-than Container Load (“LCL”) freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines. EIO also handles full container loads for customers
that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers. The Company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are also derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues
from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the Company may provide, such as preparing documentation, procuring insurance, arranging for packing and crating services, and providing consultation. The Company does not own vessels
and generally does not physically handle the cargo.

Order Management (previously referred to as ECMS or Expeditors Cargo Management
System) provides origin consolidation, vendor management, container management, document management, destination management and PO/SKU visibility through a web based and server based application. Customers have the ability to monitor and report
against real time status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery. Item quantities, required ship dates, commodity descriptions, estimated vs. actual ex factory dates, container utilization, vendor performance and document
visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web. Order Management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean, air, truck and rail. Order Management revenues are derived from services
provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules. One basic function of Order Management involves the taking of cargo from


many vendors in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space and
minimize cost. Through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers. Data integrity is an increasingly critical function of Order Management. Efficient data
management is a by-product of our operational processes.

Customs Brokerage and Other Services

Customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 39, 40 and 39 percent of the Company’s 2008, 2007, and 2006 consolidated net
revenues, respectively. As a customs broker, the Company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer, arranging for any
required inspections by governmental agencies, and arranging for delivery. The Company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and product distribution, time definite transportation and inventory
management. None of these other services are currently individually significant to the Company’s net revenues.

The Company
provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder. However, substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder. Conversely,
shipments handled by the Company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer.

The Company also
provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the United States, Canada and/or Mexico. The commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the Company to continue to make
enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service.

The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Expeditors Tradewin,
L.L.C., responds to customer driven requests for high-end customs consulting services. Fees for these non-transactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects.

Marketing and Customers

The Company
provides flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate destinations. Although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required, the
foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process. Therefore, the Company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers.

The Company’s marketing efforts are focused primarily on the traffic, shipping and purchasing departments of existing and potential
customers. The district manager of each office is responsible for marketing, sales coordination, and implementation in the area in which he or she is located. All employees are responsible for customer service and relations.

The Company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive
experience in global logistics. Marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the Company’s services directly to local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection of the logistics vendor
and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service. The Company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers, its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer
service and marketing activities, and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success.

The goods
handled by the Company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination. Shipments of computer components, other electronic equipment, housewares, sporting goods, machine
parts, and toys, comprise a significant percentage of the Company’s business. Typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of consumer electronics, department store chains, clothing and shoe wholesalers,
manufacturers and catalogue stores. Historically, no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the Company’s net revenues.

Competition

The global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable
future. There are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry, but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited. Depending on the location of
the shipper and the importer, the Company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities. While there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational
and multi-service networks, the regional and local competitors maintain a strong market presence.


Historically, the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry have been price
and quality of service, including reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of operations. The Company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the
industry. Larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as just-in-time inventory management. Accordingly, computerized customer
service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers. These computerized customer service capabilities include customized Electronic Data Interchange, (“EDI”), and on-line freight tracing and tracking
applications. The customized EDI applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers’ systems and the Company’s systems. Freight tracing and tracking applications provide customers with real time visibility
to the location, transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit.

Management believes that the ability to develop and
deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the Company. The Company devotes a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance
and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands. Management believes that the Company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes.

Unlike many of its competitors, who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition, the Company operates the same accounting and
transportation computer software, running on a common hardware platform, in all of its full-service locations. Small and middle-tier competitors, in general, do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems. As a
result, there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry. Management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short- to medium-term. Historically, growth through aggressive
acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the Company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill.” As a result, the Company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented
by certain strategic acquisitions.

The Company’s ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience
in global logistics services is an essential, if not the most important, element of its ability to compete in the industry. To this end, the Company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch net revenues or
profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel. The Company believes that these incentive compensation programs, combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts, provide it with
a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have generally matched only through acquisition.

Currency and Other Risk Factors

The nature of the Company’s worldwide operations necessitate the Company dealing with a
multitude of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This results in the Company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference. Many of the countries where the Company maintains
offices and/or agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the Company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. The Company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international
currency settlements among these offices or agents.

In addition, the Company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly
dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines, steamship lines and governmental agencies. The Company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be good. However, changes in
the financial stability and operating capabilities of asset-based carriers, space allotments available from carriers, governmental deregulation efforts, “modernization” of the regulations governing customs clearance, and/or changes in
governmental quota restrictions could affect the Company’s business in unpredictable ways.

Seasonality

Historically, the Company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis. The first quarter has
traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest. This pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic
conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces. In addition, this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the Company’s international network and service offerings. The Company
cannot accurately forecast many of these factors, nor can the Company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods.


Environmental

In the United States, the Company is subject to Federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment. Similar laws
apply in many other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws, governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental
issues, and the Company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business. The Company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of
the current or succeeding fiscal years.

Employees

At January 31, 2009, the Company employed approximately 12,580 people, 4,390 in the United States and 750 in the balance of North America, 630 in Latin America, 3,520 in Asia, 2,020 in Europe and Africa, 1,040 in
the Middle East

and 230 in Australasia. Approximately 1,790 of the Company’s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service, 7,300 in operations and 3,490 in finance and administration. The
Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory.

In order
to retain the services of highly qualified, experienced, and motivated employees, the Company places considerable emphasis on its non-equity incentive compensation programs and stock option plans.

Regulation and Security

With respect to the Company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the United States, it is subject to regulation by the Transportation Security Administration of the Department of Homeland Security
as an indirect air carrier. The Company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation. The Company is licensed in each of its offices, or in the case of its newer
offices, has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”). IATA is a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities which prescribes certain
operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members. The majority of the Company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are IATA members.

The Company is registered as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary (“OTI”) (sometimes referred to as NVOCC-

N

on-

V

essel

O

wned

C

ommon

C

arrier) by the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”). The FMC has established certain qualifications for shipping agents, including certain surety bonding requirements. The FMC is also responsible for the
economic regulation of OTI/NVOCC activity originating or terminating in the United States. To comply with these economic regulations, vessel operators and NVOCCs, such as EIO, are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the
rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the United States. The FMC has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties.

The Company is licensed as a customs broker by Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) of the Department of Homeland Security in each U.S.
customs district in which it does business. All United States customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by CBP. In other jurisdictions in which the Company performs clearance services,
the Company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority. The Company participates in various governmental supply chain security programs, such as the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT”) in the United States and
additional security initiatives as they continue to be enacted by different governments.

The Company does not believe that current United
States and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations. In general, the Company conducts its business activities in each country through a majority-owned subsidiary corporation that is
organized and existing under the laws of that country. However, the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the Company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority United
States-owned subsidiary. For example, foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding and/or freight consolidation is
restricted to local entities. When the Company encounters this sort of governmental restriction, it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the Company the substantive
operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation. This can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license. In
cases where the Company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the local entity, notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of common stock, the Company consolidates the accounts of the local entity. In such
cases, consolidation is necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the Company because of the existence of the parent-subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting common stock.

The war on terror and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import and/or export goods into
and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo security regulations over the past several years. While these cargo regulations have already created a marked difference in the security arrangements required to move
shipments around the globe, regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future. As governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terror related incidents, the Company and its competitors in the
transportation business may be required to incorporate security procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past. The Company feels that increased security requirements may involve further
investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to potential customers, vendors and employees. While many of these regulations have not been finalized at this time, it is the Company’s position that much of
the increased costs of compliance with security regulations will need to be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of the Company’s services.

Cargo Liability

When acting as an airfreight consolidator, the Company assumes a carrier’s liability
for lost or damaged shipments. This legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value (17

S

pecial

D

rawing

R

ights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and
pays a surcharge), except if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill. The airline which the Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the Company in the same
manner and to the same extent. When acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper, the Company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline.


When acting as an ocean freight consolidator, the Company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or
damaged shipments. This liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value ($500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a
surcharge). The steamship line which the Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the Company in the same manner and to the same extent. In its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations, the
Company does not assume cargo liability.

When providing warehouse and distribution services, the Company limits its legal liability by
contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or $0.50 per pound with a maximum of $50 per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track. Upon payment of a
surcharge for warehouse and distribution services, the Company will assume additional liability.

The Company maintains marine cargo
insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable. The Company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in Company warehouse
facilities. This insurance coverage is provided by a Vermont U.S. based insurance entity wholly owned by the Company. The coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company. The total risk retained by the Company in 2008
was approximately $4 million. In addition, the Company is licensed as an insurance broker through its subsidiary, Expeditors Cargo Insurance Brokers, Inc. and places stand alone insurance coverage for other customers.

ITEM 1B — UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

Not applicable.

ITEM 2 — PROPERTIES

The Company owns the following properties:

*

Company directly owns 50% with Cargo Ventures, LLC, a private, non-affiliated real estate development company.

The Company leases and maintains 66 additional offices and satellite locations in the United States and 373 leased locations throughout the world, each
located close to an airport, ocean port, or on an important border crossing. The majority of these facilities contain warehouse facilities. Lease terms are either on a month-to-month basis or terminate at various times through
2019. See Note 6 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for lease commitments. As an office matures, the Company will investigate the possibility of building or buying suitable facilities. The Company believes that current
leases can be extended and that suitable alternative facilities are available in the vicinity of each present facility should extensions be unavailable at the conclusion of current leases.

ITEM 3 — LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On
October 10, 2007, the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a subpoena ordering the Company to produce certain information and records relating to an investigation of alleged anti-competitive behavior amongst air cargo freight forwarders.
The Company has retained the services of a law firm to assist in complying with the DOJ’s subpoena. As part of this process, the Company has met with and continues to co-operate with the DOJ. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had
incurred approximately $14 million of cumulative legal and associated costs. The Company expects to incur additional costs during the course of this ongoing investigation, which could include fines and/or penalties if the DOJ concludes that the
Company has engaged in anti-competitive behavior and such fines and/or penalties could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and operating cash flows.


On January 3, 2008, the Company was named as a defendant, with seven other European and North
American-based global logistics providers, in a Federal antitrust class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court of the Eastern District of New York, Precision Associates, Inc. et al v. Panalpina World Transport, No. 08-CV0042.
The plaintiffs’ complaint, which purports to be brought on behalf of a class of customers (and has not yet been certified), asserts claims that the defendants engaged in price fixing regarding the provision of of freight forwarding services in
violation of the Sherman Act. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief. The Company believes that these allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself.

On June 18, 2008, the European Commission (EC) issued a request for information to the Company’s UK subsidiary, Expeditors International (UK) Ltd.,
requesting certain information relating to an ongoing investigation of freight forwarders. The Company replied to the request. On February 18, 2009, the EC issued another request for information to the same subsidiary requesting certain additional
information in connection with the EC’s ongoing investigation of freight forwarders. The Company intends to respond to this latest request for information. The Company expects to incur additional costs during the course of this ongoing
investigation, which could include administrative fines if the EC concludes that the Company has engaged in anti-competitive behavior and such fines could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and
operating cash flows.

On May 16, 2008, a former employee filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California, Kingery v. Expeditors International of Washington, Inc., No. 08-02510. The original lawsuit, purported to be brought on behalf of some group of current and former salaried
management and supervisory employees, which the plaintiff alleges were misclassified as exempt from overtime and meal/rest breaks under California and Federal law. In February 2009, plaintiff, through his counsel, announced that the lawsuit will not
be prosecuted as a class action, but solely as a lawsuit involving plaintiff individually. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief. The Company believes that these allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend
itself. Further, in management’s opinion, the lawsuit will not have a significant effect on the Company’s operations or financial position.

At this time the Company is unable to estimate the range of loss or damages, if any, that might result as an outcome of any of these proceedings.

The Company is involved in other claims and lawsuits which arise in the ordinary course of business, none of which currently, in management’s
opinion, will have a significant effect on the Company’s operations or financial position.

The Board of Directors declared semi-annual dividends during the two most recent fiscal years as follows:

ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

In November 1993, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a Non-Discretionary Stock
Repurchase Plan for the purpose of repurchasing the Company’s common stock in the open market with the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. This plan was amended in February 2001 to increase the authorization to repurchase
up to 20,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. On February 9, 2009, the Plan was further amended to increase the authorization to repurchase up to 40,000,000 shares. This authorization has no expiration date. This plan
was disclosed in the Company’s report on Form 10-K filed March 31, 1995. In the fourth quarter of 2008, 77,106 shares were repurchased under the Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan.

In November 2001, under a Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of such shares as may
be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 200,000,000 shares of common stock. The maximum number of shares available for repurchase under this plan will increase as the total number of outstanding shares increase. This
authorization has no expiration date. This plan was announced on November 13, 2001. In the fourth quarter of 2008, 200,713 shares were repurchased under the Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan. These discretionary repurchases
were made to limit the growth in the number of issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises.

ITEM 7 — MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Executive Summary

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. is
engaged in the business of global logistics management, including international freight forwarding and consolidation, for both air and ocean freight. The Company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices, and in many of its international
offices. The Company also provides additional services for its customers including value-added distribution, purchase order management, vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions. The Company does not compete for overnight courier
or small parcel business. The Company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships.

International trade is influenced by many factors, including
economic and political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange rates, and United States and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, foreign investments, taxation and regional and global
conflicts. Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions. The Company cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals may be adopted, nor can the Company predict the effects the adoption
of any such proposal will have on the Company’s business. Doing business in foreign locations also subjects the Company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises. In addition to being
influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade, the Company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business.

The Company derives its revenues from three principal sources: 1) airfreight services, 2) ocean freight and ocean services, and 3) customs brokerage and other
services. These are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements.

The Company is managed along four geographic areas of
responsibility: Americas; Asia; Europe, Africa, Near/Middle East and Indian Subcontinent (EMAIR); and Australasia. Each area is divided into sub-regions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss
responsibility. The Company’s business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area. The nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and
cooperation among operating units. Because of this inter-relationship between operating units, it is very difficult to look at one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the Company’s overall success on a
stand-alone basis.

The Company’s operating units share revenue using the same arms-length pricing methodologies the Company uses when its offices
transact business with independent agents. The Company’s strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability. Individual success likely involves cooperation with other operating units.


As a non-asset based carrier, the Company does not own transportation assets. Rather, the Company generates the
major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct (asset-based) carriers and reselling those services to its customers. The difference between the rate billed to customers (the sell rate), and
the rate paid to the carrier (the buy rate) is termed “net revenue” or “yield.” By consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power, the Company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from
the direct carriers, while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves.

Customs brokerage
and other services involves providing services at destination, such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers
as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies, and arranging for delivery. This is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which
the Company has offices.

The Company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety
of entities including airlines, ocean steamship lines, and governmental agencies. The significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and asset-based carriers involved in global trade has gained increased
importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism. As each carrier labors to comply with governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures, inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade to some
degree. A good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will effectively meet security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles. The Company considers its current working relationships
with these entities to be satisfactory. However, changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities of asset-based carriers, space allotments available from carriers, governmental regulation or deregulation efforts,
“modernization” of the regulations governing customs brokerage, and/or changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the Company’s business in unpredictable ways.

Historically, the Company’s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis. The first quarter has traditionally
been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest. This pattern is the result of, or is influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and a
myriad of other similar and subtle forces. In addition, this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the Company’s international network and service offerings. The Company cannot accurately
forecast many of these factors nor can the Company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance that historical patterns, if any, will continue in future periods.

Primarily as a result of the global economic downturn, the Company’s air and ocean freight volumes were lower in the second half of 2008 as compared to the same
period in 2007. Also, airfreight volumes in the second half of 2008 were lower than volumes in the first half of 2008. These results are unprecedented in the Company’s history. At this point in time, the Company cannot predict the ongoing
impact of the current global economic downturn or whether various governmental stimulus plans will be effective.

A significant portion of the
Company’s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand, and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just-in-time production
schedules. Therefore, the timing of the Company’s revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of the Company’s control, such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods and/or manufacturing production
delays. Additionally, many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and therefore, the Company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter. To the extent that a shortfall in
revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the Company’s stock.

In terms of the opportunities, challenges and risks that management focused on in 2008, the Company operates in 61 countries throughout the world in the competitive
global logistics industry and Company activities are tied directly to the global economy. From the inception of the Company, management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured
through recruiting, training, and ultimately retaining superior personnel. The Company’s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global culture which demands:

•

Total dedication, first and foremost, to providing superior customer service;

•

Aggressive marketing of all of the Company’s service offerings;

•

Ongoing development of key employees and management personnel via formal and informal means;

•

Creation of unlimited advancement opportunities for employees dedicated to hard work, personal growth and continuous improvement;

•

Individual commitment to the identification and mentoring of successors for every key position so that when inevitable change is required, a qualified and
well-trained internal candidate is ready to step forward; and

•

Continuous identification, design and implementation of system solutions, both technological and otherwise, to meet and exceed the needs of our customers
while simultaneously delivering tools to make our employees more efficient and more effective.


The Company has reinforced these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the
things they can control. There is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success. The Company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit
implications of their decisions. At the same time, the Company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection, cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of
catastrophic errors that might end a career.

Any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a self-sustained basis throughout the Company, provides a
greater threat to the Company’s continued success than any external force, which would be largely beyond our control. Consequently, management spends the majority of its time focused on creating an environment where employees can learn and
develop while also improving systems and taking preventative action to reduce exposure to negative events. The Company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that, in the aggregate, could have a positive or a negative
impact on future operations. As a result our focus is on building and maintaining a global culture of well-trained employees and managers that are prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the Company
adapt and thrive as major trends emerge.

Critical Accounting Estimates

A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.

Management believes that the nature of the Company’s business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations.

While judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting, the Company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas:

•

accounts receivable valuation;

•

the useful lives of long-term assets;

•

the accrual of costs related to ancillary services the Company provides;

•

establishment of adequate insurance liabilities for the portion of the freight related exposure which the Company has self-insured;

•

accrual of various tax liabilities; and

•

calculation of share-based compensation expense.

These estimates, other than the calculation of share-based compensation expense, are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change. Management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are
non-aggressive in approach and consistent in application. Management believes that there are limited, if any, alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the Company’s transactions. While the use of
estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates, the Company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates, other than the calculation of share-based compensation
expense, would not produce materially different results than those reported.

As described in Note 1I to the consolidated financial statements in this
report, the Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R (revised 2004), “Share-based Payment” (SFAS 123R). This accounting standard requires the recognition of
compensation expense based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees and directors under the Company’s stock option and employee stock purchase plans. This expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the option
vesting periods.

Determining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment. Any option pricing
model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment. Examples include assumptions about long-term stock price volatility, employee exercise patterns, pre-vesting option forfeitures, post-vesting option
cancellations, and the future interest rates and dividend yields.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options.
Refer to Note 4F in the consolidated financial statements for the assumptions used for grants issued during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The assumptions used by the Company for estimating the fair value of options granted
under SFAS 123R were developed on a basis consistent with assumptions used for valuing previous grants.

Management believes that these assumptions are
appropriate, based upon the requirements of SFAS 123R, the guidance included in Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) and the company’s historical and currently expected future experience. Looking
to future events, management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be material.


The Company’s expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock.
The expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in
effect at the time of grant for U.S. Treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option, i.e. a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an option with a ten year expected life. The expected dividend yield is based on the
Company’s historical experience. The forfeiture rate used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical pre-vesting employee forfeiture patterns.

The use of different assumptions would result in different amounts of stock compensation expense. Keeping all other variables constant, the indicated change in each of the assumptions below increases or decreases the
fair value of an option (and the resulting stock compensation expense), as follows:

The fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life
assumptions. The pre-vesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate. Therefore, changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period.
Different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period. Estimated forfeitures will be reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51” (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 changes the accounting and reporting for
minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. SFAS 160 modifies the accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling
equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is required to and
plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS 160 beginning in the first quarter of 2009. The Company had minority interest of $17,498 as of December 31, 2008 and $17,208 as of December 31, 2007, that it expects will be reclassified to equity
under the provisions of SFAS 160.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business
Combinations” (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the
acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS 141R beginning in the first quarter of 2009. The impact will depend upon the acquisitions, if
any, the Company consummates after the effective date.


Results of Operations

The
following table shows the consolidated net revenues (revenues less transportation expenses) attributable to the Company’s principal services and the Company’s expenses for 2008, 2007, and 2006, expressed as percentages of net
revenues. Management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the Company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the Company as a freight consolidator include the
carriers’ charges to the Company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the Company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the Company.

2008 compared with 2007

Airfreight services net revenues in 2008 increased 10% compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in net revenue per kilo of 12% which was offset by a 4% decline in global airfreight tonnage. Airfreight services
net revenues from North America and Europe increased 14% and 13%, respectively, in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily a result of tonnage increases of 6% and 3%, respectively, combined with net revenue per kilo increases of 11% and 6%,
respectively. Airfreight services net revenues from Asia increased 1% for 2008 compared with 2007, primarily a result of a 14% increase in net revenue per kilo offset by an 11% decrease in tonnage. These changes are primarily the result of a more
favorable business mix, reduction in less profitable business, development of more profitable long haul routes and enhanced opportunities to create more efficient and cost effective consolidations.

Ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 14% during 2008, as compared to 2007. Ocean freight net revenues are comprised of three basic
services: ocean freight consolidation, direct ocean forwarding and order management. The majority of the Company’s ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 59% of ocean freight net revenue in 2008
and 60% in 2007. Ocean freight consolidation net revenue grew at a rate of 11% in 2008, as compared to 2007, while the other services, ocean forwarding and order management, which are primarily fee based, grew at rates of 16% and 21%, respectively.
Ocean freight consolidation volumes, measured in terms of forty-foot container equivalent units (FEUs), in 2008 were approximately equal to 2007 while net revenue per container, on an aggregate basis, increased 11% for the same period. The increase
in ocean freight net revenues is a combination of the Company’s response to changing market dynamics with aggressive sales efforts and the underlying impact of carrier capacity cutbacks on the market in general.

The Company’s North American ocean freight net revenues increased approximately 9% in 2008 compared to 2007. Over 50% of the increase in ocean
freight net revenues was a result of growth in the order management and ocean forwarding business. Ocean freight net revenues for Asia and Europe increased 17% and 24%, respectively, in 2008 as compared to 2007. These increases were a
result of continued marketing efforts and opportunities provided by customer service initiatives.

Customs brokerage and other services net
revenues increased 9% in 2008 as compared with 2007. Consolidation within the customs brokerage market has also contributed to this increase as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an
overall logistics management program. In addition, increased emphasis on regulatory compliance continues to benefit the Company’s customs brokerage offerings.


Salaries and related costs increased 9% in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of (1) the
Company’s increased hiring of sales, operations, and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and (2) increased compensation levels.

The effect of including stock-based compensation expense in salaries and related costs for 2008 and 2007 are as follows:

Of the 62 basis point decrease in salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenue for
2008, as compared with 2007, 30 basis points are the result of the decrease in stock compensation expense as a percentage of net revenue.

The remaining 32 basis point decrease in salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenue for 2008, as compared with 2007, can be attributed to productivity increases which resulted from more efficient staffing utilization.
Historically, the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the Company: offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in
a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee. Using this compensation model, changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in Company
profits. Management believes that the growth in revenues, net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in the Company’s compensation program.

Other overhead expenses increased 12% in 2008 as compared with 2007 as rent expense, communications expense, process improvement and training expenses,
and other costs expanded to accommodate the Company’s growing operations. Other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased 1% in 2008 as compared with 2007. The Company incurred legal and related expenses of $10
million in 2008 as compared to $4 million in 2007, primarily attributable to the Department of Justice’s (“DOJ”) ongoing investigations of air cargo freight forwarders and related legal proceedings as described further in Part
I—Item 3 on this report on Form 10-K entitled “Legal Proceedings”. The Company will continue to incur substantial legal costs, which could include fines and/or penalties, until these proceedings are concluded. If the DOJ and/or EC
concludes that the Company has engaged in anti-competitive behavior, such fines and/or penalties could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and operating cash flows. Despite the legal and related
expenditures mentioned above, other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively constant for 2008 as compared to 2007. This was primarily due to the continued achievement of cost containment objectives.

Other income, net, remained relatively constant in 2008 when compared with 2007.

The Company pays income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of
operations. The Company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2008 was 39.4% as compared to 40.0% for 2007.

2007 compared with 2006

Airfreight services net revenues in 2007 increased 12% compared with 2006 primarily because of an increase in airfreight
volumes. Global airfreight tonnages in 2007 increased 8% compared with 2006. Airfreight yields expended 83 basis points (a 4% increase) as compared with 2006. The Company’s North American export airfreight net revenues increased 7% in
2007 compared to 2006, primarily the result of increased market share attributable to focused sales activity. Airfreight services net revenues from Asia and from Europe increased 17% and 9%, respectively, for 2007 compared with 2006. These
changes are the result of market pricing and tonnage increases of 9% from Asia and 3% from Europe. Management attributes these tonnage increases to effective sales efforts.


Ocean freight volumes, measured in terms of forty-foot container equivalent units (FEUs), increased 15%
over 2006 while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 7% during the same period. The difference between these two rates is a result of a year-over-year decrease in ocean freight yields of 173 basis points (an 8% decrease) which
were partially offset by year-over-year increases in the Company’s fee-based order management and ocean forwarding business. The primary reason for the decline in ocean freight yields was due to direct carrier cost increases that market
conditions would not allow to be passed on in a timely manner.

The Company’s North American ocean freight net revenues increased
approximately 5% in 2007 compared to 2006. This was due to an increase in container traffic, primarily from Asia. Increases in ocean freight net revenues were primarily a result of increases in the order management and ocean forwarding
business, which were an outcome of continued marketing efforts and customer service initiatives. Ocean freight net revenues for Asia and Europe increased 6% and 10%, respectively, in 2007 as compared to 2006. These increases were also a
result of continued marketing efforts and customer service initiatives.

Customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 16% in
2007 as compared with 2006. Consolidation within the customs brokerage market has also contributed to this increase as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics
management program. In addition, increased emphasis on regulatory compliance continues to benefit the Company’s customs brokerage offerings.

Salaries and related costs increased 13% in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of (1) the Company’s increased hiring of sales, operations, and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in
business activity and (2) increased compensation levels.

The effect of including stock-based compensation expense in salaries and
related costs for 2007 and 2006 are as follows:

Historically, the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the
result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the Company: offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled
by each key employee. Using this compensation model, changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in Company profits. Management believes that the growth in revenues, net revenues and net earnings are a result of
the incentives inherent in the Company’s compensation program.

Other overhead expenses increased 11% in 2007 as compared with 2006 as
rent expense, communications expense, process improvement and training expenses, and other costs expanded to accommodate the Company’s growing operations. The Company incurred legal and related expenses of $4 million in 2007, primarily
attributable to the DOJ ongoing investigation of air cargo freight forwarders and related legal proceedings as described further in Part I - Item 3 on this report on Form 10-K entitled “Legal Proceedings”. Other overhead expenses as a
percentage of net revenues decreased 1% in 2007 as compared with 2006.

Other income, net, increased 28% in 2007 as compared with 2006. Due
to higher interest rates on higher average cash balances and short-term investments during 2007, interest income increased by $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

The Company pays income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of
operations. The Company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2007 was 40.0% as compared to 40.6% for 2006.


Currency and Other Risk Factors

International air/ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. There are a large number of entities competing in the
international logistics industry; however, the Company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group. While there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into
large firms with multinational offices and agency networks, regional and local broker/forwarders remain a competitive force.

Historically,
the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service, including reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of operations. The Company emphasizes quality service and
believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry. Customers have exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as
just-in-time inventory management. The Company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage. Accordingly, sophisticated computerized customer
service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers.

Developing
these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers. Smaller and middle-tier competitors, in general, do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide
network. As a result, there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry. Management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short- to medium-term.

The nature of the Company’s worldwide operations necessitates the Company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the U.S.
dollar. This results in the Company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference. Some of the countries where the Company maintains offices and/or agency relationships have strict
currency control regulations which influence the Company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. The Company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or
agents. The Company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the Company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the short-term financial
outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most time-sensitive way to avoid short-term exchange losses. Any such hedging activity during 2008, 2007 and 2006 was insignificant. Net unrealized foreign currency losses incurred in 2008
were $191. Net unrealized foreign currency gains incurred in 2007 were $1,300. Net unrealized foreign currency losses incurred in 2006 were $321. The Company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Sources of Growth

During 2008, the Company opened 7
full-service offices (•) and 4 satellite offices (+), as follows:

Suzhou, People’s Republic of China and Milwaukee, Wisconsin converted from satellite offices to full-service
offices during 2008.

Acquisitions - Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the
Company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill,” the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business. As a result,
the Company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions, where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the “goodwill” recorded in the transaction.

Internal Growth - Management believes that a comparison of “same store” growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the
Company’s internally generated growth. This “same store” analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the Company’s operating results for at least one full year. The table below
presents “same store” comparisons on a year-over-year basis for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $409 million, as compared with
$313 million for 2007. This $96 million increase is primarily due to increased net earnings and a decrease in accounts receivable which outpaced the decrease in accounts payable and other accrued current liabilities

The Company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality. Historically, the first
quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings. This results in positive cash flow. The increased activity associated with peak season (typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well
into the fourth quarter) causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections. This cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash.

As a customs broker, the Company makes significant 5-10 business day cash advances for certain of its customers’ obligations such as the payment of duties to the Customs and Border Protection of the Department of
Homeland Security. These advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of credit-worthy customers. Cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense. The billings of
such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable to the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities. As a result of these “pass through”
billings, the conventional Days Sales Outstanding or DSO calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency.

Cash used in
investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $59 million, as compared with $88 million during the same period of 2007. The largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures. As a
non-asset based provider of integrated logistics services, the Company does not own any physical means of transportation (i.e., airplanes, ships, trucks, etc.). However, the Company does have need, on occasion, to purchase buildings to house
staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’ freight. The Company routinely invests in technology, office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company made capital
expenditures of $60 million as compared with $83 million for the same period in 2007. Capital expenditures in 2007 included $35 million for the purchase of 48,300 square feet of office space in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Other capital expenditures in
2008 and 2007 related primarily to investments in technology, office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements. Total capital expenditures in 2009 are currently estimated to be $70 million. This includes normal capital expenditures as noted
above, plus additional real estate acquisitions and development, although to a lesser extent than in the past few years. The Company expects to finance capital expenditures in 2009 with cash.

Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $161 million as compared with $175 million in 2007. The Company uses
the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the Company’s stock on the open market. In 2008, the Company continued its policy of repurchasing stock to limit growth in issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option
exercises. The decrease in cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared with the same period in 2007 is primarily due to fewer shares repurchased. The proceeds from issuance of stock during 2008 were
also significantly lower due to fewer aggregate shares exercised, as compared to 2007. During 2008 and 2007 the net use of cash in financing activities included the payment of dividends of $.32 per share and $.28 per share, respectively.

At December 31, 2008, working capital was $903 million, including cash and short-term investments of $742 million. The Company had no long-term
debt at December 31, 2008. The Company follows established guidelines relating to credit quality, diversification and maturities of its investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity. The Company’s investment portfolio has not
been adversely impacted by the recent disruption in the credit markets. However, if there is continued and expanded disruption in the credit markets, there can be no assurance that the Company’s investment portfolio will not be adversely
affected in the future.

The Company cannot forecast the potential impact that the recent disruptions in the world financial markets and
associated credit tightening may have on the underlying global economy. Management believes that the Company has effective credit control procedures, and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems. The Company cannot
predict what fallout any of these disruptions might have on freight volumes due to changes in consumer demand or on customers’ abilities to pay.


The Company maintains international and domestic unsecured bank lines of credit. At
December 31, 2008, the United States facility totaled $50 million and the international bank lines of credit totaled $22 million. In addition, the Company maintains a bank facility with its U.K. bank for $10 million which is available for
issuances of standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no amounts outstanding on these lines of credit, but was contingently liable for $79 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees. The standby
letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers, primarily airlines, and for duty and tax deferrals available from
governmental entities responsible for customs and value-added-tax (VAT) taxation. The total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective
foreign subsidiaries, and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company were to be required to perform.

At December 31, 2008, the Company’s contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows:

The Company enters into short-term agreements with asset-based providers reserving space on a
guaranteed basis. The pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions. The Company only enters into agreements that management believes the Company can fulfill with relative ease. Historically, the Company
has not paid for guaranteed space that it has not used. Management believes, in line with historical experience, committed purchase obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2008, will be fulfilled during 2009 in the Company’s
ordinary course of business.

The Company has a Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds
of stock option exercises. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had repurchased and retired 18,161,750 shares of common stock at an average price of $17.56 per share over the period from 1994 through 2008. During 2008, 1,255,514
shares were repurchased at an average price of $39.31 per share.

The Company has a Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan under which
Management is allowed to repurchase such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 200,000,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had repurchased and retired 15,590,002 shares of
common stock at an average price of $32.36 per share over the period from 2001 through 2008. During 2008, 2,641,423 shares were repurchased at an average price of $39.69. These discretionary repurchases were made to limit the growth in the
number of issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises.

Management believes that the Company’s current cash
position, bank financing arrangements, and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future, including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other
obligations.

In some cases, the Company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange
controls. At December 31, 2008, cash and cash equivalent balances of $482 million were held by the Company’s non-United States subsidiaries, of which $65 million was held in banks in the United States.


Impact of Inflation

To date, the Company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation. Direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short- to medium-term period. Due to the high degree of competition in the market place, these
rate increases can lead to an erosion in the Company’s margins. As the Company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest rate-sensitive indebtedness, the
Company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2008, the Company did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC
Regulation S-K.

ITEM 7A — QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business. These risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes
in short-term interest rates. The potential impact of the Company’s exposure to these risks is presented below:

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company conducts business in many different countries and currencies. The Company’s business often results in revenue
billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred. In the ordinary course of business, the Company creates numerous intercompany transactions. This brings a market risk
to the Company’s earnings.

Foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the
Company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, the Company’s reporting currency, relative to the other currencies in which the Company transacts business. All other things being equal, an
average 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar, throughout the year ended December 31, 2008, would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately $40 million. An average 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar, for the same period,
would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately $33 million. This analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation. For example, a weakening in the U.S.
dollar would be expected to increase exports from the United States and depress imports into the United States over some relevant period of time, but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately $5 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions. The Company
currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the Company’s ability to
move money freely. Any such hedging activity throughout the year ended December 31, 2008, was insignificant. Net unrealized foreign currency losses incurred in 2008 were $191. Net unrealized foreign currency gains incurred in 2007
were $1,300. Net unrealized foreign currency losses incurred in 2006 were $321. The Company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007. The Company instead follows a policy of accelerating international
currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings. The majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled
within 90 days.

Interest Rate Risk

At
December 31, 2008, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $742 million, of which $397 million was invested at various short-term market interest rates. There were no short-term borrowings at
December 31, 2008. A hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10% would not have a significant impact on the Company’s earnings.

In management’s opinion, there has been no material change in the Company’s market risk exposure between 2007 and 2008.

ITEM 9A — CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Controls and Procedures

The Company carried out
an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating
Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Changes in Internal Controls

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management
and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.


A system of internal control can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance, that the objectives of the control
system are met. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, conducted an assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in
“Internal Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Based on
this assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

KPMG LLP,
an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, which is included at F-2.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007, AND 2006

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Expeditors International of
Washington, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Expeditors International of
Washington, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Expeditors International of
Washington, Inc.:

We have audited Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008 and our report dated
February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.

Basis of Presentation

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.
(“the Company”) is a global logistics company operating through a worldwide network of offices, international service centers and exclusive or non-exclusive agents. The Company’s customers include retailing and wholesaling,
electronics, and manufacturing companies around the world. The Company grants credit upon approval to customers.

International trade is influenced by
many factors, including economic and political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange rates, and United States and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, foreign investments and
taxation. Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions. The Company cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals may be adopted, nor can the Company predict the effects adoption of
any such proposal will have on the Company’s business. Doing business in foreign locations also subjects the Company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises. In addition to being
affected by governmental policies concerning international trade, the Company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries stated in U.S. dollars, the Company’s reporting currency. In
addition, the consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of operating entities where the Company maintains a parent-subsidiary relationship through unilateral control over assets and operations together with responsibility for
payment of all liabilities, notwithstanding a lack of technical majority ownership of the subsidiary common stock.

All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

All dollar amounts in the notes are presented in thousands except for share data.

B.

Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

C.

Short-term Investments

Short-term investments are designated as
available-for-sale and cost approximates market at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

D.

Accounts Receivable

The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts, which is reviewed at least monthly for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments for services. Additional allowances may be necessary in the future if the ability of its customers to pay
deteriorates. The Company has recorded accounts receivable allowances in the amounts of $14,414, $14,830 and $13,454 as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Additions and write-offs have not been significant in any of these years.

E.

Long-Lived Assets, Depreciation and Amortization

Property and equipment
are recorded at cost and are depreciated or amortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the assets’ estimated useful lives or lease terms. Useful lives for major categories of property and equipment are as follows:

Land Improvements

50 years

Buildings

28 to 40 years

Furniture, fixtures, equipment and purchased software

3 to 5 years

Vehicles

3 to 5 years

Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and renewals of minor items are charged to earnings as incurred. Major
renewals and improvements are capitalized. Upon disposition, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in income for the period.

F - 7

Goodwill is recorded net of accumulated amortization of $765 at December 31, 2008 and 2007. For the years ended
December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company performed the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and determined that no impairment had occurred.

Other intangibles consist principally of payments made to purchase customer lists of agents in countries where the Company established its own presence by opening offices. Other intangible assets are amortized
over their estimated useful lives for periods up to 15 years and are reviewed for impairment if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred.

Balances as of December 31 are as follows:

Estimated annual amortization expense during each of the next five years is as follows:

Revenues and Revenue Recognition

The Company derives its revenues from
three principal sources: 1) airfreight services, 2) ocean freight and ocean services, and 3) customs brokerage and other services. These are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements.

As a non-asset based carrier, the Company does not own transportation assets. Rather, the Company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues
by purchasing transportation services from direct (asset-based) carriers and reselling those services to its customers. The difference between the rate billed to customers (the sell rate), and the rate paid to the carrier (the buy rate) is
termed “net revenue” or “yield”. By consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power, the Company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers, while at the same time
offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves.

Airfreight services revenues include the charges to the Company
for carrying the shipments when the Company acts as a freight consolidator. Ocean freight revenues include the charges to the Company for carrying the shipments when the Company acts as a Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC). In
each case the Company is acting as an indirect carrier. When acting as an indirect carrier, the Company will issue a House Airway Bill (HAWB) or a House Ocean Bill of Lading (HOBL) to customers as the contract of carriage. In turn, when
the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier, the Company receives a contract of carriage known as a Master Airway Bill for airfreight shipments and a Master Ocean Bill of Lading for ocean shipments. At this point, the risk of loss
passes to the carrier, however, in order to claim for any such loss, the customer is first obligated to pay the freight charges.

Based upon the terms in
the contract of carriage, revenues related to shipments where the Company issues an HAWB or an HOBL are recognized at the time the freight is tendered to the direct carrier at origin. Costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this
same time.

Revenues realized in other capacities, for instance, when the Company acts as an agent for the shipper, and does not issue an HAWB or an HOBL,
include only the commissions and fees earned for the services performed. These revenues are recognized upon completion of the services.

Customs
brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination, such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the
customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies, and arranging for delivery. This is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries
in which the Company has offices. Revenues related to customs brokerage and other services are recognized upon completion of the services.

F - 8

Arranging international shipments is a complex task. Each actual movement can require multiple services. In
some instances, the Company is asked to perform only one of these services. However, in most instances, the Company may perform multiple services. These services include destination breakbulk services and value added ancillary services
such as local transportation, export customs formalities, distribution services and logistics management. Each of these services has an associated fee which is recognized as revenue upon completion of the service.

Typically, the fees for each of these services are quoted as separate components, however, customers on occasion will request an all-inclusive rate for a set of services
known in the industry as “door-to-door service.” This means that the customer is billed a single rate for all services from pickup at origin to delivery at destination. In these instances, the revenue for origin and destination
services, as well as revenue that will be characterized as freight charges, is allocated to branches as set by preexisting Company policy perhaps supplemented by customer specific negotiations between the offices involved. Each of the
Company’s branches are separate profit centers and the primary compensation for the branch management group comes in the form of incentive-based compensation calculated directly from the operating income of that branch. This compensation
structure ensures that the allocation of revenue and expense among components of services, when provided under an all-inclusive rate, is done in an objective manner on a fair value basis in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue
00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”

G.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases, the tax effect of loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.

H.

Net Earnings per Common Share

Diluted earnings per share is computed
using the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive potential common shares represent outstanding stock options and stock purchase rights. Basic earnings per share is calculated
using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding without taking into consideration dilutive potential common shares outstanding.

I.

Stock Plans

The Company accounts for share-based compensation in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123R). This accounting standard requires the recognition of compensation expense based on an estimate of the fair
value of options granted to employees and directors under the Company’s stock option, director restricted stock and employee stock purchase rights plans. This expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the stock award vesting periods.

J.

Foreign Currency

Foreign currency amounts attributable to foreign
operations have been translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, historical rates for equity, and weighted average rates for revenues and expenses. Unrealized gains or losses arising from fluctuations
in the year-end exchange rates are generally recorded as components of other comprehensive income as adjustments from foreign currency translation. Currency fluctuations are a normal operating factor in the conduct of the Company’s
business and exchange transaction gains and losses are generally included in freight consolidation expenses.

The Company follows a policy of accelerating
international currency settlements to manage its foreign exchange exposure. Accordingly, the Company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the
Company’s ability to move money freely around the world. Such hedging activity during 2008, 2007, and 2006 was insignificant. Net unrealized foreign currency losses incurred in 2008 were $191. Net unrealized foreign currency gains
incurred in 2007 were $1,300. Net unrealized foreign currency losses incurred in 2006 were $321. The Company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

F - 9

K.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income consists of net earnings and
other gains and losses affecting shareholders’ equity that, under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, are excluded from net earnings. For the Company, these consist of foreign currency translation gains and
losses and unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, net of related income tax effects.

Accumulated other comprehensive income
consisted entirely of foreign currency translation adjustments, net of related income tax effects, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.

L.

Segment Reporting

The Company is organized functionally in geographic
operating segments. Accordingly, management focuses its attention on revenues, net revenues, operating income, identifiable assets, capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization and equity generated in each of these geographical areas
when evaluating effectiveness of geographic management. The Company charges its subsidiaries and affiliates for services rendered in the United States on a cost recovery basis. Transactions among the Company’s various offices are
conducted using the same arms-length pricing methodologies the Company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents.

M.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

N.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157), supplemented by FASB Financial Staff Position 157-1, 2 and 3. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously
concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 beginning in the first quarter of 2008, except for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities for which it will
adopt the provisions of SFAS 157 in the first quarter of 2009. The adoption of SFAS 157 had no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (SFAS 159). Under the
provisions of SFAS 159, companies may choose to account for eligible financial instruments, warranties and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis. Changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings each reporting
period. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 159 beginning in the first
quarter of 2008. The adoption of SFAS 159 had no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51” (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests,
which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. SFAS 160 modifies the accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments
when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is required to and plans to adopt the
provisions of SFAS 160 beginning in the first quarter of 2009. The Company had minority interest of $17,498 as of December 31, 2008 and $17,208 as of December 31, 2007, that it expects will be reclassified to equity under the provisions of
SFAS 160.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R establishes
principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS 141R also
establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. The Company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS 141R beginning in the first quarter of 2009. The impact will depend upon the acquisitions, if any, the Company consummates after the effective
date.

NOTE 2. CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

The Company has a $50,000 United States bank line of credit extending through July 1, 2009. Borrowings under the line bear interest at LIBOR + .75% (1.25% at December 31, 2008) and are unsecured. As of December 31,
2008, the entire $50,000 was available and the Company had no borrowings under this line.

Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries maintain bank
lines of credit for short-term working capital purposes. These credit lines are supported by standby letters of credit issued by a United States bank, or guarantees issued by the Company to the foreign banks issuing the credit line. Lines
of credit totaling $22,284 and $19,067 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, bear interest at rates up to 4% over the foreign banks’ equivalent prime rates. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no amounts outstanding
under these lines and was contingently liable for approximately $79,449 under outstanding standby letters of credit and guarantees.

The standby letters of
credit and guarantees relate to obligations of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers, primarily airlines, and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities
responsible for customs and value-added-tax (VAT) taxation. The total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries, and
there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company were to be required to perform.

At December 31, 2008,
the Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants of these credit lines and the associated credit facilities, including maintenance of certain minimum asset, working capital and equity balances and ratios.

NOTE 3. INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense for 2008, 2007, and 2006 includes
the following components:

Income tax expense differs from amounts computed by applying the United States Federal income tax rate of 35% to
earnings before income taxes and minority interest as a result of the following:

The tax effects of temporary differences, tax credits and operating loss carryforwards that give rise to
significant portions of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows:

Based on management’s review of the Company’s tax positions the Company had no significant unrecognized
tax benefits as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and
various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2005. In October 2007, the Internal Revenue Service initiated an audit of the
Company’s federal income tax return for the year 2005. With respect to state and local jurisdictions and countries outside of the United States, with limited exceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax
audits for years prior to 2001. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes that adequate amounts of
tax, interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these open tax years.

The Company recognizes interest expense
related to unrecognized tax benefits or underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and recognizes penalties in operating expenses. Any interest and penalties expensed in relation to the underpayment of income taxes were insignificant for the
years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

NOTE 4. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

A.

Stock Repurchase Plans

The Company has a
Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan under which management is authorized to repurchase up to 20,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock in the open market with the proceeds received from the exercise of employee and director stock
options. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had repurchased and retired 18,161,750 shares of common stock at an average price of $17.56 per share over the period from 1994 through 2008. On February 9, 2009, the Plan was amended to
increase the authorization to repurchase up to 40,000,000 shares.

F - 12

In November 2001, the Board of Directors expanded the Company’s Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to allow for the
repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 200,000,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had repurchased and retired 15,590,002 shares of common stock at an average
price of $32.36 per share over the period from 2001 through 2008.

B.

Stock Option Plans

At December 31, 2008, the Company
has two stock option plans (the “1985 Plan” and the “2008 Plan”) for employees under which the Board of Directors may grant officers and key employees options to purchase common stock at prices equal to or greater than market
value on the date of grant. On May 7, 2008, the shareholders approved the Company’s 2008 Plan, which made available a total of 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock for purchase upon exercise of options granted under the 2008
Plan. The 1985 Plan provides for non-qualified grants. The 2008 Plan provides for qualified and non-qualified grants. Grants under the 2008 Plan are limited to not more than 100,000 shares per person. No additional shares can be granted under the
2008 Plan after April 30, 2009. Under the 1985, 1997, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 Plans, outstanding options generally vest and become exercisable over periods up to five years from the date of grant and expire no more than 10 years from the date
of grant.

Upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options, the Company derives a tax deduction
measured by the excess of the market value over the option price at the date of disqualifying disposition. The portion of the benefit from the deduction which equals the estimated fair value of the options (previously recognized as compensation
expense) is recorded as a credit to the deferred tax asset for non-qualified stock options and is recorded as a credit to current tax expense for any disqualified dispositions of incentive stock options. All of the tax benefit received upon option
exercise for the tax deduction in excess of the estimated fair value of the options is credited to additional paid-in capital.

The following table
summarizes by plan stock option activity and shares available for granting of options:

C.

Stock Purchase Plan

In May 2002, the shareholders
approved the Company’s 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2002 Plan”), which became effective August 1, 2002 upon the expiration of the 1988 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“1988 Plan”) on July 31, 2002. In May
2007, the shareholders approved an amendment to the 2002 Plan to increase by 5,000,000 the number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for purchase under the 2002 Plan. The Company’s amended 2002 Plan provides for 9,305,452
shares of the Company’s common stock, including 305,452 remaining shares transferred from the 1988 Plan, to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of purchase rights granted to employees who elect to participate through regular payroll
deductions beginning August 1 of each year. The purchase rights are exercisable on July 31 of the following year at a price equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair market value of the Company’s stock on July 31 or
(2) 85% of the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the preceding August 1. At December 31, 2008, an aggregate of 4,492,845 shares had been issued under the 2002 Plan and $11,403 had been withheld in connection with the
plan year ending July 31, 2009.

F - 13

D.

Director Restricted Stock Plan

In May 2008, the
shareholders approved the Company’s 2008 Directors’ Restricted Stock Plan (the 2008 Directors’ Plan), which provides for annual awards of restricted stock to non-employee directors and makes 200,000 shares of the Company’s common
stock available for grant. The 2008 Directors’ Plan replaced the 1993 Directors’ Non-qualified Stock Option Plan. The plan provides for an annual grant of restricted stock awards with a fair market value equal to $200,000 to each
participant. Each restricted stock award under the 2008 Directors’ Plan vests in equal amounts monthly over one year. Restricted shares entitle the grantees to all shareholder rights once vested, except for cash dividends and transfer rights
which are forfeited until the final vesting date of the award. If a non-employee director’s service is terminated, any unvested portion of an award will be forfeited unless the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines
otherwise.

E.

Stock Option and Restricted Stock Award Activity

The
following tables summarize information about fixed-price stock options and restricted stock awards for the year ended December 31, 2008:

F.

Share-Based Compensation Expense

The fair value of each
option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants issued during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006:

The Company’s expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s
stock. The expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve
in effect at the time of grant for U.S.

F - 14

Treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option, i.e. a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an option with a ten year expected
life. The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s historical experience. The forfeiture rate used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical pre-vesting employee forfeiture patterns.

The compensation for restricted stock awards is based on the fair market value of the Company’s share of common stock on the date of grant.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was approximately $61 million, $138 million and $111
million, respectively. The estimated fair value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was approximately $29 million, $28 million and $29 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of restricted stock
awards vested during the year ended December 31, 2008 was approximately $700.

As of December 31, 2008, the total unrecognized compensation cost
related to unvested stock options, unvested restricted stock awards and stock purchase rights is $94 million and the weighted average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is 3.1 years.

Total stock compensation expense and the total related tax benefit recognized for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 are as follows:

Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises, restricted stock awards and employee stock plan purchases are
issued as new shares outstanding by the Company’s transfer agent.

NOTE 5. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company’s financial instruments, other than cash, consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses. The carrying value of these
financial instruments approximates their fair value. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of purchase. Short term investments have a maturity of greater than three months at date of
purchase. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consist of the following:

The fair value of corporate commercial paper is based on the use of market interest rates for identical or similar
assets.

NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS

A.

Leases

The Company occupies office and warehouse facilities under terms
of operating leases expiring up to 2019. Total rent expense for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $54,059, $48,200 and $44,496, respectively. At December 31, 2008, future minimum annual lease payments under all leases are as follows:

B.

Unconditional Purchase Obligations

The Company enters into short-term
agreements with asset-based providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis. The pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions. The Company only enters into agreements that management believes the Company can fulfill with
relative ease. Historically, the Company has not paid for guaranteed space that it has not used. Management believes, in line with historical experience, committed purchase obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2008 of $362,354, will be
fulfilled during 2009 in the Company’s ordinary course of business.

C.

Employee Benefits

The Company has employee savings plans under which the
Company provides a discretionary matching contribution. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company’s contributions under the plans were $6,196, $6,790, and $5,814, respectively.

NOTE 7. CONTINGENCIES

On October 10, 2007, the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a subpoena ordering the Company to produce certain information and records relating to an investigation of alleged anti-competitive behavior
amongst air cargo freight forwarders. The Company has retained the services of a law firm to assist in complying with the DOJ’s subpoena. As part of this process, the Company has met with and continues to co-operate with the DOJ. As of
December 31, 2008, the Company had incurred approximately $14 million of cumulative legal and associated costs. The Company expects to incur additional costs during the course of this ongoing investigation, which could include fines and/or
penalties if the DOJ concludes that the Company has engaged in anti-competitive behavior and such fines and/or penalties could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and operating cash flows.

On June 18, 2008, the European Commission (EC) issued a request for information to the Company’s UK subsidiary, Expeditors
International (UK) Ltd., requesting certain information relating to an ongoing investigation of freight forwarders. The Company replied to the request. On February 18, 2009, the EC issued another request for information to the same subsidiary
requesting certain additional information in connection with the EC’s ongoing investigation of freight forwarders. The Company intends to respond to this latest request for information. The Company expects to incur additional costs during the
course of this ongoing investigation, which could include administrative fines if the EC concludes that the Company has engaged in anti-competitive behavior and such fines could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position,
results of operations and operating cash flows.

On January 3, 2008, the Company was named as a defendant, with seven other European
and North American-based global logistics providers, in a Federal antitrust class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court of the Eastern District of New York, Precision Associates, Inc. et al v. Panalpina World Transport,
No. 08-CV0042. The plaintiffs’ complaint, which purports to be brought on behalf of a class of customers (and has not yet been certified), asserts claims that the defendants engaged in price fixing regarding the provision of freight
forwarding services in violation of the Sherman Act . The complaint seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief. The Company believes that these allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself.

On May 16, 2008, a former employee filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California, Kingery v. Expeditors International of Washington, Inc., No. 08-02510. The original lawsuit purported to be brought on behalf of some group of current and former salaried management and supervisory employees, which the
plaintiff alleges were misclassified as exempt from overtime and meal/rest breaks under California and Federal law. In February 2009, plaintiff, through his counsel, announced that the lawsuit will not be prosecuted as a class action, but solely as
a lawsuit involving plaintiff individually. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief. The Company believes that these allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself. Further, in management’s opinion,
the lawsuit will not have a significant effect on the Company’s operations or financial position.

At this time the Company is unable
to estimate the range of loss or damages, if any, that might result as an outcome of any of these proceedings.

The Company is involved in
other claims and lawsuits which arise in the ordinary course of business, none of which currently, in management’s opinion, will have a significant effect on the Company’s operations or financial position.
