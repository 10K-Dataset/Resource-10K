PART I

ITEM 1—BUSINESS

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. is engaged in the business
of providing global logistics services. 
The Company offers its customers a seamless international network
supporting the movement and strategic positioning of goods.  The Company’s services include the
consolidation or forwarding of air and ocean freight.  In each U.S. office, and in many overseas offices, the Company
acts as a customs broker.  The Company
also provides additional services including distribution management, vendor
consolidation, cargo insurance, purchase order management and customized
logistics information.  The Company does
not compete for domestic freight, overnight courier or small parcel business
and does not own aircraft or steamships.

The Company, including its majority-owned
subsidiaries, operates full service offices (•) in the cities identified
below.  Full service offices have also
been established in locations where the Company maintains unilateral control
over assets and operations and where the existence of the parent-subsidiary
relationship is maintained by means other than record ownership of voting stock
(#).   In other cities, the Company
contracts with independent agents to provide required services and has
established over 120 such relationships world-wide.  Locations where Company employees perform sales and customer
service functions are identified below as international service centers
(*).  In each case, the opening date for
the full service office or international service center is set forth in
parenthesis.



The Company was
incorporated in the State of Washington in May 1979.  Its executive offices are located at 1015 Third Avenue, 12

th

Floor, Seattle, Washington, and its telephone number is (206) 674-3400.

The Company’s Internet
address is http://www.expeditors.com. 
The Company makes available free of charge on or through its Internet
website its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably
practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

For information
concerning the amount of revenues, net revenues, operating income, identifiable
assets, capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization attributable to
the geographic areas in which the Company conducts its business, see Note 9 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Beginning in 1981, the
Company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from the Far East
to the United States and related customs brokerage and import services.  In the mid-1980’s, the Company began to
expand its service capabilities in export airfreight, ocean freight and
distribution services.  Today the
Company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified
group of customers, both in terms of industry specialization and geographic
location.  As opportunities for
profitable growth arise, the Company plans to create new offices.  While the Company has historically expanded
through organic growth, the Company has also been open to growth through
acquisition of, or establishing joint ventures with, existing agents or others
within the industry.

Airfreight
Services

Airfreight services
accounted for approximately 37, 42, and 42 percent of the Company’s 2003, 2002,
and 2001 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses (“net
revenues”), respectively.  When performing
airfreight services, the Company typically acts either as a freight
consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment.  When acting as a freight consolidator, the
Company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that
space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly
from airlines.  When moving shipments
between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation,
the Company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the
airline which carries the shipment. Whether acting as an agent or consolidator,
the Company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing, familiarity with
local business practices, knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures,
the ability to arrange for ancillary services, and assistance with space
availability in periods of peak demand.

In its airfreight
forwarding operations, the Company procures shipments from its customers,
determines the routing, consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport
distribution point, and selects the airline for transportation to the
distribution point.  At the distribution
point, the Company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken
down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual
shipments to their final destinations.

The Company estimates its
average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3,500 to 4,500 pounds and
includes merchandise from several shippers. 
Because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean
transportation, air shipments are generally characterized by a high
value-to-weight ratio, the need for rapid delivery, or both.

The Company typically
delivers shipments from a Company warehouse at the origin to the airline after
consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets.  Shipments normally arrive at the destination
distribution point within forty-eight hours after such delivery.  During peak shipment periods, cargo space
available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of
freight shipments may occur.  When these
conditions exist, the Company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand.

The Company consolidates
individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in
cost-effective combinations. Typically, as the weight or volume of a shipment
increases, the cost per pound/kilo or cubic inch/centimeter charged by the
Company decreases.  The rates charged by
airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or
volume of the shipment increases.  As a
result, by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single
shipment, the Company is able to obtain a lower rate per pound/kilo or cubic
inch/centimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual
shipment, while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be
obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment.

The Company’s net
airfreight forwarding revenues from a consolidated shipment include the
differential between the rate charged to the Company by an airline and the rate
which the Company charges to its customers, commissions paid to the Company by
the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services.  Such ancillary services provided by the
Company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation, packing,
crating and insurance services, negotiation of letters of credit, and
preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws.  When the Company acts as an agent for an
airline handling an unconsolidated


shipment, its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid
by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer.

The Company does not own
aircraft and does not plan to do so. 
Management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the
Company to undue business risks, including large capital outlays, increased
fixed operating expenses, problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition
with airlines.  Because the Company
relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments, changes in carrier
policies and practices such as pricing, payment terms, scheduling, and
frequency of service may affect its business.

The Company also performs
breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated
airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual
shipments.  Breakbulk service revenues
also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipments.

Customs Brokerage and
Import Services

Customs brokerage and
import services accounted for approximately 37, 34, and 35 percent of the
Company’s 2003, 2002, and 2001 consolidated net revenues, respectively.  As a customs broker, the Company assists
importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required
documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the
importer, arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies, and
arranging for delivery.  The Company
also provides other services at destination including temporary warehousing,
inland transportation, inventory management, cargo insurance and product
distribution.

The Company provides
customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles
as a freight forwarder.  However,
substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to
use a competing forwarder.   Conversely,
shipments handled by the Company as a forwarder may be processed by another
customs broker selected by the customer.

The Company also provides
custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the United States,
Canada and/or Mexico.  The commodities
being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require
the Company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide
competitive service.

During 1996 the Company
established a subsidiary, Expeditors Tradewin, L.L.C., to respond to customer
driven requests for high-end customs consulting services.  The demand for these services was stimulated
by the changes made by the U.S. Customs Service in response to the 1993 Customs
Modernization Act.  Fees for these non-transactional
services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed
procedures.

There is a noticeable
trend, prompted by customer demand, to quote rates on a door-to-door
basis.  Management foresees the
potential, in the medium- to long-term, for fees normally associated with
customs clearance to be de-emphasized and included as a component of other
services offered by the Company.

Ocean Freight and Ocean
Services

Ocean freight services
accounted for approximately 26, 24, and 23 percent of the Company’s 2003, 2002,
and 2001 consolidated net revenues, respectively.  The Company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are derived
from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to
customers for ancillary services which the Company may provide, such as preparing
documentation, procuring insurance, arranging for packing and crating services,
and providing consultation.  The Company
operates Expeditors International Ocean (“EIO”), a Non-Vessel Operating Common
Carrier (“NVOCC”) specializing in ocean freight consolidation from the Far East
to the United States.   EIO also
provides service, on a smaller scale, to and from any location where the
Company has an office or agent.  As an
NVOCC, EIO contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a
fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time
period at an agreed rate.  EIO solicits
Less-than Container Load (“LCL”) freight to fill the containers and charges
lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines.  EIO also handles full container loads for customers
that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable
contracts directly with the ocean carriers. 
The Company does not own vessels and generally does not physically
handle the cargo.

Expeditors Cargo Management Systems (“ECMS”) supplies
a sophisticated ocean consolidation service. 
The Company owns and maintains software that allows it to sell ECMS to
large volume customers that have signed their own service contracts with the
ocean carriers.  As an ocean
consolidator, ECMS may obtain LCL freight from several vendors and consolidate
this cargo into full containers.  The
Company’s revenues as an ocean consolidator are derived from handling LCL cargo
at origin and from the fees paid by customers for access to data captured during
the consolidation process.


Marketing and Customers

The Company provides
flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points
of origin to ultimate destinations. 
Although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company
and the services that will be required, the foreign shipper may also
participate in this selection process. 
Therefore, the Company coordinates its marketing program to reach both
domestic importers and their overseas suppliers.

The Company’s marketing
efforts are focused primarily on the traffic, shipping and purchasing
departments of existing and potential customers.  The district manager of each office is responsible for marketing,
sales coordination, and implementation in the area in which he or she is
located.  All employees are responsible
for customer service and relations.

The Company staffs its
offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the
nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global
logistics.  Marketing and customer
service staffs are responsible for marketing the Company’s services directly to
local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection
of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and
efficient service.  The Company believes
that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its
customers, its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer
service and marketing activities, and the incentives it gives to its managers
have been important elements of its success.

The goods handled by the
Company are generally a function of the products which dominate international
trade between any particular origin and destination.  Shipments of computer components, other electronic equipment,
housewares, sporting goods, machine parts, and toys, comprise a significant
percentage of the Company’s business. 
Typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of
consumer electronics, department store chains, clothing and shoe wholesalers,
manufacturers and catalogue stores. 
Historically, no single customer has accounted for five percent or more
of the Company’s revenues.

Competition

The global logistics
services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the
foreseeable future.  There are a large
number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry, but the
number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics
services is more limited.  Depending on
the location of the shipper and the importer, the Company must compete against
both the niche players and larger entities. 
While there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward
consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational and
multi-service networks, the regional and local competitors maintain a strong
market presence.

Historically, the primary competitive factors in the
global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service,
including reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of
operations.  The Company emphasizes
quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of
others in the industry.  Recently,
larger customers have exhibited a trend toward more sophisticated and efficient
procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing
strategies such as just-in-time inventory management.  This trend has made computerized customer service capabilities a
significant factor in attracting and retaining customers.  These computerized customer service
capabilities include customized Electronic Data Interchange, (“EDI”), and on-line
freight tracing and tracking applications. 
The customized EDI applications allow the transfer of key information
between the customers’ systems and the Company’s systems.  Freight tracing and tracking applications
allow customers to know the location, transit time and estimated delivery time of
inventory in transit.

Management believes that
the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’
increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the
ongoing success of the Company.  Accordingly,
the Company has devoted a significant amount of resources towards the
maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer
demands.  Management believes that the
Company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by
other logistics services companies with which it competes.

Developing these systems
has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to
customers.  Small and middle-tier
competitors, in general, do not have the resources available to develop these
customized systems.  As a result, there
is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the
industry.  Management expects that this
trend toward consolidation will continue for the short- to medium-term.  Historically, growth through aggressive
acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the Company’s competitors
and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill”.  As a result, the Company has pursued a
strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic
acquisitions.


The Company’s ability to attract, retain, and motivate
highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an
essential, if not the most important, element of its ability to compete in the
industry.  To this end, the Company has
adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch
revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel.  The Company believes that these incentive
compensation programs, combined with its experienced personnel and its ability
to coordinate global marketing efforts, provide it with a distinct competitive
advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have generally
matched only through acquisition.

Currency and Other Risk
Factors

The nature of the
Company’s worldwide operations necessitate the Company dealing with a multitude
of currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. 
This results in the Company being exposed to the inherent risks of the
international currency markets and governmental interference.  Many of the countries where the Company
maintains offices and/or agency relationships have strict currency control
regulations which influence the Company’s ability to hedge foreign currency
exposure.  The Company tries to
compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency
settlements among these offices or agents.

In addition, the
Company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on
good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines,
steamship lines and governmental agencies. 
The Company considers its current working relationships with these
entities to be good.  However, changes
in space allotments available from carriers, governmental deregulation efforts,
“modernization” of the regulations governing customs clearance, and/or changes
in governmental quota restrictions could affect the Company’s business in
unpredictable ways.

Seasonality

Historically, the Company’s
operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a
quarterly basis.  The first quarter has
traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have
traditionally been the strongest.  This
pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors including
climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and a myriad
of other similar and subtle forces.  In
addition, this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and
diversification of the Company’s international network and service
offerings.  The Company cannot
accurately forecast many of these factors, nor can the Company estimate
accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and, as a result,
there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future
periods.

A significant portion of
the Company’s revenues are derived from customers in industries whose shipping
patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries
whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just-in-time production
schedules.  Therefore, the timing of the
Company’s revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of the
Company’s control, such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and
manufacturing production delays. 
Additionally, many customers ship a significant portion of their goods
at or near the end of a quarter, and therefore, the Company may not learn of a
shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter. 
To the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected
by securities analysts, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities
analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the
Company’s stock.

Environmental

In the United States, the
Company is subject to Federal, state and local provisions regulating the
discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of
the environment.  Similar laws apply in
many foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  Although current operations have not been
significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws, governments
are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues, and the Company
cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its
business.  The Company does not
anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control
purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years.

Employees

At January 31, 2004, the
Company employed approximately 8,600 people, 2,950 in the United States and 525
in the balance of North America, 425 in South America, 1,345 in Europe, 2,450
in the Far East & Australasia, 725 in the Near/Middle East and 180 in
Africa.  Approximately 1,150 of the
Company’s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer
service, 4,500 in operations and 2,950 in finance and administration.  The Company is not a party to any collective
bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be
satisfactory.

In order to retain the
services of highly qualified, experienced, and motivated employees, the Company
places considerable emphasis on its incentive compensation programs and stock
option plans.

Regulation

With respect to the
Company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the United States,
it is subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) as an
indirect air carrier.  The Company’s overseas
offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective
countries of operation.  The Company is
licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices, has made
application for a license, as an airfreight forwarder by the International Air
Transport Association (“IATA”). IATA is a voluntary association of airlines
which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting
as agents for its members.  The majority
of the Company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines
which are IATA members.

The Company is licensed
as a customs broker by the Customs Service of the Department of the Treasury in
each U.S. customs district in which it does business.  All U.S. customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed
records and are subject to periodic audits by the Customs Service.  In other jurisdictions in which the Company
performs clearance services, the Company is licensed by the appropriate
governmental authority.


The Company is registered
as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary by the Federal Maritime Commission
(“FMC”).  The FMC

has established certain qualifications for shipping agents, including
certain surety bonding requirements. 
The FMC also is responsible for the economic regulation of NVOCC
activity originating or terminating in the United States.  To comply with these economic regulations,
vessel operators and NVOCCs, such as EIO, are required to file tariffs
electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of
specified commodities into and out of the U.S. 
The FMC has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing
penalties.

The Company does not
believe that current U.S. and foreign governmental regulations impose
significant economic restraint upon its business operations.  In general, the Company conducts its
business activities in each country through a majority-owned subsidiary
corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country.  However, the regulations of foreign
governments can impose barriers to the Company’s ability to provide the full
range of its business activities in a wholly or majority U.S.-owned
subsidiary.  For example, foreign ownership
of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less
frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding and/or
freight consolidation is restricted to local entities.  When the Company encounters this sort of
governmental restriction, it works to establish a legal structure that meets
the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the Company the
substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the
absence of such regulation. This can be accomplished by creating a joint
venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that
holds the required license.  In cases
where the Company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the
local entity, notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of
common stock, the Company consolidates the accounts of the local entity.  In such cases, consolidation is necessary to
fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the Company
because of the existence of the parent-subsidiary relationship by means other
than record ownership of voting common stock.

Cargo Liability

When acting as an
airfreight consolidator, the Company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or
damaged shipments. This legal liability is typically limited by contract to the
lower of the transaction value or the released value ($9.07 per pound unless
the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge), except if the loss
or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate
airway bill.  The airline which the
Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the Company
in the same manner and to the same extent. 
When acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper, the Company
does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments
tendered to the airline.

When acting as an ocean
freight consolidator, the Company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or
damaged shipments.  This liability is
typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the
released value  ($500 per package or
customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a
surcharge).  The steamship line which
the Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the
Company in the same manner and to the same extent.  In its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations,
the Company does not assume cargo liability.

When providing warehouse
and distribution services, the Company limits its legal liability by contract
and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or fifty
cents per pound with a maximum of fifty dollars per “lot” — which is defined as
the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track.  Upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse
and distribution services, the Company will assume additional liability.

The Company maintains
marine cargo insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or
damaged shipments for which it is legally liable.  The Company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of
others which is stored in Company warehouse facilities.


ITEM 2 — PROPERTIES

The Company leases and
maintains 60 additional offices and satellite locations in the United States
and 131 offices throughout the world, each located close to an airport, ocean
port, or on an important border crossing. 
The majority of these facilities contain warehouse facilities.  Lease terms are either on a month-to-month
basis or terminate at various times through 2013.  As an office matures, the Company will investigate the
possibility of building or buying suitable facilities.  Lease payments currently aggregate to
approximately $2,900,000 per month.  See
Note 7 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company believes that current leases can
be extended and that suitable alternative facilities are available in the
vicinity of each present facility should extensions be unavailable at the
conclusion of current leases.

ITEM 3 — LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is ordinarily
involved in claims and lawsuits which arise in the normal course of business,
none of which currently, in management’s opinion, will have a material affect
on the Company’s operations or financial position.

ITEM 4 — SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

ITEM 7 — MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Executive Summary

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. is engaged in the business
of global logistics management, including international freight forwarding and
consolidation, for both air and ocean freight. 
The Company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices, and in
many of its international offices.  The
Company also provides additional services for its customers including
value-added distribution, purchase order management, vendor consolidation and
other logistics solutions.  The Company
does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business.  The Company does not own or operate aircraft
or steamships.

International trade is influenced by many factors, including economic
and political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange
rates, and United States and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs,
trade restrictions, foreign investments and taxation.  Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to
current tariffs and trade restrictions. 
The Company cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals may be
adopted, nor can the Company predict the affects adoption of any such proposal
will have on the Company’s business. 
Doing business in foreign locations also subjects the Company to a variety
of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic
enterprises.  In addition to being
influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade, the
Company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in
government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business.

The Company derives its revenues from three principal sources:
airfreight, ocean freight and customs brokerage and import services and these
are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements.

As a non-asset based carrier, the Company does not own transportation
assets.  Rather, the Company generates
the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing
transportation services from direct (asset-based) carriers and reselling those
services to its customers.   The
difference between the rate billed to customers (the sell rate), and the rate
paid to the carrier (the buy rate) is termed “Net Revenue” or “yield.”  By consolidating shipments from multiple
customers and concentrating its buying power, the Company is able to negotiate
favorable buy rates from the direct carriers, while at the same time offering
lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate
themselves.

Customs brokerage and import services involves providing services at
destination, such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by
preparing required documentation, calculating and providing for payment of
duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any
required inspections by governmental agencies, and arranging for delivery.   This is a complicated function requiring
technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of
countries in which the Company has offices.

The Company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly
dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including
airlines, ocean steamship lines, and governmental agencies.  The significance of maintaining acceptable
working relationships with governmental agencies and asset-based providers
involved in global trade has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing
concern over terrorism.  As each carrier
labors to comply with governmental regulations implementing security policies
and procedures, inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade
to some degree.  A good reputation helps
to develop, to the degree possible, practical working understandings that will
effectively meet security requirements while minimizing potential international
trade obstacles.  The Company considers
its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory.  However, changes in space allotments
available from carriers, governmental deregulation efforts, “modernization” of
the regulations governing customs brokerage, and/or changes in governmental
quota restrictions could affect the Company’s business in unpredictable ways.

Historically, the Company’s operating results have been subject to a
seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis.  The first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the
third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest.  This pattern is the result of, or is
influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays, consumer
demand, economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle
forces.  In addition, this historical
quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the
Company’s international network and service offerings.  The Company cannot accurately forecast many
of these factors nor can the Company estimate accurately the relative influence
of any particular factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance that
historical patterns, if any, will continue in future periods.

A significant portion of the Company’s revenues are derived from
customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to
consumer demand, and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are
dependent upon just-in-time production schedules.  Therefore, the timing of the Company’s revenues are, to a large
degree, impacted by factors out of the Company’s control, such as a sudden
change in consumer demand for retail goods and/or manufacturing production
delays.  Additionally, many customers
ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and
therefore, the Company may not learn of a shortfall in


revenues until late in a quarter. 
To the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected
by securities analysts, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities
analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the
Company’s stock.

In terms of the opportunities, challenges and risks that management is
focused on in 2004, the Company operates in 56 countries throughout the world
in the competitive global logistics industry and Company activities are tied
directly to the global economy.  From
the inception of the Company, management has believed that the elements
required for a successful global service organization can only be assured
through recruiting, training, and ultimately retaining superior personnel.  The Company’s greatest challenge is now and
always has been perpetuating a consistent global culture which demands:

•

Total
dedication, first and foremost, to providing superior customer service;

•

Aggressive
marketing of all of the Company’s service offerings;

•

Ongoing
development of key employees and management personnel via formal and informal
means;

•

Creation
of unlimited advancement opportunities for employees dedicated to hard work,
personal growth and continuous improvement;

•

Individual
commitment to the identification and mentoring of successors for every key
position so that when inevitable change is required, a qualified and
well-trained internal candidate is ready to step forward; and

•

Continuous
identification, design and implementation of system solutions, both
technological and otherwise, to meet and exceed the needs of our customers
while simultaneously delivering tools to make our employees more efficient and
more effective.

The Company has reinforced these values with a compensation system that
rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control.  There is no limit to how much a key manager
can be compensated for success.   The
Company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where
individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their
decisions.  At the same time, the Company
insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection,
cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers
from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career.

Any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a self-sustained basis
throughout the Company, provides a greater threat to the Company’s continued
success than any external force, which would be largely beyond our
control.  Consequently, management
spends the majority of its time focused on creating an environment where
employees can learn and develop while also building systems and taking
preventative action to reduce exposure to negative events.   The Company strongly believes that it is
nearly impossible to predict events that, in the aggregate, could have a
positive or a negative impact on future operations.  As a result our focus is on building and maintaining a global
culture of well-trained employees and managers that are prepared to identify
and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the Company adapt
and thrive as major trends emerge.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

A summary of the
Company’s significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 in the
consolidated financial statements in this 10-K.

Management believes that the nature of the Company’s business is such
that there are few, if any, complex challenges in accounting for
operations.  Revenue recognition is
considered the critical accounting policy due to the complexity of arranging
and managing global logistics and supply-chain management transactions.


Revenue
Recognition

Airfreight
revenues include the charges to the Company for carrying the shipments when the
Company acts as a freight consolidator. 
Ocean freight revenues include the charges to the Company for carrying
the shipments when the Company acts as a Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier
(NVOCC).  In each case the Company is
acting as an indirect carrier.  When
acting as an indirect carrier, the Company will issue a House Airway Bill
(HAWB) or a House Ocean Bill of Lading (HOBL) to customers as the contract of
carriage.  In turn, when the freight is
physically tendered to a direct carrier, the Company receives a contract of carriage
known as a Master Airway Bill for airfreight shipments and a Master Ocean Bill
of Lading for ocean shipments.  At this
point, the risk of loss passes to the carrier, however, in order to claim for
any such loss, the customer is first obligated to pay the freight charges.

Based
upon the terms in the contract of carriage, revenues related to shipments where
the Company issues an HAWB or an HOBL are recognized at the time the freight is
tendered to the direct carrier at origin. 
Costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this same time.

Revenues
realized in other capacities, for instance, when the Company acts as an agent
for the shipper, and does not issue an HAWB or an HOBL, include only the
commissions and fees earned for the services performed.  These revenues are recognized upon
completion of the services.  Similarly,
revenues related to customs brokerage and import services are recognized upon
completion of the services.

Arranging international shipments is a complex task.  Each actual movement can require multiple
services.  In some instances, the
Company is asked to perform only one of these services.  However, in most instances, the Company may
perform multiple services.  These
services include destination breakbulk services and value added ancillary
services such as local transportation, export customs formalities, distribution
services and logistics management.  Each
of these services has an associated fee, which is recognized as revenue upon completion
of the service.

Typically, the fees for each of these services are quoted as separate
components, however, customers on occasion will request an all-inclusive rate
for a set of services known in the industry as “door-to-door service.”  This means that the customer is billed a
single rate for all services from pickup at origin to delivery at
destination.  In these instances, the
revenue for origin and destination services, as well as revenue that will be
characterized as freight charges, is allocated to branches as set by
preexisting Company policy perhaps supplemented by customer specific
negotiations between the offices involved. 
Each of the Company’s branches are independent profit centers and the
primary compensation for the branch management group comes in the form of
incentive-based compensation calculated directly from the operating income of
that branch.  This compensation
structure ensures that the allocation of revenue and expense among components
of services, when provided under an all-inclusive rate, are done in an
objective manner on a fair value basis, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”

Estimates

While judgments and
estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting, the Company’s
use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas that in the
aggregate are not a major component of the Company’s statement of earnings:

•

accounts receivable
valuation,

•

the useful lives of
long-term assets,

•

the accrual of costs
related to ancillary services the Company provides,

•

establishment of
adequate insurance liabilities for the portion of the freight related exposure
which the Company has self-insured, and

•

accrual of tax expense
on an interim basis.

During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company provided full U.S.
taxation on approximately $41.9 million of foreign earnings accumulated through
December 31, 1992, for which U.S. income taxes had not previously been
provided, resulting in additional tax expense of $9.5 million.  Income taxes had not previously been
provided on these earnings as a result of the Company’s previous intent to
reinvest such earnings indefinitely or to distribute them in a manner in which
no significant additional taxes would be incurred.  The Company’s decision to provide U.S. taxes on all unremitted
foreign earnings was made based upon the desire to be able to deploy capital
globally without concern for the impact of associated U.S. tax obligations that
might be incurred as a result of the repatriation of these earnings.

Management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are
non-aggressive in approach and consistent in application.  Management believes that there are limited,
if any, alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to
the Company’s transactions.  While the
use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those
contemplated by the estimates, the Company believes that alternative principles
and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially
different results than those reported.


Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In June 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and for the
associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal obligations
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the
acquisition, construction or development and/or normal use of the asset. The
Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 beginning in the first quarter
of 2003. Adoption of SFAS No. 143 had no material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

In June 2002, SFAS
No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” was
issued which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated
with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF 94-3, “Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit
an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).”  The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS
No. 146 beginning in the first quarter of 2003.  Adoption of SFAS No. 146 had no material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45),
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” which clarifies disclosure and
recognition/measurement requirements related to certain guarantees. The
disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after
December 15, 2002 and the recognition/measurement requirements are effective on
a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.   The provisions of FIN 45 require the
Company to value and record the liability for any indirect or direct guarantees
of the indebtedness of others entered into after December 31, 2002.  The Company adopted the recognition and
measurement provisions of FIN 45 beginning in the first quarter of 2003.  As of December 31, 2003, the Company had no
material obligations under guarantees that fall within the scope of FIN 45.

In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21 (EITF
00-21), “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables’’. EITF 00-21
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under
which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities. EITF
00-21 became effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company’s
adoption of the provisions of EITF 00-21 beginning in the third quarter of 2003
had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

In December 2003,
the FASB issued revised Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities (Revised), an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,” (FIN 46R).  FIN 46R addresses the consolidation by
business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in FIN 46R.  The provisions of FIN 46R are generally
effective for public entities that have interests in variable interest entities
or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special-purpose
entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003.  Application by public entities (other than small business
issuers) for all other types of entities is required in financial statements
for periods ending after March 15, 2004. 
The Company adopted only the disclosure provisions of FIN 46R in the
fourth quarter of 2003 and will adopt the remaining provisions of FIN 46R in
the first quarter of 2004.  The Company
does not expect adoption of the remaining provisions of FIN 46R to have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.


Results of Operations

The following table shows the consolidated net revenues (revenues less
transportation expenses) attributable to the Company’s principal services and
the Company’s expenses for 2003, 2002, and 2001, expressed as percentages of
net revenues.  Management believes that
net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative
importance of the Company’s principal services since total revenues earned by
the Company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the
Company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the Company in its
other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the
Company.

2003 compared with 2002

Airfreight net revenues in 2003 decreased 2% compared with 2002.  Global airfreight tonnages in 2003 were
comparable with those in 2002.  The
decrease in 2003 airfreight net revenues was a reflection of an overall decline
in airfreight yields and an inability to increase 2003 airfreight tonnages
beyond those levels experienced in 2002. 
Airfreight tonnages and yields in 2002 were an anomaly as the airfreight
markets were swamped by cargo that would otherwise have moved by ocean, but did
not due to the disruption caused by the labor disputes in the west coast ports
of the United States.  The 1% decrease
in airfreight yields in 2003 was primarily a result of air carriers increasing
their rates such that the Company was unable to increase its corresponding
rates to customers in a timely and effective manner.  The Company elected to absorb these short-term decreases in the
interest of maintaining long-term customer relationships.  The Company’s North American export
airfreight net revenues decreased 5% in 2003 compared to 2002.  Airfreight net revenues from the Far East
and from Europe decreased 11% and increased 26%, respectively, for 2003
compared with 2002.

Ocean freight
volumes, measured in terms of forty-foot container equivalent units (FEUs),
increased 23% over 2002 while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues
increased only 16% during the same period. 
The difference in these two growth rates is a result of a 252 basis
point decline in ocean freight yields. 
In May 2003, ocean freight carriers implemented substantial rate
increases.  In order to gain market
share and maintain its focus on long-term customer relationships, the Company
chose not to immediately pass on the full rate increases.  The resulting increase in ocean freight
volumes more than offset the revenue foregone by not implementing the full rate
increases.

The Company continued its focus of offering competitive rates to
customers at the retail level, while leveraging freight volumes to


obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level.  Expeditors Cargo Management Systems (ECMS),
an ocean freight consolidation management and purchase order tracking service,
continued to be instrumental in attracting new business.  The Company’s North American export ocean
freight net revenues decreased 3% in 2003 compared to 2002.  This decrease was a result of the Company
handling more ocean shipments moving from North America to the Far East, a
market which has lower profit per container, and, to a lesser extent, from
North America to Europe, a market which has higher profit per container.  Ocean freight net revenues from the Far East
and from Europe increased 24%, respectively, for 2003 compared with 2002.

Customs brokerage and import services net revenues increased 20% in
2003 as compared with 2002 as a result of the Company’s growing reputation for
providing high quality service and consolidation within the customs brokerage
market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated
computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program.

Salaries and related costs increased 11% in 2003 compared to 2002 as a
result of (1) the Company’s increased, albeit limited, hiring of sales,
operations, and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to
accommodate increases in business activity and (2) increased compensation
levels.  Salaries and related costs
remained constant as a percentage of net revenues.  The relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net
revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained
since the inception of the Company: offer a modest base salary and the
opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating
profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee.  Using this compensation model, changes in
individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in Company profits.  Management believes that the growth in revenues,
net revenues and net earnings for 2003 are a result of the incentives inherent
in the Company’s compensation program.

Other operating expenses increased in 2003 as compared with 2002 as
rent expense, communications expense, quality and training expenses, and other
costs expanded to accommodate the Company’s growing operations.  Other operating expenses as a percentage of
net revenues remained constant in 2003 as compared with 2002.  Management believes that this was
significant as it reflects the successful achievement of cost containment
objectives initiated at the branch level. 
The ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent
upon branch level management’s ability to adhere to these objectives

.

Other income, net, increased in 2003 as compared with 2002. Due to much
lower interest rates on higher average cash balances and short-term investments
during 2003, interest income decreased by $1.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003.  Rental income, net
of applicable depreciation, of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2003, is included in other income.  The
rental income is derived from two of the Company’s properties, one located near
Heathrow airport in London, England and an office and warehouse facility near
the San Francisco, California International Airport.  Other income in the year ended December 31, 2002 includes the
$1.5 million gain on the sale of the Company’s former Dublin, Ireland facility.

The Company pays
income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as other
taxes which are typically included in costs of operations.  The Company’s consolidated effective income
tax rate in 2003 of 36.4% is comparable to the 36.5% rate in 2002.  In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company
recorded additional tax expense of $9.5 million in order to provide full U.S.
taxation on approximately $41.9 million of foreign earnings accumulated through
December 31, 1992, for which U.S. income taxes had not previously been
provided. Income taxes had not previously been provided on these earnings as a
result of the Company’s previous intent to reinvest such earnings indefinitely
or to distribute them in a manner in which no significant additional taxes
would be incurred.  Also during the
fourth quarter of 2003, the Company eliminated $8 million of certain taxes
which the Company had previously expected to pay.  Upon recent analysis of the state tax implications of the
Company’s pattern of remitting foreign earnings, the Company has determined
that these taxes are not owed.

2002 compared with 2001

Airfreight net revenues in 2002 increased 12% compared with 2001
primarily due to increased airfreight tonnages handled in 2002 as compared with
2001.  Airfreight margins decreased
approximately 2% during 2002 as compared with 2001 as a result of rate
increases initiated by air carriers during the third and fourth quarters in
response to excess air cargo demands associated with the port disruptions on
the west coast of the United States. 
Efficient consolidations of dense and fluffy (volumetric) freight
allowed the Company to optimize purchased transportation costs while still
offering competitive rates to customers. 
The Company’s North American export airfreight net revenues decreased 2%
in 2002 compared to 2001.  Airfreight
net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased 22% and 12%,
respectively, for 2002 compared with 2001. 
Airfreight rates on Far East to North American trade lanes, the
Company’s most dominant lane, remained strong throughout 2002, and were
particularly strong during the fourth quarter.

Ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 18% in 2002
compared to 2001.  Ocean freight demand
remained strong throughout 2002.  Ocean
freight rates from the Far East, the Company’s largest trade lane fell
throughout the year.   Ocean freight
volumes increased during the last half of 2002, despite a 10-day disruption in
service at the ports located on the west coast of the United States.  The aftermath of this disruption continued
throughout the fourth quarter. 
Management believes that the Company’s continued strong performance
through this work disruption is a significant indication of both the strength
of the Company’s relationships with its vendors and the expertise of its
staff.  During 2002, management
continued to expand market share, increase ocean tonnage, and increase net
ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to
customers.  Changes in the regulatory
environment in the United States continued to create new opportunities for the
Company’s NVOCC operations to provide


services to customers who had previously dealt directly with the ocean
carriers.

Margins decreased 1% in
2002 as compared with 2001 because the Company reduced rates to increase
volumes in response to an environment of falling prices which were a result of
the overcapacity situation that existed in the ocean markets.  The Company continued its focus of offering competitive
rates to customers at the retail level, while leveraging freight volumes to
obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level.  ECMS, an ocean freight consolidation
management and purchase order tracking service, continued to be instrumental in
attracting new business.  The Company’s
North American export ocean freight net revenues increased 18% in 2002 compared
to 2001.  This increase was a result of
the Company handling more ocean shipments moving from North America to the Far
East and, to a lesser extent, from North America to Europe.  Ocean freight net revenues from the Far East
and from Europe increased 21% and 14%, respectively, for 2002 compared with
2001.

Customs brokerage and import services net revenues increased 9% in 2002
as compared with 2001 as a result of the Company’s growing reputation for
providing high quality service and consolidation within the customs brokerage
market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated
computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program.

Salaries and related costs increased in 2002 compared to 2001 as a
result of (1) the Company’s increased hiring of sales, operations, and
administrative personnel in existing offices to accommodate increases in
business activity and (2) increased compensation levels.  Salaries and related costs decreased 1% as a
percentage of net revenues.

Other operating expenses increased in 2002 as compared with 2001 as
rent expense, communications expense, quality and training expenses, and other
costs expanded to accommodate the Company’s growing operations.  Other operating expenses as a percentage of
net revenues remained constant in 2002 as compared with 2001.  Management believes that this was
significant as it reflects the successful achievement of cost containment
objectives initiated at the branch level. 
The ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent
upon branch level management’s ability to adhere to these objectives

.  During the fourth quarter of 2002, the
Company evaluated the recoverability of certain other assets and determined
that an impairment had occurred. 
Accordingly, a $3.5 million loss was recorded as an operating expense.

Other income, net, decreased in 2002 as compared with 2001. Due to much
lower interest rates on higher average cash balances and short-term investments
during 2002, interest income decreased by $2.9 million.  The decrease in interest income during the
year ended December 31, 2002, was offset by a $1.5 million gain on the sale of
the Company’s former Dublin, Ireland facility.

The Company pays income taxes in the United States and other
jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of
operations.  The Company’s consolidated
effective income tax rate in 2002 was 36.5%, down from the 36.9% rate
experienced in 2001.  The .4%

decrease was caused primarily

by a reduction in state tax expense
required to be paid by the Company.

Currency and Other Risk Factors

International air/ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are
intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable
future.  There are a large number of
entities competing in the international logistics industry; however, the
Company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies
within this group.  While there is
currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large
firms with multinational offices and agency networks, regional and local
broker/forwarders remain a competitive force.

Historically, the primary competitive factors in the international
logistics industry have been price and quality of service, including
reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of
operations.  The Company emphasizes
quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of
others in the industry.  Customers have
exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the
management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as
just-in-time inventory management. 
Accordingly, sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities
and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting
and retaining customers.

Developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a
considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers.  Smaller and middle-tier competitors, in
general, do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and
a worldwide network.  As a result, there
is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the
industry.  Management expects that this
trend toward consolidation will continue for the short- to medium-term.

The nature of the Company’s worldwide operations necessitates the
Company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the


U.S. Dollar.  This results in
the Company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency
markets and governmental interference. 
Some of the countries where the Company maintains offices and/or agency
relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the
Company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure.  The Company tries to compensate for these exposures by
accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or
agents.  The Company enters into foreign
currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are
regulatory or commercial limitations on the Company’s ability to move money
freely around the world or the short-term financial outlook in any country is
such that hedging is the most time-sensitive way to avoid short-term exchange
losses.  Any such hedging activity
during 2003, 2002 and 2001 was insignificant. 
Net foreign currency gains realized in 2003 and 2002 were $588,000 and
$70,000, respectively.  Net foreign
currency losses realized during 2001 were $366,000.  The Company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at
December 31, 2003 and 2002.

The Company has traditionally generated revenues from airfreight, ocean
freight and customs brokerage and import services.  In light of the customer-driven trend to provide customer rates
on a door-to-door basis, management foresees the potential, in the medium- to
long-term, for fees normally associated with customs house brokerage to be
de-emphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the
Company.

Sources of Growth

Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a
challenge for many of the Company’s competitors and typically involves the
purchase of significant “goodwill,” the value of which can be realized in large
measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired
business.  As a result, the Company has
pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic
acquisitions, where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the
“goodwill” recorded in the transaction.

Office Additions

The Company opened 3 start-up offices and one office through an
acquisition during 2003.  The office
added through an acquisition is followed by an asterisk.

During 2003, the Company closed its Luton, England office and consolidated
those operations with the operations of its London, England office.

Internal Growth

Management believes that a comparison of  “same store” growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality
and extent of the Company’s internally generated growth.  This “same store” analysis isolates the
financial contributions from offices that have been included in the Company’s
operating results for at least one full year. 
The table below presents “same store” comparisons on a year-over-year
basis for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s principal source of liquidity is cash generated from
operating activities.  Net cash provided
by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was approximately
$114 million, as compared with $116 million for 2002.  This $2 million decrease is principally due to increased accounts
receivable, offset by increased net earnings and increased accounts payable,
accrued expenses and taxes payable. 
Increased accounts receivable is primarily due to slower collections on
certain large technology accounts required to meet current market
conditions.  Increases in accounts
payable and accrued expenses are a result of the Company’s attempts to manage
cash flows by matching the timing of cash outflows for payments to vendors with
cash inflows from collections of customer billings.

The Company’s
business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. 
Cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality.  Historically, the first quarter shows an
excess of customer collections over customer billings.  This results in positive cash flow.  The increased activity


associated with
peak season (typically commencing late second or early third quarter) causes an
excess of customer billings over customer collections.  This cyclical growth in customer receivables
consumes available cash.  In the past,
the Company has utilized short-term borrowings to satisfy normal operating
expenditures when temporary cash outflows exceed cash inflows.  These short-term

borrowings have
been repaid when the trend reverses and customer collections exceed customer
billings.  During 2003, short-term
borrowings were not required in the United States despite the intense cash flow
pressures in this market due to funds advanced in association with customs
brokerage activity.

As a customs
broker, the Company makes significant 5-10 business day cash advances for
certain of its customers’ obligations such as the payment of duties to the
Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. 
These advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of
credit-worthy customers.  Cash advances
are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and
expense.  The billings of such advances
to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable to
the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental
customs authorities.  As a result of
these “pass through” billings, the conventional Days Sales Outstanding or DSO
calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency.

Cash used in investing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $26 million, as compared
with $113 million during the same period of 2002.  The largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for
capital expenditures.  As a non-asset
based provider of integrated logistics services, the Company does not own any
physical means of transportation (i.e., airplanes, ships, trucks, etc.).  However, the Company does have need, on
occasion, to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of
customers’ freight.  The Company
routinely invests in technology, office furniture and equipment and leasehold
improvements.

For the year ended
December 31, 2003, the Company made capital expenditures of $21 million as
compared with $81 million for the same period in 2002.  Capital expenditures in 2002 included $59
million for acquisitions of real estate and office/warehouse facilities in New
Jersey and the United Kingdom.  Other capital
expenditures in 2003 and 2002 related primarily to investments in technology
and office furniture and equipment. Cash of $31.3 million was paid into escrow
during 2002 to acquire an office and warehouse facility near the San Francisco,
California International Airport; the transaction closed on January 7, 2003.  The Company currently expects to spend
approximately $33 million for normal capital expenditures in 2004.  In addition to property and equipment,
normal capital expenditures include leasehold improvements, warehouse
equipment, computer hardware and furniture and fixtures.  The Company expects to finance capital
expenditures in 2004, with cash.

Cash used in
financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $18 million as
compared with $13 million for the same period in 2002.  The Company uses the proceeds from stock
option exercises to repurchase the Company’s stock on the open market.  The differences between proceeds from the
issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock for
the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 represent a timing difference in the
receipt of proceeds and the subsequent repurchase of outstanding shares.  In 2001, the Company repurchased 2,000,000
shares at an average price of $22.56 per share under a discretionary plan authorized
by the Board of Directors.  In November 2001, the Board of Directors
voted to allow the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the
issued and outstanding stock to 100,000,000 shares of common stock.  No repurchases were made under this plan in
2003 and 2002.  During 2003 and
2002 the net use of cash in financing activities was primarily for the payment
of dividends of $.16 per share and $.12 per share, respectively.

At December 31,
2003, working capital was $370 million, including cash and short-term
investments of $296 million. The Company had no long-term debt at December 31,
2003.  While the nature of its business
does not require an extensive investment in property and equipment, the Company
cannot eliminate the possibility that it could acquire an equity interest in property
in certain geographic locations.

The Company borrows internationally and domestically under unsecured
bank lines of credit.  At December 31,
2003, the U.S. facility totaled $50 million and the international bank lines of
credit totaled $14.9 million.  In
addition, the Company maintains bank facilities with U.K. banks for $21.4

million. 
At December 31, 2003, the Company was directly liable for $0.2 million
drawn on these lines of credit and was contingently liable for an additional
$51.9 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees related to these
lines of credit and other obligations. 
The guarantees relate to obligations of the Company’s foreign
subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct
carriers, primarily airlines, and for duty and tax deferrals available from
governmental entities responsible for customs and value-added-tax (VAT)
taxation.  The total underlying amounts
due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly
recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries,
and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event
the parent company were to be required to perform.


At December 31,
2003, the Company’s contractual obligations and other commitments are as
follows:

The Company enters
into short-term agreements with asset-based providers reserving space on a
guaranteed basis.  The pricing of these
obligations varies to some degree with market conditions.  The Company only enters into agreements that
management believes the Company can fulfill with relative ease.  Historically, the Company has not paid for
guaranteed space that it has not used. 
Management believes, in line with historical experience, committed
purchase obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2003, will be fulfilled
during 2004 in the Company’s ordinary course of business.

The Company has a Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to repurchase
shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises.  As of December 31, 2003,

the

Company had repurchased and retired 5,815,182 shares of common stock at
an average price of $14.57 per share over the period from 1994 through
2003.  During 2003, 565,374 shares were
repurchased at an average price of $35.56 per share.

Management
believes that the Company’s current cash position, bank financing arrangements,
and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity
requirements for the foreseeable future, including meeting any contingent
liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations.

In some cases, the Company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign
operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls.  At December 31, 2003, cash and cash
equivalent balances of $132.2 million were held by the Company’s non-U.S.
subsidiaries, of which $44.9 million was held in banks in the United
States.  During the fourth quarter of
2003, the Company provided full U.S. taxation on approximately $41.9 million of
foreign earnings accumulated through December 31, 1992, for which U.S. income
taxes had not previously been provided, resulting in additional tax expense of
$9.5 million.  Income taxes had not
previously been provided on these earnings as a result of the Company’s
previous intent to reinvest such earnings indefinitely or to distribute them in
a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be incurred.  The Company’s decision to provide U.S. taxes
on all unremitted foreign earnings was made based upon the desire to be able to
deploy capital globally without concern for the impact of associated U.S. tax
obligations that might be incurred as a result of the repatriation of these
earnings.

Impact of
Inflation

To date, the
Company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation, nor has the
Company experienced significant difficulty in passing carrier rate increases on
to its customers by means of price increases. 
Direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short- to medium-term
period.  Due to the high degree of
competition in the market place, these rate increases might lead to an erosion
in the Company’s margins.  As the
Company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and
equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest rate-sensitive
indebtedness, the Company currently has limited direct exposure to increased
costs resulting from increases in interest rates.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2003, the Company did not have any material
off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-K.


ITEM 7A —
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is
exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business.  These risks are primarily related to foreign
exchange risk and changes in short-term interest rates.   The potential impact of the Company’s
exposure to these risks is presented below:

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company conducts business in many different countries and
currencies.  The Company’s business
often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which
differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred.  In the ordinary course of business, the
Company creates numerous intercompany transactions.  This brings a market risk to the Company’s earnings.

Foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by
estimating the impact on the Company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical
changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar, the Company’s functional currency,
relative to the other currencies in which the Company transacts business.  All other things being equal, an average 10%
weakening of the U.S. Dollar, throughout the year ended December 31, 2003,
would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately $12.9
million.  An average 10% strengthening
of the U.S. Dollar, for the same period, would have the effect of reducing
operating income approximately $10.5 million.

The Company has approximately $7 million of intercompany transactions
unsettled at any one point in time.  The
Company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage
foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging
transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations
restrict the Company’s ability to move money freely around the world.  Any such hedging activity throughout the
year ended December 31, 2003, was insignificant.  The Company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at
December 31, 2003 and 2002.  The Company
instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to
manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings.  The majority of intercompany billings are
resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course
of business are fully settled within 90 days.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2003, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and
short-term investments of  $295.9
million and short-term borrowings of $0.2 million, all subject to variable
short-term interest rates.  A
hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10% would have an insignificant
impact on the Company’s earnings.

In management’s opinion, there has been no material change in the
Company’s market risk exposure between 2002 and 2003.

Independent Auditors’ Report

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements
of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. and subsidiaries as listed in
the accompanying index.  In connection
with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited
the financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index.  These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. 
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.  Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.

Basis of
Presentation

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (“the Company”) is a
global logistics company operating through a worldwide network of offices,
international service centers and exclusive or non-exclusive agents. The
Company’s customers include retailing and wholesaling, electronics, and
manufacturing companies around the world. 
The Company grants credit upon approval to customers.

International trade is influenced by many factors, including economic
and political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange
rates, and United States and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs,
trade restrictions, foreign investments and taxation.  Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to
current tariffs and trade restrictions. 
The Company cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals may be
adopted, nor can the Company predict the effects adoption of any such proposal
will have on the Company’s business. 
Doing business in foreign locations also subjects the Company to a
variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises.  In addition to being affected by
governmental policies concerning international trade, the Company’s business
may also be affected by political developments and changes in government
personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries.  In
addition, the consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of
operating entities where the Company maintains a parent-subsidiary relationship
through unilateral control over assets and operations together with
responsibility for payment of all liabilities, notwithstanding a lack of
technical majority ownership of the subsidiary common stock.

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

All dollar amounts in the notes are presented in thousands except for
share data.

B.

Cash
Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less
at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

C.

Short-term
Investments

Short-term investments are designated as available-for-sale and cost
approximates market at December 31, 2003 and 2002.

D.

Accounts
Receivable

The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is
reviewed at least monthly for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
its customers to make required payments for services.  Additional allowances may be necessary in the future if the
ability of its customers to pay deteriorates.

E.

Long-Lived
Assets, Depreciation and Amortization

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated or
amortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the assets’ estimated
useful lives or lease terms. Useful lives for major categories of property and
equipment are as follows:

Buildings

28 to 40 years

Furniture,
  fixtures, equipment and purchased software

3 to 5 years

Vehicles

3 to 5 years

Expenditures

for maintenance, repairs, and renewals of minor items
are charged to earnings as incurred. 
Major renewals and improvements are capitalized.  Upon disposition, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain
or loss is included in income for the period.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001. Under the new rules, purchased goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to
annual impairment tests in accordance with the provisions of the
statements.  The Company applied the new
rules on accounting for goodwill and intangible assets beginning in the first
quarter of 2002. Application of the
non-amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142 did not

F-6

have a material affect on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. Goodwill amortization expense was $161 for
the year ended December 31, 2001.  The
Company performed the required initial impairment test of goodwill as of
January 1, 2002 and determined there was no impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company
ceased to amortize goodwill.  Goodwill
is recorded net of accumulated amortization of $765 at December 31, 2003 and
2002.  For the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002, the Company performed the required annual impairment test during
the fourth quarter and determined that no impairment had occurred.

In August 2001, SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” was issued which addresses financial accounting
and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.  Intangible assets with estimable useful
lives are amortized over their respective useful lives, and reviewed for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144. 
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 144 beginning in the
first quarter of 2002.  Adoption of SFAS
No. 144 had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or
results of operations.

Other intangible assets consist principally of payments made to
purchase customer lists of former agents in countries where the Company established
its own presence by opening its own offices. 
Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives
for periods up to 15 years.

Balances as of December 31
are as follows:

Estimated annual amortization expense will approximate $1,290 during
each of the next five years.

F.

Revenues
and Revenue Recognition

The
Company derives its revenues from three principal sources: airfreight, ocean
freight and customs brokerage and import services and these are the revenue
categories presented in the financial statements.

As
a non-asset based carrier, the Company does not own transportation assets.  Rather, the Company generates the major
portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation
services from direct (asset-based) carriers and reselling those services to its
customers.   The difference between the
rate billed to customers (the sell rate), and the rate paid to the carrier (the
buy rate) is termed “Net Revenue” or “yield”. 
By consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its
buying power, the Company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the
direct carriers, while at the same time offering lower sell rates than
customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves.

Airfreight
revenues include the charges to the Company for carrying the shipments when the
Company acts as a freight consolidator. 
Ocean freight revenues include the charges to the Company for carrying
the shipments when the Company acts as a Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier
(NVOCC).  In each case the Company is
acting as an indirect carrier.  When
acting as an indirect carrier, the Company will issue a House Airway Bill
(HAWB) or a House Ocean Bill of Lading (HOBL) to customers as the contract of
carriage.  In turn, when the freight is
physically tendered to a direct carrier, the Company receives a contract of
carriage known as a Master Airway Bill for airfreight shipments and a Master
Ocean Bill of Lading for ocean shipments. 
At this point, the risk of loss passes to the carrier, however, in order
to claim for any such loss, the customer is first obligated to pay the freight
charges.

Based
upon the terms in the contract of carriage, revenues related to shipments where
the Company issues an HAWB or an HOBL are recognized at the time the freight is
tendered to the direct carrier at origin. 
Costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this same time.

Revenues
realized in other capacities, for instance, when the Company acts as an agent
for the shipper, and does not issue an HAWB or an HOBL, include only the
commissions and fees earned for the services performed.  These revenues are recognized upon
completion of the services.

Customs
brokerage and import services involves providing services at destination, such
as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required
documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes
on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by
governmental agencies, and arranging for delivery.   This is a

F-7

complicated
function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the
multitude of countries in which the Company has offices.  Revenues related to customs brokerage and
import services are recognized upon completion of the services.

Arranging international shipments is a complex task.  Each actual movement can require multiple
services.  In some instances, the
Company is asked to perform only one of these services.  However, in most instances, the Company may
perform multiple services.  These
services include destination breakbulk services and value added ancillary
services such as local transportation, export customs formalities, distribution
services and logistics management.  Each
of these services has an associated fee, which is recognized as revenue upon
completion of the service.

Typically, the fees for each of these services are quoted as separate
components, however, customers on occasion will request an all-inclusive rate
for a set of services known in the industry as “door-to-door service.”  This means that the customer is billed a
single rate for all services from pickup at origin to delivery at destination.  In these instances, the revenue for origin and
destination services, as well as revenue that will be characterized as freight
charges, is allocated to branches as set by preexisting Company policy perhaps
supplemented by customer specific negotiations between the offices involved.  Each of the Company’s branches are
independent profit centers and the primary compensation for the branch
management group comes in the form of incentive-based compensation calculated
directly from the operating income of that branch.  This compensation structure ensures that the allocation of
revenue and expense among components of services, when provided under an
all-inclusive rate, are done in an objective manner on a fair value basis, in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables.”

G.

Income
Taxes

Income taxes are
accounted for under the asset and liability method of accounting.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and

liabilities

are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases, the tax effect of loss carryforwards and tax credit
carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.  The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.

H.

Net
Earnings per Common Share

Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average
number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding.  Dilutive potential common shares represent
outstanding stock options.  Basic
earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding without taking into consideration dilutive potential common
shares outstanding.

I.

Stock
Option Plans

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option and
its employee stock purchase rights plans. 
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its fixed
stock option or employee stock purchase rights plans.  Had compensation cost for the Company’s three stock based
compensation and employee stock purchase rights plans been determined
consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net earnings, basic earnings per
share and diluted earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma
amounts indicated below:

See Note 5C. for information on the assumptions used to estimate the
fair value of option grants.

F-8

J.

Foreign
Currency

Foreign currency amounts attributable to foreign operations have been
translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates for assets and
liabilities, historical rates for equity, and average annual rates for revenues
and expenses.  Unrealized gains or
losses arising from fluctuations in the year-end exchange rates are generally
recorded as components of other comprehensive income as adjustments from
foreign currency translation.  Currency
fluctuations are a normal operating factor in the conduct of the Company’s
business and exchange transaction gains and losses are generally included in
freight consolidation expenses.

The Company follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements
to manage its foreign exchange exposure. 
Accordingly, the Company enters into foreign currency hedging
transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial
limitations on the Company’s ability to move money freely around the
world.  Such hedging activity during
2003, 2002 and 2001 was insignificant. 
Net foreign currency gains realized during 2003 and 2002 were $588 and
$70, respectively.  Net foreign currency
losses realized during 2001 were $366. 
The Company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at December
31, 2003 and 2002.

K.

Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses
affecting shareholders’ equity that, under generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States, are excluded from net income.  For the Company, these consist of foreign
currency translation gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on
securities, net of related income tax effects.

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of the
following:

L.

Segment
Reporting

The Company is organized functionally in geographic operating
segments.  Accordingly, management
focuses its attention on revenues, net revenues, operating income, identifiable
assets, capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization and equity
generated in

each of these
geographical areas when evaluating effectiveness of geographic management.  The Company charges its subsidiaries and
affiliates for services rendered in the United States on a cost recovery basis.  Transactions among the Company’s various offices
are conducted using the same arms-length pricing methodologies the Company uses
when its offices transact business with independent agents.

M.

Use of
Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
period.  Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

N.

Reclassification

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the
2003 presentation.

O.

New
Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
for the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result
from the acquisition, construction or development and/or normal use of the
asset. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 beginning in the
first quarter of 2003.  Adoption of SFAS
No. 143 had no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
condition or results of operations.

F-9

In June 2002, SFAS No.
146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” was
issued which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated
with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF 94-3, “Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).”  The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS
No. 146 beginning in the first quarter of 2003.  Adoption of SFAS No. 146 had no material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45),
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” which clarifies disclosure and
recognition/measurement requirements related to certain guarantees.  The disclosure requirements are effective
for financial statements issued after December 15, 2002 and the
recognition/measurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.  The provisions of FIN 45 require the Company
to value and record the liability for any indirect or direct guarantees of the
indebtedness of others entered into after December 31, 2002.  The Company adopted the recognition and
measurement provisions of FIN 45 beginning in the first quarter of 2003.  As of December 31, 2003, the Company had no
material obligations under guarantees that fall within the scope of FIN 45.

In November 2002, the
EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21 (EITF 00-21), “Revenue Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables.”  EITF 00-21
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under
which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities. EITF 00-21
became effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company’s
adoption of the provisions of EITF 00-21 beginning in the third quarter of 2003
had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

In December 2003, the FASB issued revised Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (Revised), an Interpretation of
ARB No. 51,” (FIN 46R).  FIN 46R
addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest
entities as defined in FIN 46R.  The
provisions of FIN 46R are generally effective for public entities that have
interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities
commonly referred to as special-purpose entities for periods ending after December
15, 2003.  Application by public
entities (other than small business issuers) for all other types of entities is
required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004.  The Company adopted only the disclosure
provisions of FIN 46R in the fourth quarter of 2003 and will adopt the
remaining provisions of FIN 46R in the first quarter of 2004.  The Company does not expect adoption of the
remaining provisions of FIN 46R to have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

The Company has determined that certain entities with which it is
involved

are variable
interest entities which will require consolidation by the Company in accordance with FIN 46R, in the
first quarter of 2004.  Since these entities are already consolidated by
the Company, their consolidation under
FIN 46R is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results
of operations.

The Company’s variable interest entities are
primarily comprised of its

exclusive agent in Taiwan, which conducts the Company’s logistics
business in that area.  As of and for the year ended December 31,
2003, the aggregate total
revenues, net revenues and total identifiable assets of the Company’s variable interest entities were
less than 10% of the Company’s respective
consolidated amounts.  The Company’s
maximum exposure to loss as a
result of its involvement with its variable interest entities is estimated at $4,000 as of December 31, 2003.

NOTE 2.

OTHER ASSETS

Other assets at December 31, 2002 included $31,250 paid into escrow in
anticipation of purchasing an office and warehouse facility near the San
Francisco, California International Airport. 
This transaction closed on January 7, 2003.

During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company evaluated the
recoverability of certain other assets and determined that an impairment had
occurred.  Accordingly, a $3,502 loss
was recorded as an operating expense in 2002. 
No impairment loss occurred in 2003.

NOTE 3.

CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

The Company has a $50,000 United States bank line of credit extending
through July 1, 2004.  Borrowings under
the line bear interest at LIBOR + .75% (1.87% at December 31, 2003) and are
unsecured.  As of December 31, 2003, the
Company had no borrowings under this line.

The majority of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries maintain bank lines
of credit for short-term working capital purposes.  These credit lines are supported by standby letters of credit
issued by a United States bank, or guarantees issued by the Company to the
foreign banks issuing the credit line. 
Lines of credit totaling $14,866 and $10,284 at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively, bear interest at rates up to 3% over the foreign banks’
equivalent prime rates.  At December 31,
2003 and 2002, the Company was liable for $217 and $1,319, respectively, of
borrowings under these lines, and at December 31, 2003 was contingently liable
for approximately $50,348 under outstanding standby letters of credit and guarantees
related to these lines of credit and other obligations.

The guarantees relate to obligations of the Company’s foreign
subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct
carriers, primarily airlines, and for duty and tax deferrals available from
governmental entities responsible for customs and value-added-tax (VAT)
taxation.  The total underlying amounts
due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded
as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries, and there
would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent
company were to be required to perform.

In addition, at December 31, 2003 the Company had $21,429 in credit
facilities with United Kingdom banks (U.K. facilities), secured by corporate
guarantees.  The Company was
contingently liable under the U.K. facilities at December 31, 2003 for $1,518
used to secure customs bonds issued to foreign governments.

F-10

At December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with all
restrictive covenants of these credit lines and the associated credit
facilities, including maintenance of certain minimum asset, working capital and
equity balances and ratios.

NOTE 4.

INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense for 2003, 2002 and 2001 includes the following
components:

Income tax expense differs from amounts computed by applying the U.S.
Federal income tax rate of 35% to earnings before income taxes and minority
interest as a result of the following:

The components of earnings before income taxes and minority interest
are as follows:

F-11

The tax effects of

temporary

differences, tax credits and operating loss
carryforwards that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and
deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:

In the fourth
quarter of 2003, the Company recorded additional tax expense of $9.5 million in
order to provide full U.S. taxation on approximately $41.9 million of foreign
earnings accumulated through December 31, 1992, for which U.S. income taxes had
not previously been provided. Income taxes had not previously been provided on
these earnings as a result of the Company’s previous intent to reinvest such
earnings indefinitely or to distribute them in a manner in which no significant
additional taxes would be incurred.  The
Company’s decision to provide U.S. taxes on all unremitted foreign earnings was
made based upon the desire to be able to deploy capital globally without
concern for the impact of associated U.S. tax obligations that might be
incurred as a result of the repatriation of those earnings.  Also, during the fourth quarter of 2003, the
Company eliminated $8 million of certain taxes which the Company had previously
expected to pay.  Upon recent analysis
of the state tax implications of the Company’s pattern of remitting foreign
earnings, the Company has determined that these taxes are not owed.

NOTE 5.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

A.

Dividends

On May 8, 2002, the Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split,
effected in the form of a stock dividend of one share of common stock for every
share outstanding, and increased the authorized common stock to 320,000,000
shares.  The stock dividend was
distributed on June 24, 2002 to shareholders of record on June 10, 2002. All
share and per share information, except par value per share, has been adjusted
for all years to reflect the stock split.

B.

Stock
Repurchase Plans

The Company has a Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan under which
management is authorized to repurchase up to 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s
common stock in the open market with the proceeds received from the exercise of
Employee and Director Stock Options.  As
of December 31, 2003, the Company had repurchased and retired 5,815,182 shares
of common stock at an average price of $14.57 per share over the period from
1994 through 2003.

In September 2001,
the Board of Directors approved a Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to
repurchase

and retire 2,000,000 shares of common
stock.  As of October 11, 2001, all
2,000,000 shares had been repurchased and retired under the plan at an average
price of $22.56 per share.  In November
2001, the Board of Directors expanded the Company’s Discretionary Stock
Repurchase Plan to allow for the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary
to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 100,000,000 shares of common
stock.  As of December 31, 2003, no
further shares had been repurchased under the amended discretionary plan.

F-12

C.

Stock
Option Plans

The Company has two stock option plans (the “1985 Plan” and the “1997
Plan”) for employees under which the Board of Directors may grant officers and
key employees options to purchase common stock at prices equal to or greater
than market value on the date of grant. 
The 1985 Plan provides for non-qualified grants at exercise prices equal
to or greater than the market value on the date of grant. Outstanding options
generally vest and become exercisable over periods up to five years from the
date of grant and expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant. The 1997
Plan provides for qualified and non-qualified grants of options to purchase
shares, limited to not more than 200,000 shares per person per year.  Grants less than or equal to 40,000 shares
in any fiscal year, are granted at or above common stock prices on the date of
grant.  Any 1997 Plan grants in excess
of the initial 40,000 shares granted per person per year (“Excess Grants”)
require an exercise price of not less than 120% of the common stock price on
the date of grant.  Excess Grants under
the 1997 Plan

vest completely in 3
years, and expire no later than 5 years, from the date of grant.

The Company also has a stock option plan (“Directors’ Plan”) under
which non-employee directors elected at each annual meeting are granted
non-qualified options to purchase 16,000 shares of common stock at prices equal
to the market value on the date of grant on the first business day of the month
following the meeting.

Upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options, the Company derives a
tax deduction measured by the excess of the market value over the option price
at the date of exercise.  The related
tax benefit is credited to additional paid-in capital.

Details regarding the plans are as follows:

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions
used for grants:

F-13

The following table summarizes information about fixed-price stock
options outstanding at December 31, 2003:

The number of stock options exercisable at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
were respectively, 4,338,466, at a weighted average exercise price of $8.40 per
share, and 3,983,924, at a weighted average exercise price of $5.78 per share.

D.

Basic and Diluted Earnings Per
Share

The following table reconciles the numerator and the denominator of the
basic and diluted per share computations for earnings per share in 2003, 2002
and 2001.

For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, options to
purchase 1,797,750 shares, 76,600 shares and 66,400 shares, respectively, of
common stock with exercise prices greater than the average fair market value of
our stock for the period of $35.54, $29.58 and $26.76, respectively, were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect
would have been antidilutive.

E.

Stock
Purchase Plan

In May 2002, the shareholders approved the Company’s 2002 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (“2002 Plan”), which became effective August 1, 2002 upon
the expiration of the 1988 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“1988 Plan”) on July
31, 2002.  The Company’s 2002 Plan
provides for 2,152,726 shares of the Company’s common stock, including 152,726
remaining shares transferred from the 1988 Plan, to be reserved for issuance
upon exercise of purchase rights granted to employees who elect to participate
through regular payroll deductions beginning August 1 of each year.  The purchase rights are exercisable on July
31 of the following year at a price equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair
market value of the Company’s stock on July 31 or (2) 85% of the fair market
value of the Company’s stock on the preceding August 1.  At December 31, 2003, an aggregate of
435,252 shares, had been issued under the 2002 Plan, and $6,006 had been
withheld in connection with the plan year ending July 31, 2004.

NOTE 6.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

The Company’s financial instruments, other than cash, consist primarily
of cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, securities,
short-term debt, accounts payable and accrued expenses.  The fair values of these financial
instruments approximate their carrying amounts based upon market interest rates
or their short-term nature.

COMMITMENTS

A.

Leases

The Company occupies office and warehouse facilities under terms of
operating leases expiring up to 2013. 
Total rent expense for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $31,206, $28,147 and
$24,323, respectively.  At December 31,
2003, future minimum annual lease payments under all leases are as follows:

B.

Unconditional Purchase
Obligations

The Company enters
into short-term agreements with asset-based providers reserving space on a
guaranteed basis.  The pricing of these
obligations varies to some degree with market conditions.  The Company only enters into agreements that
management believes the Company can fulfill with relative ease.  Historically, the Company has not paid for
guaranteed space that it has not used. 
Management believes, in line with historical experience, committed
purchase obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2003 of $94,360, will be
fulfilled during 2004 in the Company’s ordinary course of business.

C.

Employee

Benefits

The Company has employee savings plans under which the Company provides
a discretionary matching contribution.  
In 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Company’s contributions under the plans
were $3,977, $3,292, and $2,937, respectively.

NOTE 8.

CONTINGENCIES

The Company is ordinarily involved in claims and lawsuits which arise
in the normal course of business, none of which currently, in management’s
opinion, will have a significant affect on the Company’s financial condition.

BUSINESS SEGMENT
INFORMATION

Financial information regarding the Company’s 2003, 2002, and 2001
operations by geographic area are as follows:

The Company charges its subsidiaries and affiliates for services
rendered in the United States on a cost recovery basis.

F-16

No single country outside the United States represented more than 10%
of the Company’s total revenue, net revenue or total identifiable assets in any
period presented except as noted in the table below.

*Represents less than 10% in the period presented.

NOTE 10.

QUARTERLY
RESULTS (UNAUDITED)

Net

revenues

are determined by deducting freight consolidation costs from total
revenues.  The sum of quarterly per
share data may not equal the per share total reported for the year.

The fourth quarter 2003 results include a
$.03 per share increase in

operating income as a result of the elimination of accruals for inter-company differences made unnecessary
by enhancements in the Company’s inter-company
automated clearinghouse technology implemented in the beginning of the fourth quarter of
2003.  In addition, the results
also include a net $.02 per share increase in additional tax expense ($9.5
million) as a result of the Company’s decision to provide full U.S. taxation on all unremitted foreign earnings
and to eliminate certain tax expense
($8.0 million) which the Company has analyzed and determined will not ultimately be paid out.
