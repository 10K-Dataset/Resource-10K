PART I

ITEM 1—BUSINESS

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. is engaged in the business
of providing global logistics services. 
The Company offers its customers a seamless international network
supporting the movement and strategic positioning of goods.  The Company’s services include the
consolidation or forwarding of air and ocean freight.  In each U.S. office, and in many overseas offices, the Company
acts as a customs broker.  The Company
also provides additional services including distribution management, vendor
consolidation, cargo insurance, purchase order management and customized
logistics information.  The Company does
not compete for domestic freight, overnight courier or small parcel business
and does not own aircraft or steamships.

The Company, including its majority owned
subsidiaries, operates full service offices (

•

) in the
cities identified below.  Full service
offices have also been established in locations where the Company maintains
unilateral control over assets and operations and where the existence of the
parent-subsidiary relationship is maintained by means other than record
ownership of voting stock (#).   In
other cities, the Company contracts with independent agents to provide required
services and has established over 120 such relationships world-wide.  Locations where Company employees perform
sales and customer service functions are identified below as international service
centers (*).  In each case, the opening
date for the full service office or international service center is set forth
in parenthesis.



The Company was
incorporated in the State of Washington in May 1979.  Its executive offices are located at 1015 Third Avenue, 12

th

Floor, Seattle, Washington, and its telephone number is (206) 674-3400.

The Company’s Internet
address is http://www.expeditors.com.  The
Company makes available free of charge on or through its Internet website its
annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on
Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable
after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

For information
concerning the amount of revenues, net revenues, operating income, identifiable
assets, capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization attributable to
the geographic areas in which the Company conducts its business, see Note 9 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Beginning in 1981, the
Company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from the Far East
to the United States and related customs brokerage and import services.  In the mid-1980’s, the Company began to
expand its service capabilities in export airfreight, ocean freight and
distribution services.  Today the
Company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified
group of customers, both in terms of industry specialization and geographic
location.  As opportunities for
profitable growth arise, the Company plans to create new offices.  While the Company has historically expanded
through organic growth, the Company has also been open to growth through
acquisition of, or establishing joint ventures with, existing agents or others
within the industry.

Airfreight
Services

Airfreight services
accounted for approximately 42, 42, and 41 percent of the Company’s 2002, 2001,
and 2000 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses (“net
revenues”), respectively.  When
performing airfreight services, the Company typically acts either as a freight
consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment.  When acting as a freight consolidator, the
Company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that
space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly
from airlines.  When moving shipments
between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation,
the Company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the
airline which carries the shipment. Whether acting as an agent or consolidator,
the Company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing, familiarity with
local business practices, knowledge of export and import documentation and
procedures, the ability to arrange for ancillary services, and assistance with
space availability in periods of peak demand.

In its airfreight
forwarding operations, the Company procures shipments from its customers,
determines the routing, consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport
distribution point, and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution
point.  At the distribution point, the
Company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into
its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments
to their final destinations.

The Company estimates its
average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3,500 to 4,500 pounds and
includes merchandise from several shippers. 
Because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean
transportation, air shipments are generally characterized by a high
value-to-weight ratio, the need for rapid delivery, or both.

The Company typically
delivers shipments from a Company warehouse at the origin to the airline after
consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets.  Shipments normally arrive at the destination
distribution point within forty-eight hours after such delivery.  During peak shipment periods, cargo space
available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of
freight shipments may occur.  When these
conditions exist, the Company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand.

The Company consolidates
individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in
cost-effective combinations. Typically, as the weight or volume of a shipment
increases, the cost per pound/kilo or cubic inch/centimeter charged by the
Company decreases.  The rates charged by
airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or
volume of the shipment increases.  As a
result, by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single
shipment, the Company is able to obtain a lower rate per pound/kilo or cubic
inch/centimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual
shipment, while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be
obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment.

The Company’s net
airfreight forwarding revenues from a consolidated shipment includes the
differential between the rate charged to the Company by an airline and the rate
which the Company charges to its customers, commissions paid to the Company by
the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services.  Such ancillary services provided by the
Company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation, packing,
crating and insurance services, negotiation of letters of credit, and
preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws.  When the Company acts as an agent for an
airline handling an unconsolidated


shipment, its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid
by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer.

The Company does not own
aircraft and does not plan to do so. 
Management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the
Company to undue business risks, including large capital outlays, increased
fixed operating expenses, problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition
with airlines.  Because the Company
relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments, changes in carrier
policies and practices such as pricing, payment terms, scheduling, and
frequency of service may affect its business.

The Company also performs
breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated
airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual
shipments.  Breakbulk service revenues
also include commissions from non-exclusive agents for airfreight shipments.

Customs Brokerage and
Import Services

Customs brokerage and
import services accounted for approximately 34, 35, and 38 percent of the
Company’s 2002, 2001, and 2000 consolidated net revenues, respectively.  As a customs broker, the Company assists
importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required
documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the
importer, arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies, and
arranging for delivery.  The Company
also provides other services at destination including temporary warehousing,
inland transportation, inventory management, cargo insurance and product
distribution.

The Company provides
customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles
as a freight forwarder.  However,
substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to
use a competing forwarder.   Conversely,
shipments handled by the Company as a forwarder may be processed by another
customs broker selected by the customer.

The Company also provides
custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the United States,
Canada and/or Mexico.  The commodities
being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business
required the Company to make significant modifications to its systems and
traditional office structure in order to provide competitive service.

During 1996 the Company
established a subsidiary, Expeditors Tradewin, L.L.C., to respond to customer
driven requests for high-end customs consulting services.  The demand for these services was stimulated
by the changes made by the U.S. Customs Service in response to the 1993 Customs
Modernization Act.  Fees for these
non-transactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for
mutually agreed procedures.

There is currently a
noticeable trend, prompted by customer demand, to quote rates on a door-to-door
basis.  Management foresees the
potential, in the medium- to long-term, for fees normally associated with
customs clearance to be de-emphasized and included as a component of other
services offered by the Company.

Ocean Freight and Ocean
Services

Ocean freight services
accounted for approximately 24, 23, and 21 percent of the Company’s 2002, 2001,
and 2000 consolidated net revenues, respectively.  The Company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are derived
from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to
customers for ancillary services which the Company may provide, such as
preparing documentation, procuring insurance, arranging for packing and crating
services, and providing consultation. 
The Company operates Expeditors International Ocean (“EIO”), a
Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (“NVOCC”) specializing in ocean freight
consolidation from the Far East to the United States.   EIO also provides service, on a smaller scale, to and from any
location where the Company has an office or agent.  As an NVOCC, EIO contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain
transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a
specified time period at an agreed rate. 
EIO solicits less than container load (“LCL”) freight to fill the
containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping
lines.  EIO also handles full container
loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to
negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers.  The Company does not own vessels and
generally does not physically handle the cargo.

Expeditors Cargo Management Systems (“ECMS”) supplies
a sophisticated ocean consolidation service. 
The Company owns and maintains software that allows it to sell ECMS to
large volume customers that have signed their own service contracts with the
ocean carriers.  As an ocean
consolidator, ECMS may obtain LCL freight from several vendors and consolidate
this cargo into full containers.  The
Company’s revenues as an ocean consolidator are derived from handling LCL cargo
at origin and from the fees paid by customers for access to data captured
during the consolidation process.


Marketing and Customers

The Company provides
flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points
of origin to ultimate destinations. 
Although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company
and the services that will be required, the foreign shipper may also
participate in this selection process. 
Therefore, the Company coordinates its marketing program to reach both
domestic importers and their overseas suppliers.

The Company’s marketing
efforts are focused primarily on the traffic, shipping and purchasing
departments of existing and potential customers.  The district manager of each office is responsible for marketing,
sales coordination, and implementation in the area in which he or she is
located.  All employees are responsible
for customer service and relations.

The Company staffs its
offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the
nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global
logistics.  Marketing and customer
service staffs are responsible for marketing the Company’s services directly to
local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection
of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and
efficient service.  The Company believes
that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its
customers, its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer
service and marketing activities, and the incentives it gives to its managers
have been important elements of its success.

The goods handled by the
Company are generally a function of the products which dominate international
trade between any particular origin and destination.  Shipments of computer components, other electronic equipment,
housewares, sporting goods, machine parts, and toys, comprise a significant
percentage of the Company’s business. 
Typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of
consumer electronics, department store chains, clothing and shoe wholesalers,
manufacturers and catalogue stores. 
Historically, no single customer has accounted for five percent or more
of the Company’s revenues.

Competition

The global logistics
services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the
foreseeable future.  There are a large
number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry, but the
number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics
services is more limited.  Depending on
the location of the shipper and the importer, the Company must compete against
both the niche players and larger entities. 
While there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward
consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational and
multi-service networks, the regional and local competitors maintain a strong
market presence.

Historically, the primary competitive factors in the
global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service, including
reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of
operations.  The Company emphasizes
quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of
others in the industry.  Recently,
larger customers have exhibited a trend toward more sophisticated and efficient
procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing
strategies such as just-in-time inventory management.  This trend has made computerized customer service capabilities a
significant factor in attracting and retaining customers.  These computerized customer service
capabilities include customized Electronic Data Interchange, (“EDI”), and
on-line freight tracing and tracking applications.  The customized EDI applications allow the transfer of key
information between the customers’ systems and the Company’s systems.  Freight tracing and tracking applications
allow customers to know the location, transit time and estimated delivery time
of inventory in transit.

Management believes that
the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’
increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the
ongoing success of the Company. 
Accordingly, the Company has devoted a significant amount of resources
towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these
customer demands.  Management believes
that the Company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently
in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes.

Developing these systems
has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to
customers.  Small and middle-tier
competitors, in general, do not have the resources available to develop these
customized systems.  As a result, there
is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the
industry.  Management expects that this
trend toward consolidation will continue for the short- to medium-term.  Historically, growth through aggressive
acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the Company’s competitors
and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill”.  As a result, the Company has pursued a
strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions.


The Company’s ability to attract, retain, and motivate
highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an
essential, if not the most important, element of its ability to compete in the
industry.  To this end, the Company has
adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch
revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key
personnel.  The Company believes that
these incentive compensation programs, combined with its experienced personnel
and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts, provide it with a
distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that
competitors have matched only through acquisition.

Currency and Other Risk
Factors

The nature of the
Company’s worldwide operations necessitate the Company dealing with a multitude
of currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. 
This results in the Company being exposed to the inherent risks of the
international currency markets and governmental interference.  Many of the countries where the Company
maintains offices and/or agency relationships have strict  currency 
control  regulations  which 
influence  the  Company’s 
ability  to  hedge 
foreign  currency  exposure. 
The Company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating
international currency settlements among these offices or agents.

In addition, the
Company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on
good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines,
steamship lines and governmental agencies. 
The Company considers its current working relationships with these
entities to be good.  However, changes
in space allotments available from carriers, governmental deregulation efforts,
“modernization” of the regulations governing customs clearance, and/or changes
in governmental quota restrictions could affect the Company’s business in
unpredictable ways.

Seasonality

Historically, the
Company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured
on a quarterly basis.  The first quarter
has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have
traditionally been the strongest.  This
pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors including
climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and a myriad
of other similar and subtle forces.  In
addition, this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and
diversification of the Company’s international network and service
offerings.  The Company cannot
accurately forecast many of these factors, nor can the Company estimate
accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and, as a result,
there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future
periods.

A significant portion of
the Company’s revenues are derived from customers in industries whose shipping
patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries
whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just-in-time production
schedules.  Therefore, the timing of the
Company’s revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of the
Company’s control, such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and
manufacturing production delays. 
Additionally, many customers ship a significant portion of their goods
at or near the end of a quarter, and therefore, the Company may not learn of a
shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter. 
To the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected
by securities analysts, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities
analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the
Company’s stock.

Environmental

In the United States, the
Company is subject to Federal, state and local provisions regulating the
discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of
the environment.  Similar laws apply in
many foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  Although current operations have not been
significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws, governments
are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues, and the Company
cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its
business.  The Company does not anticipate
making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes
during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years.

Employees

At January 31, 2003, the
Company employed approximately 8,000 people, 2,800 in the United States and 500
in the balance of North America, 300 in South America, 1,300 in Europe, 2,200
in the Far East & Australasia, 700 in the Near/Middle East and 200 in
Africa.  Approximately 1,000 of the
Company’s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer
service, 5,000 in operations and 2,000 in finance and administration.  The Company is not a party to any collective
bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be
satisfactory.

In order to retain the
services of highly qualified, experienced, and motivated employees, the Company
places considerable emphasis on its incentive compensation programs and stock
option plans.

Regulation

With respect to the
Company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the United States,
it is subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) as an
indirect air carrier.  The Company’s
overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their
respective countries of operation.  The
Company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices,
has made application for a license, as an airfreight forwarder by the
International Air Transport Association (“IATA”). IATA is a voluntary
association of airlines which prescribes certain operating procedures for
airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members.  The majority of the Company’s airfreight
forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are IATA members.

The Company is licensed
as a customs broker by the Customs Service of the Department of the Treasury in
each U.S. customs district in which it does business.  All U.S. customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records
and are subject to periodic audits by the Customs Service.  In other jurisdictions in which the Company
performs clearance services, the Company is licensed by the appropriate
governmental authority.


The Company is registered
as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary by the Federal Maritime Commission
(“FMC”).  The FMC has established
certain qualifications for shipping agents, including certain surety bonding
requirements.  The FMC also is
responsible for the economic regulation of NVOCC activity originating or
terminating in the United States.  To
comply with these economic regulations, vessel operators and NVOCCs, such as
EIO, are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to
be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the
U.S.  The FMC has the power to enforce
these regulations by assessing penalties.

The Company does not
believe that current U.S. and foreign governmental regulations impose
significant economic restraint upon its business operations.  In general, the Company conducts its
business activities in each country through a majority-owned subsidiary
corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country.  However, the regulations of foreign
governments can impose barriers to the Company’s ability to provide the full
range of its business activities in a wholly or majority U.S.-owned
subsidiary.  For example, foreign
ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions
and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight
forwarding and/or freight consolidation is restricted to local entities.  When the Company encounters this sort of
governmental restriction, it works to establish a legal structure that meets
the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the Company the
substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the
absence of such regulation. This can be accomplished by creating a joint
venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that
holds the required license.  In cases
where the Company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the
local entity, notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of
common stock, the Company consolidates the accounts of the local entity.  In such cases, consolidation is necessary to
fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the Company
because of the existence of the parent-subsidiary relationship by means other
than record ownership of voting common stock.

Cargo Liability

When acting as an
airfreight consolidator, the Company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or
damaged shipments. This legal liability is typically limited by contract to the
lower of the transaction value or the released value ($9.07 per pound unless
the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge), except if the loss
or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate
airway bill.  The airline which the
Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the Company
in the same manner and to the same extent. 
When acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper, the Company
does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered
to the airline.

When acting as an ocean
freight consolidator, the Company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or
damaged shipments.  This liability is
typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released  value 
($500 per package  or
customary  freight  unit 
unless the  customer  declares a 
higher value and pays a surcharge). 
The steamship line which the Company utilizes to make the actual
shipment is generally liable to the Company in the same manner and to the same
extent.  In its ocean freight forwarding
and customs clearance operations, the Company does not assume cargo liability.

When providing warehouse
and distribution services, the Company limits its legal liability by contract
and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or fifty
cents per pound with a maximum of fifty dollars per “lot” — which is defined as
the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track.  Upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse
and distribution services, the Company will assume additional liability.

The Company maintains
marine cargo insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or
damaged shipments for which it is legally liable.  The Company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of
others which is stored in Company warehouse facilities.

ITEM 2 — PROPERTIES

The Company owns a
214,000 square foot office building in downtown Seattle; a 150,000 square foot
warehouse/industrial office facility in Nassau County, New York; a 27,200
square foot office facility near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport; an
80,000 square foot office and warehouse facility on a ten-acre parcel near
O’Hare International Airport in Chicago; a 5,500 square foot office facility in
the Tsim Sha Tsui East district of Kowloon, Hong Kong; and a 10,900 square foot
office facility in Taipei, Taiwan.  The
Company also owns a 23,400 square foot office and warehouse facility on a
long-term renewable land lease at the Brussels Cargo facility in Brussels,
Belgium, and an 85,000 square foot office and warehouse facility in Dublin,
Ireland.

During 2002, the Company
acquired a 224,000 square foot office and warehouse facility on a 10.5 acre
parcel in Middlesex County, New Jersey and a 15 acre parcel near Heathrow
Airport in London.  In January 2003, the
Company completed the purchase of a 320,000 square foot office and warehouse
facility on 13.22 acres near the San Francisco, California International
Airport.


The Company leases and
maintains 60 additional offices and satellite locations in the United States
and 124 offices throughout the world, each located close to an airport, ocean
port, or on an important border crossing. 
The majority of these facilities contain warehouse facilities.  Lease terms are either on a month-to-month
basis or terminate at various times through 2013.  As an office matures, the Company will investigate the possibility
of building or buying suitable facilities. 
Lease payments currently aggregate to approximately $2,648,000 per
month.  See Note 7 to the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements.  The
Company believes that current leases can be extended and that suitable
alternative facilities are available in the vicinity of each present facility
should extensions be unavailable at the conclusion of current leases.

ITEM 3 — LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is ordinarily
involved in claims and lawsuits which arise in the normal course of business,
none of which currently, in management’s opinion, will have a significant
effect on the Company’s financial position.

ITEM 4 — SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

ITEM 7 — MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. is engaged in the business
of global logistics management, including international freight forwarding and
consolidation, for both air and ocean freight. 
The Company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices, and in
many of its international offices.  The
Company also provides additional services for its customers including value
added distribution, purchase order management, vendor consolidation and other
logistics solutions.  The Company offers
domestic forwarding services only in conjunction with international
shipments.  The Company does not compete
for overnight courier or small parcel business.  The Company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships.

International trade is influenced by many factors, including economic
and political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange
rates, and United States and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs,
trade restrictions, foreign investments and taxation.  Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to
current tariffs and trade restrictions. 
The Company cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals may be
adopted, nor can the Company predict the effects adoption of any such proposal
will have on the Company’s business. 
Doing business in foreign locations also subjects the Company to a
variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic
enterprises.  In addition to being
affected by governmental policies concerning international trade, the Company’s
business may also be affected by political developments and changes in
government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business.

The Company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly
dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including
airlines, ocean steamship lines, and governmental agencies.  The Company considers its current working
relationships with these entities to be satisfactory.  However, changes in space allotments available from carriers,
governmental deregulation efforts, “modernization” of the regulations governing
customs brokerage, and/or changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect
the Company’s business in unpredictable ways.

Historically, the Company’s operating results have been subject to a
seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis.  The first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the
third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest.  This pattern is the result of, or is
influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays, consumer
demand, economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle
forces.  In addition, this historical
quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the
Company’s international network and service offerings.  The Company cannot accurately forecast many
of these factors nor can the Company estimate accurately the relative influence
of any particular factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance that
historical patterns, if any, will continue in future periods.

A significant portion of the Company’s revenues are derived from
customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to
consumer demand, and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are
dependent upon just-in-time production schedules.  Therefore, the timing of the Company’s revenues are, to a large
degree, impacted by factors out of the Company’s control, such as a sudden
change in consumer demand for retail goods and/or manufacturing production
delays.  Additionally, many customers
ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and
therefore, the Company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a
quarter.  To the extent that a shortfall
in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts, any such
shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate
and adverse effect on the trading price of the Company’s stock.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

A summary of the
Company’s significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 in the
consolidated financial statements in this 10K.

Management believes that the nature of the Company’s business is such
that there are few, if any, complex challenges in accounting for
operations.  Revenue recognition is
considered the critical accounting policy due to the complexity of arranging
and managing global logistics and supply-chain management transactions.


Revenue Recognition

The Company derives its revenues from
three principal sources: airfreight, ocean freight and customs brokerage and
import services and these are the revenue categories presented in the financial
statements.

As a non-asset based carrier, the Company does not own transportation
assets.  Rather, the Company generates
the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing
transportation services from direct (asset-based) carriers and reselling those
services to its customers.   The
difference between the rate billed to customers (the sell rate), and the rate
paid to the carrier (the buy rate) is termed “Net Revenue” or “yield”.  By consolidating shipments from multiple
customers and concentrating its buying power, the Company is able to negotiate
favorable buy rates from the direct carriers, while at the same time offering
lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate
themselves.

Airfreight revenues include the charges to the Company for carrying the
shipments when the Company acts as a freight consolidator.  Ocean freight revenues include the charges
to the Company for carrying the shipments when the Company acts as a Non-Vessel
Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC).  In
each case the Company is acting as an indirect carrier.  When acting as an indirect carrier, the
Company will issue a House Airway Bill (HAWB) or a House Ocean Bill of Lading
(HOBL) to customers as the contract of carriage.  In turn, when the freight is physically tendered to a direct
carrier, the Company receives a contract of carriage known as a Master Airway
Bill for airfreight shipments and a Master Ocean Bill of Lading for ocean
shipments.  At this point, the risk of
loss passes to the carrier, however, in order to claim for any such loss, the
customer is first obligated to pay the freight charges.

Based upon the terms in the contract of carriage, revenues related to
shipments where the Company issues an HAWB or an HOBL are recognized at the
time the freight is tendered to the direct carrier at origin.  Costs related to the shipments are also
recognized at this same time.

Revenues realized in other capacities, for instance, when the Company
acts as an agent for the shipper, and does not issue an HAWB or an HOBL,
include only the commissions and fees earned for the services performed.  These revenues are recognized upon
completion of the services.

Customs brokerage and import services involves providing services at
destination, such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by
preparing required documentation, calculating and providing for payment of
duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any
required inspections by governmental agencies, and arranging for delivery.   This is a complicated function requiring
technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of
countries in which the Company has offices. 
Revenues related to customs brokerage and import services are recognized
upon completion of the services.

Arranging international shipments is a complex task.  Each actual movement can require multiple
services.  In some instances, the
Company is asked to perform only one of these services.  However, in most instances, the Company may
perform multiple services.  These
services include destination breakbulk services and value added ancillary services
such as local transportation, export customs formalities, distribution services
and logistics management.  Each of these
services has an associated fee, which is recognized as revenue upon completion
of the service.

Typically, the fees for each of these services are quoted as separate
components, however, customers on occasion will request an all-inclusive rate
for a set of services known in the industry as “door-to-door service.”  This means that the customer is billed a
single rate for all services from pickup at origin to delivery at destination.  In these instances, the revenue for origin
and destination services, as well as revenue that will be characterized as
freight charges, is allocated to branches as set by preexisting Company policy
perhaps supplemented by customer specific negotiations between the offices
involved.  Each of the Company’s
branches are independent profit centers and the primary compensation for the
branch management group comes in the form of incentive-based compensation
calculated directly from the operating income of that branch.  This compensation structure ensures that the
allocation of revenue and expense among components of services, when provided
under an all-inclusive rate, are done in an objective manner on a fair value
basis, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables.”

While judgments and
estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting, the Company’s
use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas that in the
aggregate are not a major component of the Company’s statement of earnings:

•

accounts receivable
valuation,

•

the useful lives of
long-term assets,

•

the accrual of costs
related to ancillary services the Company provides, and

•

establishment of
adequate insurance liabilities for the portion of the freight related exposure
which the Company has self insured.

In addition, certain undistributed earnings of the Company’s
subsidiaries accumulated through December 31, 1992 would, under most
circumstances, be subject to some additional United States income tax if
distributed to the Company.  The Company
has not provided


for this additional income tax because the Company intends to reinvest
such earnings to fund the expansion of its foreign activities, or to distribute
them in a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be
incurred.

Management believes
that the methods utilized in all of these areas are non-aggressive in approach
and consistent in application. 
Management believes that there are limited, if any, alternative
accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the Company’s
transactions.  While the use of
estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated
by the estimates, the Company believes that alternative principles and methods
used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results
than those reported.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001. Under the new rules, purchased goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to
annual impairment tests in accordance with the provisions of the statements.
Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their
respective useful lives, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”.  The Company applied the new rules on
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of
2002. Application of the
non-amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142 did not have a material effect on
the Company’s financial statements. The Company performed the required initial
impairment test of goodwill as of January 1, 2002 and determined there was no
impact on the consolidated earnings and financial position of the Company at
that time.  For the year ended December
31, 2002, the Company performed the required annual impairment test during the
fourth quarter and determined that no impairment had occurred.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
for the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal obligations
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the
acquisition, construction or development and/or normal use of the asset. The
Company is required and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 143 beginning
in the first quarter of 2003. 
Management does not anticipate that adoption of SFAS No. 143 will result
in a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or
results of operations.

In August 2001, SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets” was issued which addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. While this
standard supersedes SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,” it retains many of the
fundamental provisions of that standard. SFAS No. 144 also supersedes the
accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the
Results of Operations – Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions,” for the disposal of a segment of a business. The Company adopted
the provisions of SFAS No. 144 beginning in the first quarter of 2002.  Adoption of SFAS No. 144 had no impact on
the consolidated earnings and financial position of the Company.

In November 2001, the FASB staff issued Topic D-103 (subsequently
recharacterized as EITF 01-14), “Income Statement Characterization of
Reimbursements Received for ‘Out of Pocket’ Expenses Incurred.”  This staff announcement clarified certain
provisions of EITF 99-19 “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as
an Agent,” and among other things established when reimbursements are required
to be shown gross as opposed to net. 
EITF 01-14 also directed that the new rules should be applied in
financial reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2001.  The clarifying rules now require the Company
to henceforth report certain reimbursed incidental activities on a gross rather
than net basis.  The Company has
reclassified amounts in the 2001 and 2000 presentations to conform with the
current presentation.


The following schedule shows the financial statement impact of the
adoption by comparing the net amounts in the report on Form 10K filed on or
about March 29, 2002, with the gross amounts reported in this current 10K.

There is no impact on net revenue, nor is there any
impact on operating income or net earnings as a result of this change.

In June 2002, SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit
or Disposal Activities” was issued which addresses financial accounting and
reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies
EITF 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and
Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring).”  The Company is
required and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 146 beginning in the
first quarter of 2003.  Management does
not anticipate that adoption of SFAS No. 146 will result in a significant
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45),
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” which clarifies disclosure and
recognition/measurement requirements related to certain guarantees. The
disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after
December 15, 2002 and the recognition/measurement requirements are effective on
a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.   The provisions of FIN 45 require the
Company to value and record the liability for any indirect or direct guarantees
of the indebtedness of others entered into after December 31, 2002.  The Company does not expect compliance with FIN
45 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results
of operations.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure” which amends SFAS No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide alternative methods
of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation.  SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No.
123 to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial
statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation
and the effect of the method used on reported results.  The transition guidance and annual
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 2002.  The interim
disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial
statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002.  As the Company did not make a voluntary
change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation in 2002, the adoption of SFAS No. 148 did not have an impact on
the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.  The Company has adopted the annual disclosure
provisions of SFAS No. 148 in its financial reports for the year ended December
31, 2002 and will adopt the interim disclosure provisions for its financial
reports beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2003.


Results of Operations

The following table shows the consolidated net revenues (revenues less
transportation expenses) attributable to the Company’s principal services and
the Company’s expenses for 2002, 2001, and 2000, expressed as percentages of
net revenues.  Management believes that
net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative
importance of the Company’s principal services since total revenues earned by
the Company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the
Company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the Company in its
other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the
Company.

2002 compared with 2001

Airfreight net revenues in 2002 increased 12% compared with 2001
primarily due to increased airfreight tonnages handled in 2002 as compared with
2001.  Airfreight margins decreased
approximately 2% during 2002 as compared with 2001 as a result of rate
increases initiated by air carriers during the third and fourth quarters in
response to excess air cargo demands associated with the west coast port
disruptions.  Efficient consolidations
of dense and fluffy (volumetric) freight allowed the Company to optimize
purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates to
customers.  The Company’s North American
export airfreight net revenues decreased 2% in 2002 compared to 2001.  Airfreight net revenues from the Far East
and from Europe increased 22% and 12%, respectively, for 2002 compared with
2001.  Airfreight rates on Far East to
North American trade lanes, the Company’s most dominant lane, remained strong
throughout 2002, and were particularly strong during the fourth quarter.

Ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 18% in 2002
compared to 2001.  Ocean freight demand
remained strong throughout 2002.  Ocean
freight rates from the Far East, the Company’s largest trade lane fell
throughout the year.   Ocean freight
volumes increased during the last half of 2002, despite a 10-day disruption in
service at the ports located on the west coast of the United States.  The aftermath of this disruption continued
throughout the fourth quarter. 
Management believes that the Company’s continued strong performance
through this work disruption is a significant indication of both the strength
of the Company’s relationships with its vendors and the expertise of its
staff.  During 2002, management
continued to expand market share, increase ocean tonnage, and increase net
ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to customers.  Changes in the regulatory environment in the
United States continued to create new opportunities for the Company’s NVOCC
operations to provide services to customers who had previously dealt directly
with the ocean carriers.


Margins decreased 1% in
2002 as compared with 2001 because the Company reduced rates to increase
volumes in response to an environment of falling prices which were a result of
the overcapacity situation that existed in the ocean markets.  The Company continued its focus of offering
competitive rates to customers at the retail level, while leveraging freight
volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level.  Expeditors Cargo Management Systems (ECMS),
a PC-based ocean freight consolidation management and purchase order tracking
service, continued to be instrumental in attracting new business.  The Company’s North American export ocean
freight net revenues increased 18% in 2002 compared to 2001.  This increase was a result of the Company
handling more ocean shipments moving from North America to the Far East and, to
a lesser extent, from North America to Europe. 
Ocean freight net revenues from the Far East and from Europe increased
21% and 14%, respectively, for 2002 compared with 2001.

Customs brokerage and import services net revenues increased 9% in 2002
as compared with 2001 as a result of the Company’s growing reputation for
providing high quality service and consolidation within the customs brokerage
market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized
capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program.

Salaries and related costs increased in 2002 compared to 2001 as a
result of (1) the Company’s increased hiring of sales, operations, and
administrative personnel in existing offices to accommodate increases in
business activity and (2) increased compensation levels.  Salaries and related costs decreased 1% as a
percentage of net revenues.  The relatively
consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a
compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the
Company: offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and
determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled
by each key employee.  Using this
compensation model, changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion
to changes in Company profits. 
Management believes that the growth in revenues, net revenues and net
earnings for 2002 are a result of the incentives inherent in the Company’s
compensation program.

Other operating expenses increased in 2002 as compared with 2001 as
rent expense, communications expense, quality and training expenses, and other
costs expanded to accommodate the Company’s growing operations.  Other operating expenses as a percentage of
net revenues remained constant in 2002 as compared with 2001.  Management believes that this was
significant as it reflects the successful achievement of cost containment objectives
initiated at the branch level.  The
ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent upon branch
level management’s ability to adhere to these objectives

.  During the fourth quarter of 2002, the
Company evaluated the recoverability of certain other assets and determined that
an impairment had occurred. 
Accordingly, a $3.5 million loss was recorded as an operating expense.

Other income, net, decreased in 2002 as compared with 2001. Due to much
lower interest rates on higher average cash balances and short-term investments
during 2002, interest income decreased by $2.9 million.  The decrease in interest income during the
year ended December 31, 2002, was offset by a $1.5 million gain on the sale of
the Company’s former Dublin, Ireland facility.

The Company pays income taxes in the United States and other
jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of
operations.  The Company’s consolidated
effective income tax rate in 2002 was 36.8%, down marginally from the 37% rate
experienced in the

prior year.  The .2%

decrease
was caused primarily

by a
reduction in state tax expense required to be paid by the Company.

2001 compared with 2000

Airfreight net revenues in 2001 increased 13% compared with 2000
primarily due to the Company’s ability to expand airfreight margins despite the
lower airfreight tonnages, experienced in 2001 compared with 2000.  Airfreight margins expanded approximately 5%
during 2001 as compared with 2000 despite a 9% drop in worldwide airfreight
tonnage in 2001.  Efficient consolidations
of dense and fluffy (volumetric) freight allowed the Company to optimize
purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates to
customers.  The Company’s North American
export airfreight net revenues increased 4% in 2001 compared to 2000.  Airfreight net revenues from the Far East
and from Europe increased 24% and 5%, respectively, for 2001 compared with
2000.  Airfreight rates on Far East to
North American trade lanes, the Company’s most dominant lane, remained strong
throughout 2001.

Ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 21% in 2001
compared to 2000.  Ocean freight demand
remained strong throughout 2001 and ocean freight rates from the Far East, the
Company’s largest trade lane, increased in the last half of the year.  During 2001, management continued to expand
market share, increase ocean tonnage, and increase net ocean freight revenues
while offering competitive market rates to customers.  Changes in the regulatory environment in the United States
created new opportunities for the Company’s NVOCC operations to provide
services to customers who had previously dealt directly with the ocean
carriers.

Margins increased 3% in
2001 as compared with 2000 reflecting the Company’s ability to offer
competitive rates to customers at the retail level, while leveraging freight
volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level.  ECMS continued to be instrumental in
attracting new business.  The Company’s
North American export ocean freight net revenues increased 10% in 2001 compared
to 2000.  This increase was a result of
the Company handling more ocean shipments moving from North America to the Far
East and, to a lesser extent, from North America to Europe.  Ocean freight net revenues from the Far East
and from Europe increased


23% and 30%, respectively, for 2001 compared with 2000.

Customs brokerage and import services revenues increased 3% in 2001 as
compared with 2000 as a result of (1) the Company’s growing reputation for
providing high quality service, (2) consolidation within the customs brokerage
market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated
computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program,
and (3) the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and
distinct service offered to existing and potential customers.  Distribution services accounted for nearly
36% of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for 2001
compared with 2000.

Salaries and related costs increased in 2001 compared to 2000 as a
result of (1) the Company’s increased hiring of sales, operations, and
administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases
in business activity and (2) increased compensation levels.  Salaries and related costs increased 1% as a
percentage of net revenues.  The
relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the
result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the
inception of the Company: offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to
share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the
business unit controlled by each key employee. 
Using this compensation model, changes in individual compensation will
occur in proportion to changes in Company profits.  Management believes that the growth in revenues, net revenues and
net earnings for 2001 are a result of the incentives inherent in the Company’s
compensation program.

Other operating expenses increased in 2001 as compared with 2000 as
rent expense, communications expense, quality and training expenses, and other
costs expanded to accommodate the Company’s growing operations.  Other operating expenses as a percentage of
net revenues decreased 2% in 2001 as compared with 2000.  Management believes that this decrease was
significant as it reflects the successful achievement of cost containment
objectives initiated at the branch level. 
The ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent
upon branch level management’s ability to adhere to these objectives

.

Other income, net, increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 primarily due
to interest income earned on higher cash balances and short-term investments in
2001.  Management attributes higher cash
balances, in large part, to the success of cash management and billing
improvement initiatives.

The Company pays income taxes in the United States and other
jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of
operations.  The Company’s consolidated
effective income tax rate in 2001 was 37%, down marginally from the 37.7% rate
experienced in the

prior
year.  The .7%

decrease was caused primarily

by a reduction in state tax expense required to be paid by
the Company.

Currency and Other Risk Factors

International air/ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are
intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable
future.  There are a large number of
entities competing in the international logistics industry; however, the
Company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of
companies within this group.  While
there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into
large firms with multinational offices and agency networks, regional and local
broker/forwarders remain a competitive force.

Historically, the primary competitive factors in the international
logistics industry have been price and quality of service, including
reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of
operations.  The Company emphasizes
quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of
others in the industry.  Customers have
exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the
management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as
just-in-time inventory management. 
Accordingly, sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities
and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting
and retaining customers.

Developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a
considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers.  Smaller and middle-tier competitors, in
general, do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and
a worldwide network.  As a result, there
is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the
industry.  Management expects that this
trend toward consolidation will continue for the short- to medium-term.

The nature of the Company’s worldwide operations necessitates the
Company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.  This results in the Company being exposed to
the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental
interference.  Some of the countries
where the Company maintains offices and/or agency relationships have strict
currency control regulations which influence the Company’s ability to hedge
foreign currency exposure.  The Company
tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency
settlements among its offices or agents. 
The Company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in
limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the
Company’s ability to move


money freely around the world or the short-term financial outlook in
any country is such that hedging is the most time-sensitive way to avoid
short-term exchange losses.  Any such
hedging activity during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was insignificant.  Net foreign currency gains realized in 2002
were $70,000.  Net foreign currency
losses realized during 2001 were $366,000. 
Net foreign currency gains realized during 2000 were $309,000.

The Company has traditionally generated revenues from airfreight, ocean
freight and customs brokerage and import services.  In light of the customer-driven trend to provide customer rates
on a door-to-door basis, management foresees the potential, in the medium- to
long-term, for fees normally associated with customs house brokerage to be
de-emphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the
Company.

On January 1, 1999, eleven of fifteen member countries of the European
Union, later joined by Greece in January 2001, established fixed conversion
rates between their existing currencies (“legacy currencies”) and a new common
currency - the Euro.  The Euro trades on
currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions.  The conversion to the Euro eliminates
currency exchange rate risk between the member countries.  Beginning in January 2002, new
Euro-denominated bills and coins were issued and legacy currencies began to be
withdrawn from circulation. The Company has worked diligently to address the
issues raised by the Euro currency conversion including the need to adapt
computer systems and business processes to accommodate Euro-denominated
transactions.  The conversion costs were
not material. The Company is unable to predict the resulting impact, if any, on
the Company’s consolidated financial statements of the change to one common
currency within the European Union.  
The Company has not experienced any significant disruption as a result
of this phased conversion.

Sources of Growth

Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a
challenge for many of the Company’s competitors and typically involves the
purchase of significant “goodwill,” the value of which can be realized in large
measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired
business.  As a result, the Company has
pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic
acquisitions, where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the
“goodwill” recorded in the transaction.

Office Additions

The Company did not open any offices during 2002.

Internal Growth

Management believes that a comparison of  “same store” growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality
and extent of the Company’s internally generated growth.  This “same store” analysis isolates the
financial contributions from offices that have been included in the Company’s
operating results for at least one full year. 
The table below presents “same store” comparisons on a year-over-year basis
for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s
principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities.  Net cash provided by operating activities
for the year ended December 31, 2002 was approximately $116 million, as
compared with $168 million for 2001. 
This $52 million decrease is principally due increased accounts
receivable, offset by increased net earnings and increased accounts payable,
accrued expenses and taxes payable.

The Company’s
business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. 
Cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality.  Historically, the first quarter shows an
excess of customer collections over customer billings.  This results in positive cash flow.  The increased activity associated with peak
season (typically commencing late second or early third quarter) causes an excess
of customer billings over customer collections.  This cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available
cash.  In the past, the Company has
utilized short-term borrowings to satisfy normal operating expenditures when
temporary cash outflows exceed cash inflows. 
These short-term


borrowings have
been repaid when the trend reverses and customer collections exceed customer
billings.  During 2002, short-term
borrowings were not required in the United States; the market where cash flow
pressures are most intense due to funds advanced in association with customs
brokerage activity.

As a customs
broker, the Company makes significant 5-10 business day cash advances for its
customers’ obligations such as the payment of duties to U.S. Customs.  These advances are made as an accommodation
for a select group of credit-worthy customers. 
Cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component
of revenue and expense.  The billings of
such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts
receivable to the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to
governmental customs authorities.  As a
result of these “pass through” billings, the conventional Days Sales
Outstanding or DSO calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency.

Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002
was $113 million, as compared with $53 million during the same period of
2001.  The largest use of cash in
investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures.  For the year ended December 31, 2002, the
Company made capital expenditures of $81 million as compared with $37 million
for the same period in 2001.  Capital
expenditures in 2002 included $59 million for acquisitions of real estate and
office/warehouse facilities in New Jersey and the United Kingdom.  Capital expenditures in 2001 related
primarily to investments in technology and office furniture and equipment. Cash
of $31.3 million was paid into escrow during 2002 to acquire an office and
warehouse facility near the San Francisco, California International Airport;
the transaction closed on January 7, 2003.

Cash used in
financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $13 million as
compared with cash used in financing activities of $58 million for the same
period in 2001.  In 2002, the Company
paid down $0.4 million on short-term debt, as compared with $3 million for the
same period of 2001.  The Company uses
the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the Company’s stock on
the open market.  The differences
between proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to
repurchase common stock for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2000
represent a timing difference in the receipt of proceeds and the subsequent
repurchase of outstanding shares. 
During the third quarter of 2001, the Board of Directors authorized
management to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.  The difference between proceeds from the
issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock for
the year ended December 31, 2001 is primarily due to the repurchase of stock
under the discretionary plan authorized by the Board of Directors in September
2001.  The repurchase of all 2,000,000
shares was completed on October 11, 2001 at an average price of $22.56 per
share.  In November 2001, the Board of Directors expanded the Company’s
Discretionary Stock Repurchase Program to allow for the repurchase of such
shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to
100,000,000 shares of common stock.  As
of December 31, 2002, no further shares had been repurchased under the amended
discretionary plan.

At December 31,
2002, working capital was $249 million, including cash and short-term
investments of $212 million. The Company had no long-term debt at December 31,
2002.  While the nature of its business
does not require an extensive investment in property and equipment, the Company
cannot eliminate the possibility that it could acquire an equity interest in
property in certain geographic locations. 
Excluding the acquisition of the office and warehouse facility near the
San Francisco, California International Airport, described earlier, the Company
currently expects to spend approximately $35 million for normal capital
expenditures.  In addition to property
and equipment, normal capital expenditures include leasehold improvements,
warehouse equipment, computer hardware and furniture and fixtures.  The Company expects to finance capital
expenditures in 2003, with cash.

The Company borrows internationally and domestically under unsecured
bank lines of credit.  During the third
quarter of 2002, the Company entered into an unsecured line of credit agreement
with a U.S. financial institution.  At
December 31, 2002, the U.S. facility totaled $50 million and the international
bank lines of credit totaled $10.3 million. 
In addition, the Company maintains a bank facility with its U.K. bank
for $8.1 million.  At December 31, 2002,
the Company was directly liable for $1.3 million drawn on these lines of credit
and was contingently liable for an additional $39.1 million from standby
letters of credit and guarantees related to these lines of credit and other
obligations.


At December 31, 2002, the Company’s contractual obligations and other
commitments are as follows:

The Company has a Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to repurchase
shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises.  As of December 31, 2002, the Company had repurchased and retired
5,257,703 shares of common stock at an average price of $12.34 per share over
the period from 1994 through 2002.

The Company also has a Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan under which
it retired 2,000,000 shares of common stock as of October 11, 2001, at an
average price of $22.56 per share.  In
November 2001, this plan was expanded to allow for the repurchase of such
shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to
100,000,000 shares of common stock.  As
of December 31, 2002, no further shares had been repurchased under the amended
discretionary plan.

Management believes that the Company’s current cash position, bank
financing arrangements, and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its
capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.

In some cases, the Company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign
operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls.  At December 31, 2002, cash and cash
equivalent balances of $121.4 million were held by the Company’s non-U.S.
subsidiaries, of which $47.1 million was held in banks in the United
States.  In addition, certain
undistributed earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries accumulated through
December 31, 1992 would, under most circumstances, be subject to some
additional United States income tax if distributed to the Company.  Such undistributed earnings are
approximately $41.9 million and the additional Federal and state taxes payable
in a hypothetical distribution of such accumulated earnings would approximate
$10.1 million.  The Company has not
provided for this additional tax because the Company intends to reinvest such
earnings to fund the expansion of its foreign activities, or to distribute them
in a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be incurred.

Impact of Inflation

To date, the Company’s business has not been adversely affected by
inflation, nor has the Company experienced significant difficulty in passing
carrier rate increases on to its customers by means of price increases.  Direct carrier rate increases could occur over
the short- to medium-term period.  Due
to the high degree of competition in the market place, these rate increases
might lead to an erosion in the Company’s margins.  However, as the Company is not required to purchase or maintain
extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial
interest rate-sensitive indebtedness, the Company currently has limited direct
exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates.


The
forward-looking statements contained in this document involve a number of risks
and uncertainties.  Factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from these statements include, but
are not limited to: risks associated with foreign operations, elimination of
intercompany transactions, matching of expenses with the associated revenue,
seasonality, shifts in consumer demand, the effect that the implementation of
the Euro as the primary currency of 12 member states of the European Union
might have on the global economy and the Company’s international and domestic
customers, other accounting estimates and other risk factors disclosed from
time to time in the Company’s public reports.

ITEM 7A —
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is
exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business.  These risks are primarily related to foreign
exchange risk and changes in short-term interest rates.   The potential impact of the Company’s
exposure to these risks is presented below:

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company conducts business in many different countries and
currencies.  The Company’s business
often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which
differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred.  In the ordinary course of business, the
Company creates numerous intercompany transactions.  This brings a market risk to the Company’s earnings.

Foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by
estimating the impact on the Company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical
changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar, the Company’s functional currency,
relative to the other currencies in which the Company transacts business.  All other things being equal, an average 10%
weakening of the U.S. Dollar, throughout the year ended December 31, 2002,
would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately $12.7
million.  An average 10% strengthening
of the U.S. Dollar, for the same period, would have the effect of reducing
operating income approximately $10.4 million.

The Company has approximately $9 million of intercompany transactions
unsettled at any one point in time.  The
Company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage
foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging
transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations
restrict the Company’s ability to move money freely around the world.  Any such hedging activity throughout the
year ended December 31, 2002, was insignificant.  The Company instead follows a policy of accelerating
international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to
intercompany billings.  The majority of
intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings
arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90 days.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2002, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and
short-term investments of  $211.9
million and short-term borrowings of $1.3 million, all subject to variable
short-term interest rates.  A
hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10% would have an insignificant
impact on the Company’s earnings.

In management’s opinion, there has been no material change in the
Company’s market risk exposure between 2001 and 2002.

Independent Auditors’ Report

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.:

We have audited
the consolidated financial statements of Expeditors International of
Washington, Inc. and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index.  In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement
schedule as listed in the accompanying index. 
These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our
audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America.  Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,
the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Expeditors International of
Washington, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.            Basis of
Presentation

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (“the Company”) is a
global logistics company operating through a worldwide network of offices,
international service centers and exclusive or non-exclusive agents. The
Company’s customers include retailing and wholesaling, electronics, and
manufacturing companies around the world. 
The Company grants credit upon approval to customers.

International trade is influenced by many factors, including economic
and political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange
rates, and United States and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs,
trade restrictions, foreign investments and taxation.  Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to
current tariffs and trade restrictions. 
The Company cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals may be
adopted, nor can the Company predict the effects adoption of any such proposal
will have on the Company’s business. 
Doing business in foreign locations also subjects the Company to a
variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic
enterprises.  In addition to being
affected by governmental policies concerning international trade, the Company’s
business may also be affected by political developments and changes in
government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries.  In
addition, the accounts of exclusive agents have been consolidated in those
circumstances where the Company maintains unilateral control over the agents’
assets and operations, notwithstanding a lack of technical majority ownership
of the agents’ common stock.

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

All dollar amounts in the notes are presented in thousands except for
share data.

B.            Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less
at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

C.            Short-term
Investments

Short-term investments are designated as available-for-sale and
cost approximates market at December 31, 2002 and 2001.

D.            Accounts Receivable

The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is
reviewed at least monthly for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
its customers to make required payments for services.  Additional allowances may be necessary in the future if the
ability of its customers to pay deteriorates.

E.             Long-Lived Assets,
Depreciation and Amortization

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated or
amortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the assets’ estimated
useful lives or lease terms. Useful lives for major categories of property and
equipment are as follows:

Buildings

28 to 40 years

Furniture,
  fixtures, equipment and purchased software

3 to 5 years

Vehicles

3 to 5 years

Expenditures

for maintenance, repairs, and renewals of minor items
are charged to earnings as incurred. 
Major renewals and improvements are capitalized.  Upon disposition, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain
or loss is included in income for the period.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001. Under the new rules, purchased goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to
annual impairment tests in accordance with the provisions of the statements.  The Company applied the new rules on
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of
2002. Application of the
non-amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142 did not

F-6

have a material effect on the Company’s
financial statements. Goodwill amortization expense was $161 during each of the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. 
The Company performed the required initial impairment test of goodwill
as of January 1, 2002 and determined there was no impact on the consolidated
earnings and financial position of the Company at that time.

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company
ceased to amortize goodwill.  Goodwill
is recorded net of accumulated amortization of $765 at December 31, 2002 and
2001.  For the year ended December 31,
2002, the Company performed the required annual impairment test during the
fourth quarter and determined that no impairment had occurred.

In August 2001, SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” was issued which addresses financial accounting
and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. While this
standard supersedes SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,” it retains many of the
fundamental provisions of that standard. SFAS No. 144 also supersedes the
accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the
Results of Operations – Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions,” for the disposal of a segment of a business.

Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their
respective useful lives, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS
No. 144.  The Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 144 beginning in the first quarter of 2002.  Adoption of SFAS No. 144 had no impact on
the consolidated earnings and financial position of the Company.

Other intangible assets consist principally of payments made to
purchase customer lists of former agents in countries where the Company
established its own presence by opening its own offices.  Other intangible assets are included in
Other Assets, net and are amortized over their estimated useful lives for
periods up to 15 years.

Balances as of December 31
are as follows:

Estimated annual amortization expense will approximate $967 during each
of the next five years.

F.             Revenues and
Revenue Recognition

The
Company derives its revenues from three principal sources: airfreight, ocean
freight and customs brokerage and import services and these are the revenue
categories presented in the financial statements.

As
a non-asset based carrier, the Company does not own transportation assets.  Rather, the Company generates the major
portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation
services from direct (asset-based) carriers and reselling those services to its
customers.   The difference between the
rate billed to customers (the sell rate), and the rate paid to the carrier (the
buy rate) is termed “Net Revenue” or “yield”. 
By consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its
buying power, the Company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct
carriers, while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would
otherwise be able to negotiate themselves.

Airfreight
revenues include the charges to the Company for carrying the shipments when the
Company acts as a freight consolidator. 
Ocean freight revenues include the charges to the Company for carrying
the shipments when the Company acts as a Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier
(NVOCC).  In each case the Company is
acting as an indirect carrier.  When
acting as an indirect carrier, the Company will issue a House Airway Bill
(HAWB) or a House Ocean Bill of Lading (HOBL) to customers as the contract of
carriage.  In turn, when the freight is
physically tendered to a direct carrier, the Company receives a contract of
carriage known as a Master Airway Bill for airfreight shipments and a Master
Ocean Bill of Lading for ocean shipments. 
At this point, the risk of loss passes to the carrier, however, in order
to claim for any such loss, the customer is first obligated to pay the freight charges.

Based
upon the terms in the contract of carriage, revenues related to shipments where
the Company issues an HAWB or an HOBL are recognized at the time the freight is
tendered to the direct carrier at origin. 
Costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this same time.

F-7

Revenues
realized in other capacities, for instance, when the Company acts as an agent
for the shipper, and does not issue an HAWB or an HOBL, include only the
commissions and fees earned for the services performed.  These revenues are recognized upon
completion of the services.

Customs
brokerage and import services involves providing services at destination, such
as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required
documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes
on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by
governmental agencies, and arranging for delivery.   This is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of
customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the
Company has offices.  Revenues related
to customs brokerage and import services are recognized upon completion of the
services.

Arranging international shipments is a complex task.  Each actual movement can require multiple
services.  In some instances, the
Company is asked to perform only one of these services.  However, in most instances, the Company may
perform multiple services.  These services
include destination breakbulk services and value added ancillary services such
as local transportation, export customs formalities, distribution services and
logistics management.  Each of these
services has an associated fee, which is recognized as revenue upon completion
of the service.

Typically, the fees for each of these services are quoted as separate
components, however, customers on occasion will request an all-inclusive rate
for a set of services known in the industry as “door-to-door service.”  This means that the customer is billed a
single rate for all services from pickup at origin to delivery at
destination.  In these instances, the
revenue for origin and destination services, as well as revenue that will be
characterized as freight charges, is allocated to branches as set by
preexisting Company policy perhaps supplemented by customer specific
negotiations between the offices involved. 
Each of the Company’s branches are independent profit centers and the
primary compensation for the branch management group comes in the form of
incentive-based compensation calculated directly from the operating income of
that branch.  This compensation
structure ensures that the allocation of revenue and expense among components
of services, when provided under an all-inclusive rate, are done in an
objective manner on a fair value basis, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”

In November 2001, the
FASB staff issued Topic D-103 (subsequently re-characterized as EITF 01-14),
“Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for ‘Out of
Pocket’ Expenses Incurred.”  This staff
announcement clarified certain provisions of EITF 99-19 “Reporting Revenue
Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent,” and among other things
established when reimbursements are required to be shown gross as opposed to
net.  EITF 01-14 also directed that the
new rules should be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2001.  Beginning in the
first quarter of 2002, the Company has complied with the guidance in EITF
01-14.  Prior to the adoption of EITF
01-14, the Company recorded such reimbursements on a net basis.  The Company has reclassified amounts in the
2001 and 2000 presentations to conform with the current presentation.  The amounts reclassified resulted in an
increase to Total Revenues and Transportation Costs of $230,437 in 2001 and
$211,545 in 2000.  There was no impact
on net revenue nor was there any impact on operating income and net earnings as
a result of this change.

G.            Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method of accounting.  Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, the
tax effect of loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled.  The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.

H.            Net
Earnings per Common Share

Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average
number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding.  Dilutive potential common shares represent
outstanding stock options.  Basic
earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average of common shares
outstanding without taking into consideration dilutive potential common shares
outstanding.

I.              Stock Option Plans

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure” which amends SFAS No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide alternative methods
of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation.  SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No.
123 to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial
statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation
and the effect of the method used on reported results.  The transition guidance and annual
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 2002.  The interim

F-8

disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing
financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15,
2002.  As the Company did not make a
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation in 2002, the adoption of SFAS No. 148 did not have an
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of
operations.  The Company has adopted the
annual disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 in its financial reports for the
year ended December 31, 2002 and will adopt the interim disclosure provisions
for its financial reports beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2003.

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option and
its employee stock purchase rights plans. 
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its fixed
stock option or employee stock purchase rights plans.  Had compensation cost for the Company’s three stock based
compensation and employee stock purchase rights plans been determined
consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net earnings, basic earnings per
share and diluted earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma
amounts indicated below:

See Note 5C. for information on the assumptions used to estimate the
fair value of option grants.

J.             Foreign Currency

Foreign currency amounts attributable to foreign operations have been
translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates for assets and
liabilities, historical rates for equity, and average annual rates for revenues
and expenses.  Unrealized gains or
losses arising from fluctuations in the year-end exchange rates are generally
recorded as components of other comprehensive income as adjustments from
foreign currency translation.  Currency
fluctuations are a normal operating factor in the conduct of the Company’s
business and exchange transaction gains and losses are generally included in
freight consolidation expenses.

The Company follows a policy of accelerating international currency
settlements to manage its foreign exchange exposure.  Accordingly, the Company enters into foreign currency hedging
transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial
limitations on the Company’s ability to move money freely around the
world.  Such hedging activity during
2002, 2001 and 2000 was insignificant. 
Net foreign currency gains realized during 2002 were $70.  Net foreign currency losses realized during
2001 were $366.  Net foreign currency
gains realized during 2000 were $309.

K.            Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses
affecting shareholders’ equity that, under generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States, are excluded from net income.  For the Company, these consist of foreign
currency translation gains and losses, net of related income tax effects.

L.             Segment Reporting

The Company is organized functionally in geographic operating
segments.  Accordingly, management
focuses its attention on revenues, net revenues, operating income, identifiable
assets, capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization and equity
generated in

each of these
geographical areas when evaluating effectiveness of geographic management.  The Company charges its subsidiaries and
affiliates for services rendered in the United States on a cost recovery basis.  Transactions among the Company’s various
offices are conducted using the same arms-length pricing methodologies the
Company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents.

F-9

M.           Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
period.  Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

N.            Reclassification

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the
2002 presentation.

O.            New Accounting
Pronouncements

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
for the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result
from the acquisition, construction or development and/or normal use of the
asset. The Company is required and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS No.
143 beginning in the first quarter of 2003. 
Management does not anticipate that adoption of SFAS No. 143 will result
in a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or
results of operations.

In June 2002, SFAS No.
146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” was
issued which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated
with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF 94-3, “Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit
an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).”  The Company is required and plans to adopt
the provisions of SFAS No. 146 beginning in the first quarter of 2003.  Management does not anticipate that adoption
of SFAS No. 146 will result in a significant impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45),
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” which clarifies disclosure and
recognition/measurement requirements related to certain guarantees. The
disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after
December 15, 2002 and the recognition/measurement requirements are effective on
a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.  The provisions of FIN 45 require the Company
to value and record the liability for any indirect or direct guarantees of the
indebtedness of others entered into after December 31, 2002.  The Company does not expect compliance with
FIN 45 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

NOTE 2.  OTHER ASSETS

Other assets at December 31, 2002 included $31,250 paid into escrow in
anticipation of purchasing an office and warehouse facility near the San
Francisco, California International Airport. 
This transaction closed on January 7, 2003.

During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company evaluated the
recoverability of certain other assets and determined that an impairment had
occurred.  Accordingly, a $3,502 loss
was recorded as an operating expense.

F-10

NOTE 3.  CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

The Company has a $50,000 United States bank line of credit extending
through July 1, 2003.  Borrowings under
the line bear interest at LIBOR + .75% (2.25% at December 31, 2002) and are
unsecured.  As of December 31, 2002, the
Company had no borrowings under this line.

The majority of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries maintain bank lines
of credit for short-term working capital purposes.  These credit lines are supported by standby letters of credit
issued by a United States bank, or guarantees issued by the Company to the
foreign banks issuing the credit line. 
Lines of credit totaling $10,284 and $9,396 at December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively, bear interest at rates up to 3% over the foreign banks’
equivalent prime rates.  At December 31,
2002 and 2001, the Company was liable for $1,319 and $1,706, respectively, of
borrowings under these lines, and at December 31, 2002 was contingently liable
for approximately $39,138 under outstanding standby letters of credit and
guarantees related to these lines of credit and other obligations.

In addition, at December 31, 2002 the Company had an $8,052 credit
facility with a United Kingdom bank (U.K. facility), secured by a corporate
guarantee.  The Company was contingently
liable under the U.K. facility at December 31, 2002 for $8,052 used to secure
customs bonds issued to foreign governments.

At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive
covenants of these credit lines and the associated credit facilities, including
maintenance of certain minimum asset, working capital and equity balances and
ratios.

NOTE 4.  INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000 includes the following
components:

Income tax expense differs from amounts computed by applying the U.S.
Federal income tax rate of 35% to earnings before income taxes as a result of
the following:

F-11

The components of earnings before income taxes are as follows:

The tax effects of

temporary

differences, tax credits and operating loss
carryforwards that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and
deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows:

The Company has not provided U.S. Federal income taxes on undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries accumulated through December 31, 1992 since
the Company intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely or to distribute
them in a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be
incurred.  Such undistributed earnings
are approximately $41,900 and the additional Federal and state taxes payable in
a hypothetical distribution of such accumulated earnings would approximate
$10,100.  Since 1993, the Company has
been providing for Federal and state income tax expense on foreign earnings
without regard to whether such earnings will be permanently reinvested outside
the United States.

NOTE 5.  SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

A.            Dividends

On May 8, 2002, the Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split,
effected in the form of a stock dividend of one share of common stock for every
share outstanding, and increased the authorized common stock to 320,000,000
shares.  The stock dividend was
distributed on June 24, 2002 to shareholders of record on June 10, 2002. All
share and per share information, except par value per share, has been adjusted
for all years to reflect the stock split.

B.            Stock Repurchase
Plans

The Company has a Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan under which
management is authorized to repurchase up to 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s
common stock in the open market with the proceeds received from the exercise of
Employee and Director Stock Options.  As
of December 31, 2002, the Company had repurchased and retired 5,257,703 shares
of common stock at an average price of $12.34 per share over the period from
1994 through 2002.

In September 2001,
the Board of Directors approved a Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to
repurchase and retire 2,000,000 shares of common stock.  As of October 11, 2001, all 2,000,000 shares
had been repurchased and retired under the plan at an average price of $22.56
per share.  In November 2001, the Board
of Directors expanded the Company’s Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to
allow

F-12

for the repurchase
of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock
to 100,000,000 shares of common stock. 
As of December 31, 2002, no further shares had been repurchased under
the amended discretionary plan.

C.            Stock Option Plans

The Company has two stock option plans (the “1985 Plan” and the “1997
Plan”) for employees under which the Board of Directors may grant officers and
key employees options to purchase common stock at prices equal to or greater
than market value on the date of grant. 
The 1985 Plan provides for non-qualified grants at exercise prices equal
to or greater than the market value on the date of grant. Outstanding options
generally vest and become exercisable over periods up to five years from the
date of grant and expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant. The 1997
Plan provides for qualified and non-qualified grants of options to purchase
shares, limited to not more than 200,000 per person per year.  Grants less than or equal to 40,000 shares
in any fiscal year, are granted at or above common stock prices on the date of
grant.  Any 1997 Plan grants in excess
of the initial 40,000 shares granted per person per year (“Excess Grants”)
require an exercise price of not less than 120% of the common stock price on
the date of grant.  Excess Grants under
the 1997 Plan

vest completely in 3
years,  and expire no later than 5
years, from the date of grant.

The Company also has a stock option plan (“Directors’ Plan”) under
which non-employee directors elected at each annual meeting are granted non-qualified
options to purchase 16,000 shares of common stock on the first business day of
the month following the meeting.

Upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options, the Company derives a
tax deduction measured by the excess of the market value over the option price
at the date of exercise.  The related
tax benefit is credited to additional paid-in capital.

Details regarding the plans are as follows:

F-13

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
assumptions used for grants:

The following table summarizes information about fixed-price
stock options outstanding at December 31, 2002:

The number of stock options exercisable at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
were respectively, 3,983,924, at a weighted average exercise price of $5.78 per
share, and 5,194,000, at a weighted average exercise price of $3.39 per share.

D.            Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share

The following table reconciles the numerator and the denominator of the
basic and diluted per share computations for earnings per share in 2002, 2001
and 2000.

For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, options to
purchase 76,600 shares, 66,400 shares and 5,900 shares, respectively, of common
stock with exercise prices greater than the average fair market value of our
stock for the period of $29.58, $26.76 and $22.51, respectively, were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect
would have been antidilutive.

F-14

E.             Stock Purchase Plan

In May 2002, the shareholders approved the Company’s 2002 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (“2002 Plan”), which became effective August 1, 2002 upon
the expiration of the 1988 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“1988 Plan”) on July
31, 2002.  The Company’s 2002 Plan
provides for 2,152,726 shares of the Company’s common stock, including 152,726
remaining shares transferred from the 1988 Plan, to be reserved for issuance
upon exercise of purchase rights granted to employees who elect to participate
through regular payroll deductions beginning August 1 of each year.  The purchase rights are exercisable on July
31 of the following year at a price equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair
market value of the Company’s stock on July 31 or (2) 85% of the fair market
value of the Company’s stock on the preceding August 1.  At December 31, 2002, $5,262 had been
withheld in connection with the 2002 Plan year ending July 31, 2003.

NOTE 6.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company’s financial instruments, other than cash, consist primarily
of cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, short-term
debt, accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
The fair values of these financial instruments approximate their
carrying amounts based upon market interest rates or their short-term nature.

NOTE 7.  COMMITMENTS

A.            Leases

The Company occupies office and warehouse facilities under terms of
operating leases expiring up to 2010. 
Total rent expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $28,147, $24,323 and
$19,390, respectively.  At December 31, 2002,
future minimum annual lease payments under all leases are as follows:

B.            Employee Benefits

The Company has employee savings plans under which the Company provides
