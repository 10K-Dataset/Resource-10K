PART I

ITEM 1—BUSINESS

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. is engaged in the business

of providing global logistics services. 

The Company offers its customers a seamless international network

supporting the movement and strategic positioning of goods.  The Company’s services include the consolidation

or forwarding of air and ocean freight. 

In each U.S. office, and in many overseas offices, the Company acts as a

customs broker.  The Company also

provides additional services including distribution management, vendor

consolidation, cargo insurance, purchase order management and customized

logistics information.  The Company does

not compete for domestic freight, overnight courier or small parcel business

and does not own aircraft or steamships.

The Company, including its majority owned subsidiaries,

operates full service offices (•) in the cities identified below.  Full service offices have also been

established in locations where the Company maintains unilateral control over

assets and operations and where the existence of the parent-subsidiary

relationship is maintained by means other than record ownership of voting stock

(#).   In other cities, the Company

contracts with independent agents to provide required services and has

established over 120 such relationships world-wide.  Locations where Company employees perform sales and customer

service functions are identified below as international service centers

(*).  In each case, the opening date for

the full service office or international service center is set forth in

parenthesis.



The Company was

incorporated in the State of Washington in May 1979.  Its executive offices are located at 1015 Third Avenue, 12

th

Floor, Seattle, Washington, and its telephone number is (206) 674-3400.

For information

concerning the amount of revenues, net revenues, operating income, identifiable

assets, capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization attributable to

the geographic areas in which the Company conducts its business, see Note 8 to

the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Beginning in 1981, the

Company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from the Far East

to the United States and related customs brokerage and import services.  In the mid-1980’s, the Company began to

expand its service capabilities in export airfreight, ocean freight and

distribution services.  Today the Company

offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of

customers, both in terms of industry specialization and geographic

location.  As opportunities for

profitable growth arise, the Company plans to create new offices.  While the Company has historically expanded

through organic growth, the Company has also been open to growth through

acquisition of, or establishing joint ventures with, existing agents or others

within the industry.

Airfreight

Services

Airfreight services

accounted for approximately 42, 41, and 41 percent of the Company’s 2001, 2000,

and 1999 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses (“net

revenues”), respectively.  When

performing airfreight services, the Company typically acts either as a freight

consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment.  When acting as a freight consolidator, the

Company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that

space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly

from airlines.  When moving shipments

between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation,

the Company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the

airline which carries the shipment. Whether acting as an agent or consolidator,

the Company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing, familiarity with

local business practices, knowledge of export and import documentation and

procedures, the ability to arrange for ancillary services, and assistance with

space availability in periods of peak demand.

In its airfreight

forwarding operations, the Company procures shipments from its customers,

determines the routing, consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport

distribution point, and selects the airline for transportation to the

distribution point.  At the distribution

point, the Company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken

down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual

shipments to their final destinations.

The Company estimates its

average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3,500 to 4,500 pounds and

includes merchandise from several shippers. 

Because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean

transportation, air shipments are generally characterized by a high

value-to-weight ratio, the need for rapid delivery, or both.

The Company typically

delivers shipments from a Company warehouse at the origin to the airline after

consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets.  Shipments normally arrive at the destination

distribution point within forty-eight hours after such delivery.  During peak shipment periods, cargo space

available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of

freight shipments may occur.  When these

conditions exist, the Company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand.

The Company consolidates

individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in

cost-effective combinations. Typically, as the weight or volume of a shipment

increases, the cost per pound/kilo or cubic inch/centimeter charged by the

Company decreases.  The rates charged by

airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or

volume of the shipment increases.  As a

result, by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single

shipment, the Company is able to obtain a lower rate per pound/kilo or cubic

inch/centimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual

shipment, while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be

obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment.

The Company’s net

airfreight forwarding revenues from a consolidated shipment includes the

differential between the rate charged to the Company by an airline and the rate

which the Company charges to its customers, commissions paid to the Company by

the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services.  Such ancillary services provided by the

Company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation, packing,

crating and insurance services, negotiation of letters of credit, and

preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws.  When the Company acts as an agent for an

airline handling an unconsolidated shipment, its net revenues are primarily

derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services

paid by the customer.


The Company does not own

aircraft and does not plan to do so. 

Management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the

Company to undue business risks, including large capital outlays, increased

fixed operating expenses, problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition

with airlines.  Because the Company

relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments, changes in carrier policies

and practices such as pricing, payment terms, scheduling, and frequency of

service may affect its business.

The Company also performs

breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated

airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual

shipments.  Breakbulk service revenues

also include commissions from non-exclusive agents for airfreight shipments.

Customs Brokerage and

Import Services

Customs brokerage and

import services accounted for approximately 35, 38, and 39 percent of the

Company’s 2001, 2000, and 1999 consolidated net revenues, respectively.  As a customs broker, the Company assists

importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation,

calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer,

arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies, and arranging

for delivery.  The Company also provides

other services at destination including temporary warehousing, inland

transportation, inventory manipulation and management, cargo insurance and

product distribution.

The Company provides

customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles

as a freight forwarder.  However,

substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to

use a competing forwarder.   Conversely,

shipments handled by the Company as a forwarder may be processed by another

customs broker selected by the customer.

The Company also provides

custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the United States,

Canada and/or Mexico.  The commodities

being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business

required the Company to make significant modifications to its systems and

traditional office structure in order to provide competitive service.

During 1996 the Company

established a subsidiary, Expeditors Tradewin, L.L.C., to respond to customer

driven requests for high-end customs consulting services.  The demand for these services was stimulated

by the changes made by the U.S. Customs Service in response to the 1993 Customs

Modernization Act.  Fees for these

non-transactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for

mutually agreed procedures.

There is currently a

noticeable trend, prompted by customer demand, to quote rates on a door-to-door

basis.  Management foresees the

potential, in the medium- to long-term, for fees normally associated with

customs clearance to be de-emphasized and included as a component of other

services offered by the Company.

Ocean Freight and Ocean

Services

Ocean freight services

accounted for approximately 23, 21, and 20 percent of the Company’s 2001, 2000,

and 1999 consolidated net revenues, respectively.  The Company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are derived

from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to

customers for ancillary services which the Company may provide, such as

preparing documentation, procuring insurance, arranging for packing and crating

services, and providing consultation. 

The Company operates Expeditors International Ocean (“EIO”), a

Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (“NVOCC”) specializing in ocean freight

consolidation from the Far East to the United States.   EIO also provides service, on a smaller scale, to and from any

location where the Company has an office or agent.  As an NVOCC, EIO contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain

transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a

specified time period at an agreed rate. 

EIO solicits less than container load (“LCL”) freight to fill the

containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping

lines.  EIO also handles full container

loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to

negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers.  The Company does not own vessels and

generally does not physically handle the cargo.

Expeditors Cargo Management Systems (“ECMS”) supplies

a sophisticated ocean consolidation service. 

The Company owns and maintains software that allows it to sell ECMS to

large volume customers that have signed their own service contracts with the

ocean carriers.  As an ocean

consolidator, ECMS may obtain LCL freight from several vendors and consolidate

this cargo into full containers.  The

Company’s revenues as an ocean consolidator are derived from handling LCL cargo

at origin and from the fees paid by customers for access to data captured

during the consolidation process.


Marketing and Customers

The Company provides

flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points

of origin to ultimate destinations. 

Although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company

and the services that will be required, the foreign shipper may also

participate in this selection process. 

Therefore, the Company coordinates its marketing program to reach both

domestic importers and their overseas suppliers.

The Company’s marketing

efforts are focused primarily on the traffic, shipping and purchasing

departments of existing and potential customers.  The district manager of each office is responsible for marketing,

sales coordination, and implementation in the area in which he or she is

located.  All employees are responsible

for customer service and relations.

The Company staffs its

offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the

nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global

logistics.  Marketing and customer

service staffs are responsible for marketing the Company’s services directly to

local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection

of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and

efficient service.  The Company believes

that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its

customers, its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer

service and marketing activities, and the incentives it gives to its managers

have been important elements of its success.

The goods handled by the

Company are generally a function of the products which dominate international

trade between any particular origin and destination.  Shipments of computer components, other electronic equipment,

housewares, sporting goods, machine parts, and toys, comprise a significant

percentage of the Company’s business. 

Typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of

consumer electronics, department store chains, clothing and shoe wholesalers,

manufacturers and catalogue stores. 

Historically, no single customer has accounted for five percent or more

of the Company’s revenues.

Competition

The global logistics

services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the

foreseeable future.  There are a large

number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry, but the

number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics

services is more limited.  Depending on

the location of the shipper and the importer, the Company must compete against

both the niche players and larger entities. 

While there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward

consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational and

multi-service networks, the regional and local competitors maintain a strong

market presence.

Historically, the primary competitive factors in the

global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service, including

reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of

operations.  The Company emphasizes

quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of

others in the industry.  Recently,

larger customers have exhibited a trend toward more sophisticated and efficient

procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing

strategies such as just-in-time inventory management.  This trend has made computerized customer service capabilities a

significant factor in attracting and retaining customers.  These computerized customer service

capabilities include customized Electronic Data Interchange, (“EDI”), and

on-line freight tracing and tracking applications.  The customized EDI applications allow the transfer of key

information between the customers’ systems and the Company’s systems.  Freight tracing and tracking applications

allow customers to know the location, transit time and estimated delivery time

of inventory in transit.

Management believes that

the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’

increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the

ongoing success of the Company. 

Accordingly, the Company has devoted a significant amount of resources towards

the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer

demands.  Management believes that the

Company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by

other logistics services companies with which it competes.

Developing these systems

has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to

customers.  Small and middle-tier

competitors, in general, do not have the resources available to develop these

customized systems.  As a result, there

is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the

industry.  Management expects that this

trend toward consolidation will continue for the short- to medium-term.  Historically, growth through aggressive

acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the Company’s competitors

and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill”.  As a result, the Company has pursued a

strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions.


The Company’s ability to attract, retain, and motivate

highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an

essential, if not the most important, element of its ability to compete in the

industry.  To this end, the Company has

adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch

revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key

personnel.  The Company believes that

these incentive compensation programs, combined with its experienced personnel

and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts, provide it with a

distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that

competitors have matched only through acquisition.

Currency and Other Risk

Factors

The nature of the

Company’s worldwide operations necessitate the Company dealing with a multitude

of currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. 

This results in the Company being exposed to the inherent risks of the

international currency markets and governmental interference.  Many of the countries where the Company

maintains offices and/or agency relationships have strict  currency 

control  regulations  which 

influence  the  Company’s 

ability  to  hedge 

foreign  currency  exposure. 

The Company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating

international currency settlements among these offices or agents.

In addition, the

Company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on

good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines,

steamship lines and governmental agencies. 

The Company considers its current working relationships with these

entities to be good.  However, changes

in space allotments available from carriers, governmental deregulation efforts,

“modernization” of the regulations governing customs clearance, and/or changes

in governmental quota restrictions could affect the Company’s business in

unpredictable ways.

Seasonality

Historically, the

Company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured

on a quarterly basis.  The first quarter

has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have

traditionally been the strongest.  This

pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors including

climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and a myriad

of other similar and subtle forces.  In

addition, this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and

diversification of the Company’s international network and service

offerings.  The Company cannot

accurately forecast many of these factors, nor can the Company estimate

accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and, as a result,

there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future

periods.

A significant portion of

the Company’s revenues are derived from customers in industries whose shipping

patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries

whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just-in-time production

schedules.  Therefore, the timing of the

Company’s revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of the

Company’s control, such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and

manufacturing production delays. 

Additionally, many customers ship a significant portion of their goods

at or near the end of a quarter, and therefore, the Company may not learn of a

shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter. 

To the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected

by securities analysts, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities

analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the

Company’s stock.

Environmental

In the United States, the

Company is subject to Federal, state and local provisions regulating the

discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of

the environment.  Similar laws apply in

many foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  Although current operations have not been

significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws, governments

are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues, and the Company

cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its

business.  The Company does not anticipate

making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes

during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years.


Employees

At February 28,

2002, the Company employed approximately 7,590 people, 2,776 in the United

States and 458 in the balance of North America, 255 in South America, 1,296 in

Europe, 1,949 in the Far East & Australasia, 702 in the Near/Middle East

and 154 in Africa.  Approximately 944 of

the Company’s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and

customer service, 4,748 in operations and 1,898 in finance and

administration.  The Company is not a

party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with

its employees to be satisfactory.

In order to retain

the services of highly qualified, experienced, and motivated employees, the

Company places considerable emphasis on its incentive compensation programs and

stock option plans.

Regulation

With respect to

the Company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the United

States, it is subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation (“DOT”)

as an indirect air carrier.  The

Company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in

their respective countries of operation. 

The Company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its

newer offices, has made application for a license, as an airfreight forwarder

by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”). IATA is a voluntary

association of airlines which prescribes certain operating procedures for

airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members.  The majority of the Company’s airfreight

forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are IATA members.

The Company is

licensed as a customs broker by the Customs Service of the Department of the

Treasury in each U.S. customs district in which it does business.  All U.S. customs brokers are required to

maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by the Customs

Service.  In other jurisdictions in

which the Company performs clearance services, the Company is licensed by the

appropriate governmental authority.

The Company is

registered as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary by the Federal Maritime

Commission (“FMC”).  The FMC has

established certain qualifications for shipping agents, including certain

surety bonding requirements.  The


FMC also is responsible

for the economic regulation of NVOCC activity originating or terminating in the

United States.  To comply with these

economic regulations, vessel operators and NVOCCs, such as EIO, are required to

file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the

movement of specified commodities into and out of the U.S.  The FMC has the power to enforce these

regulations by assessing penalties.

The Company does

not believe that current U.S. and foreign governmental regulations impose

significant economic restraint upon its business operations.  In general, the Company conducts its

business activities in each country through a majority-owned subsidiary

corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country.  However, the regulations of foreign

governments can impose barriers to the Company’s ability to provide the full

range of its business activities in a wholly or majority U.S.-owned

subsidiary.  For example, foreign

ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions

and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight

forwarding and/or freight consolidation is restricted to local entities.  When the Company encounters this sort of

governmental restriction, it works to establish a legal structure that meets

the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the Company the

substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the

absence of such regulation. This can be accomplished by creating a joint

venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that

holds the required license.  In cases

where the Company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the

local entity, notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of

common stock, the Company consolidates the accounts of the local entity.  In such cases, consolidation is necessary to

fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the Company

because of the existence of the parent-subsidiary relationship by means other

than record ownership of voting common stock.

Cargo Liability

When acting as an

airfreight consolidator, the Company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or

damaged shipments. This legal liability is typically limited by contract to the

lower of the transaction value or the released value ($9.07 per pound unless

the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge), except if the loss

or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate

airway bill.  The airline which the

Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the Company

in the same manner and to the same extent. 

When acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper, the Company

does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments

tendered to the airline.

When acting as an ocean

freight consolidator, the Company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or

damaged shipments.  This liability is

typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released  value 

($500 per package  or

customary  freight  unit 

unless the  customer  declares a 

higher value and pays a surcharge). 

The steamship line which the Company utilizes to make the actual

shipment is generally liable to the Company in the same manner and to the same

extent.  In its ocean freight forwarding

and customs clearance operations, the Company does not assume cargo liability.

When providing warehouse

and distribution services, the Company limits its legal liability by contract

and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or fifty

cents per pound with a maximum of fifty dollars per “lot” — which is defined as

the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track.  Upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse

and distribution services, the Company will assume additional liability.

The Company maintains

marine cargo insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or

damaged shipments for which it is legally liable.  The Company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of

others which is stored in Company warehouse facilities.

ITEM 2 — PROPERTIES

The Company owns a

214,000 square foot office building in downtown Seattle, a 150,000 square foot

warehouse/industrial office facility in Nassau County, New York, a 27,200

square foot office facility near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, an

80,000 square foot office and warehouse facility on a ten-acre parcel near

O’Hare International Airport in Chicago, a 5,500 square foot office facility in

the Tsim Sha Tsui East district of Kowloon, Hong Kong, and a 10,900 square foot

office facility in Taipei, Taiwan.  The

Company also owns a 23,400 square foot office and warehouse facility on a

long-term renewable land lease at the Brussels Cargo facility in Brussels,

Belgium, and recently completed an 85,000 square foot office and warehouse

facility in Dublin, Ireland.

The Company leases and

maintains 60 additional offices and satellite locations in the United States

and 124 offices throughout the world, each located close to an airport, ocean

port, or on an important border crossing. 

The majority of


these facilities contain warehouse facilities.  Lease terms are either on a month-to-month

basis or terminate at various times through 2009.  As an office matures, the Company will investigate the

possibility of building or buying suitable facilities.  Lease payments currently aggregate to

approximately $2,354,000 per month.  See

Note 6 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company believes that current leases can

be extended and that suitable alternative facilities are available in the

vicinity of each present facility should extensions be unavailable at the

conclusion of current leases.

ITEM 3 — LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is ordinarily

involved in claims and lawsuits which arise in the normal course of business,

none of which currently, in management’s opinion, will have a significant

effect on the Company’s financial position.

SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS UNDER SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995;

CERTAIN CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

From time to time, the

Company or its representatives have made or may make forward-looking

statements, orally or in writing.  Such

forward-looking statements may be included in, but not limited to, press

releases, oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive

officer or in various filings made by the Company with the Securities and

Exchange Commission. The words or phrases “will likely result”, “are expected

to”, “will continue”, “is anticipated”, “estimate”, “project” or similar

expressions are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the

meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act.  Such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to

and are accompanied by the following discussion of certain important factors

that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking

statements.

The risks included here

are not exhaustive.  Furthermore,

reference is also made to other sections of this report which include

additional factors which could adversely impact the Company’s business and

financial performance.  Moreover, the

Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment.  New risk factors emerge from time to time

and it is not possible for management to predict all of such risk factors, nor

can it assess the impact of all of such risk factors on the Company’s business

or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual

results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking

statements.  Accordingly,

forward-looking statements cannot be relied upon as a guarantee of actual

results.

Shareholders should be

aware that while the Company does, from time to time, communicate with

securities analysts, it is against the Company’s policy to disclose to such

analysts any material non-public information or other confidential commercial

information.  Accordingly, shareholders

should not assume that the Company agrees with any statement or report issued

by any analyst irrespective of the content of such statement or report.

Furthermore, the Company has a policy against issuing financial forecasts or

projections or confirming the accuracy of forecasts or projections issued by

others.  Accordingly, to the extent that

reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or

opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of the Company.



ITEM 7 — MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. is engaged in the business

of global logistics management, including international freight forwarding and

consolidation, for both air and ocean freight. 

The Company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices, and in many

of its international offices.  The Company

also provides additional services for its customers including value added

distribution, purchase order management, vendor consolidation and other

logistics solutions.  The Company offers

domestic forwarding services only in conjunction with international

shipments.  The Company does not compete

for overnight courier or small parcel business.  The Company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships.

International trade is influenced by many factors, including economic

and political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange

rates, and United States and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs,

trade restrictions, foreign investments and taxation.  Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to

current tariffs and trade restrictions. 

The Company cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals may be

adopted, nor can the Company predict the effects adoption of any such proposal

will have on the Company’s business. 

Doing business in foreign locations also subjects the Company to a

variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic

enterprises.  In addition to being

affected by governmental policies concerning international trade, the Company’s

business may also be affected by political developments and changes in

government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business.

The Company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly

dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including

airlines, ocean steamship lines, and governmental agencies.  The Company considers its current working

relationships with these entities to be satisfactory.  However, changes in space allotments available from carriers,

governmental deregulation efforts, “modernization” of the regulations governing

customs brokerage, and/or changes in governmental quota restrictions could

affect the Company’s business in unpredictable ways.

Historically, the Company’s operating results have been subject to a

seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis.  The first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the

third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest.  This pattern is the result of, or is

influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays, consumer

demand, economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle

forces.  In addition, this historical

quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the

Company’s international network and service offerings.  The Company cannot accurately forecast many

of these factors nor can the Company estimate accurately the relative influence

of any particular factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance that

historical patterns, if any, will continue in future periods.

A significant portion of the Company’s revenues are derived from

customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to

consumer demand, and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are

dependent upon just-in-time production schedules.  Therefore, the timing of the Company’s revenues are, to a large

degree, impacted by factors out of the Company’s control, such as a sudden

change in consumer demand for retail goods and/or manufacturing production

delays.  Additionally, many customers

ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and

therefore, the Company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a

quarter.  To the extent that a shortfall

in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts, any such

shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate

and adverse effect on the trading price of the Company’s stock.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management believes

that the nature of the Company’s business

is

such that there are

few, if any, complex challenges in accounting for operations.  While judgments and estimates are a

necessary component of any system of accounting, the Company’s use of estimates

is limited primarily to the areas of accounts receivable valuation, the useful

lives of long-term assets and the accrual of costs related to ancillary

services the Company provides—areas that in the aggregate are not a major

component of the Company’s statement of earnings.  Management believes that the methods utilized in all of these

areas are non-aggressive in approach and consistent in application.  Management believes that there are limited,

if any, alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to

the Company’s transactions.  While the

use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those

contemplated by the estimates, the Company


believes that

alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not

produce materially different results than those reported.

Results of Operations

The following table shows the consolidated net revenues (revenues less

transportation expenses) attributable to the Company’s principal services and

the Company’s expenses for 2001, 2000 and 1999, expressed as percentages of net

revenues.  With respect to the Company’s

services other than freight consolidation, net revenues are identical to

revenues. Management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total

revenues of the relative importance of the Company’s principal services since

total revenues earned by the Company as a freight consolidator include the

carriers’ charges to the Company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues

earned by the Company in its other capacities include only the commissions and

fees actually earned by the Company.

2001 compared with 2000

Airfreight net revenues in 2001 increased 13% compared with 2000

primarily due to the Company’s ability to expand airfreight margins despite the

lower airfreight tonnages, experienced in 2001 compared with 2000.  Airfreight margins expanded approximately 5%

during 2001 as compared with 2000 despite a 9% drop in worldwide airfreight

tonnage in 2001.  Efficient

consolidations of dense and fluffy (volumetric) freight allowed the Company to

optimize purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates

to customers.  The Company’s North

American export airfreight net revenues increased 4% in 2001 compared to

2000.  Airfreight net revenues from the

Far East and from Europe increased 24% and 5%, respectively, for 2001 compared

with 2000.  Airfreight rates on Far East

to North American trade lanes, the Company’s most dominant lane, remained

strong throughout 2001.

Ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 21% in 2001

compared to 2000.  Ocean freight demand

remained strong throughout 2001 and ocean freight rates from the Far East, the

Company’s largest trade lane, increased in the last half of the year.  During 2001, management continued to expand

market share, increase ocean tonnage, and increase net ocean freight revenues

while offering competitive market rates to customers.  Changes in the regulatory environment in the United States

created new opportunities for the Company’s NVOCC operations to provide

services to customers who had


previously dealt directly with the ocean carriers.  Margins increased 3% in 2001 as compared with 2000 reflecting the

Company’s ability to offer competitive rates to customers at the retail level,

while leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the

wholesale level.  Expeditors Cargo

Management Systems (ECMS), a PC-based ocean freight consolidation management

and purchase order tracking service, continued to be instrumental in attracting

new business.  The Company’s North

American export ocean freight net revenues increased 10% in 2001 compared to

2000.  This increase was a result of the

Company handling more ocean shipments moving from North America to the Far East

and, to a lesser extent, from North America to Europe.  Ocean freight net revenues from the Far East

and from Europe increased 23% and 30%, respectively, for 2001 compared with

2000.

Customs brokerage and import services revenues increased 3% in 2001 as

compared with 2000 as a result of (1) the Company’s growing reputation for

providing high quality service, (2) consolidation within the customs brokerage

market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated

computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program,

and (3) the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and

distinct service offered to existing and potential customers.  Distribution services accounted for nearly

36% of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for 2001

compared with 2000.

Salaries and related costs increased in 2001 compared to 2000 as a

result of (1) the Company’s increased hiring of sales, operations, and

administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases

in business activity and (2) increased compensation levels.  Salaries and related costs increased 1% as a

percentage of net revenues.  The

relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the

result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the

inception of the Company: offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to

share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the

business unit controlled by each key employee. 

Using this compensation model, changes in individual compensation will

occur in proportion to changes in Company profits.  Management believes that the growth in revenues, net revenues and

net earnings for 2001 are a result of the incentives inherent in the Company’s

compensation program.

Other operating expenses increased in 2001 as compared with 2000 as

rent expense, communications expense, quality and training expenses, and other

costs expanded to accommodate the Company’s growing operations.  Other operating expenses as a percentage of

net revenues decreased 2% in 2001 as compared with 2000.  Management believes that this decrease was

significant as it reflects the successful achievement of cost containment

objectives initiated at the branch level. 

The ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent

upon branch level management’s ability to adhere to these objectives

.

Other income, net, increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 primarily due

to interest income earned on higher cash balances and short-term investments in

2001.  Management attributes higher cash

balances, in large part, to the success of cash management and billing

improvement initiatives.

The Company pays income taxes in the United States and other

jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of

operations.  The Company’s consolidated

effective income tax rate in 2001 was 37%, down marginally from the 37.7% rate

experienced in the

prior

year.  The .7%

decrease was caused primarily

by a reduction in state tax expense required to be paid by

the Company.

2000 compared with 1999

Airfreight net revenues in 2000 increased 23% compared with 1999

primarily due to (1) increased airfreight shipments and tonnages handled by the

Company from the Far East to North America and Europe, (2) increased prices

charged by the airlines which were passed along to customers, and (3) increased

export airfreight shipments and tonnages from North America and Europe.  Airfreight margins expanded approximately 2%

during 2000 as compared with 1999. 

Higher freight volumes and efficient consolidations of dense and fluffy

(volumetric) freight allowed the Company to optimize purchased transportation

costs while still offering competitive rates to customers.  The Company’s North American export

airfreight net revenues increased 21% in 2000 compared to 1999.  Airfreight net revenues from the Far East

and from Europe increased 31% and 9%, respectively, for 2000 compared with

1999.  Airfreight rates on Far East to

North American trade lanes, the Company’s most dominant lane, remained strong

throughout 2000.

Ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 32% in 2000

compared to 1999.  Ocean freight demand

remained strong throughout 2000 and ocean freight rates from the Far East, the

Company’s largest trade lane, increased in the last half of the year.  During 2000, management continued to expand

market share, increase ocean tonnage, and increase net ocean freight revenues

while offering competitive market rates to customers.  Changes in the regulatory environment in the United States

created new opportunities for the Company’s NVOCC operations to provide

services to customers who had


previously dealt directly with the ocean carriers.  Margins remained nearly constant in 2000 as

compared with 1999.  ECMS continued to

be instrumental in attracting new business. 

The Company’s North American export ocean freight net revenues increased

26% in 2000 compared to 1999.  This

increase was a result of the Company handling more ocean shipments moving from

North America to the Far East and, to a lesser extent, from North America to

Europe.  Ocean freight net revenues from

the Far East and from Europe increased 38% and 26%, respectively, for 2000

compared with 1999.

Customs brokerage and import services revenues increased 21% in 2000 as

compared with 1999 as a result of (1) the Company’s growing reputation for

providing high quality service, (2) consolidation within the customs brokerage

market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated

computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program,

and (3) the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and

distinct service offered to existing and potential customers.  Distribution services accounted for nearly

22% of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for 2000

compared with 1999.

Salaries and related costs increased in 2000 compared to 1999 as a

result of (1) the Company’s increased hiring of sales, operations, and

administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases

in business activity and (2) increased compensation levels.  Salaries and related costs decreased 1% as a

percentage of net revenues.  Management

believes that this decrease is due to the Company’s ability to service larger

freight volumes with a relatively smaller group of people.  Management attributes this to technological

enhancement and operational process improvement initiatives.  The relatively consistent relationship

between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy

that has been maintained since the inception of the Company: offer a modest

base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage

of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key

employee.  Using this compensation

model, changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes

in Company profits.  Management believes

that the growth in revenues, net revenues and net earnings for 2000 are a

result of the incentives inherent in the Company’s compensation program.

Other operating expenses increased in 2000 as compared with 1999 as

rent expense, communications expense, quality and training expenses, and other

costs expanded to accommodate the Company’s growing operations.  Other operating expenses as a percentage of

net revenues decreased 1% in 2000 as compared with 1999.

Other income, net, increased in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due

to interest income earned on higher cash balances and short-term investments in

2000.  Management attributes higher cash

balances, in large part, to the success of cash management and billing

improvement initiatives.

The Company pays income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions,

as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of

operations.  The Company’s consolidated

effective income tax rate remained relatively constant in 2000 at 37.7%.

Currency and Other Risk Factors

International air/ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are

intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable

future.  There are a large number of

entities competing in the international logistics industry; however, the

Company’s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of

companies within this group.  While

there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into

large firms with multinational offices and agency networks, regional and local

broker/forwarders remain a competitive force.

Historically, the primary competitive factors in the international

logistics industry have been price and quality of service, including

reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of

operations.  The Company emphasizes

quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of

others in the industry.  Customers have

exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the

management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as

just-in-time inventory management. 

Accordingly, sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities

and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting

and retaining customers.

Developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a

considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers.  Smaller and middle-tier competitors, in

general, do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and

a worldwide network.  As a result, there

is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the

industry.  Management expects that this

trend toward consolidation will continue for the short- to medium-term.


The nature of the Company’s worldwide operations necessitates the

Company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.  This results in the Company being exposed to

the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental

interference.  Some of the countries

where the Company maintains offices and/or agency relationships have strict

currency control regulations which influence the Company’s ability to hedge

foreign currency exposure.  The Company

tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency

settlements among its offices or agents. 

The Company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in

limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the

Company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the short-term

financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most

time-sensitive way to avoid short-term exchange losses.  Any such hedging activity during 2001, 2000

and 1999 was insignificant.  Net foreign

currency losses realized in 2001 were $366,000.  Net foreign currency gains realized during 2000 and 1999 were

$309,000 and $196,000, respectively. 

The current year losses were recognized primarily as a result of

intercompany obligations with the Company’s subsidiaries in Brazil, Taiwan,

Indonesia and Turkey.

The Company has traditionally generated revenues from airfreight, ocean

freight and customs brokerage and import services.  In light of the customer-driven trend to provide customer rates

on a door-to-door basis, management foresees the potential, in the medium- to

long-term, for fees normally associated with customs house brokerage to be

de-emphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the

Company.

On January 1, 1999, eleven of fifteen member countries of the European

Union, later joined by Greece in January 2001, established fixed conversion

rates between their existing currencies (“legacy currencies”) and a new common

currency - the Euro.  The Euro trades on

currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions.  The conversion to the Euro eliminates

currency exchange rate risk between the member countries.  Beginning in January 2002, new Euro-denominated

bills and coins were issued and legacy currencies began to be withdrawn from

circulation. The Company has worked diligently to address the issues raised by

the Euro currency conversion including the need to adapt computer systems and

business processes to accommodate Euro-denominated transactions.  The conversion costs were not material. Due

to numerous uncertainties, the Company is evaluating the effects one common

European currency will have on pricing. 

The Company is unable to predict the resulting impact, if any, on the

Company’s consolidated financial statements.  

The Company has not experienced any significant disruption as a result

of this phased conversion.

Sources of Growth

Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a

challenge for many of the Company’s competitors and typically involves the

purchase of significant “goodwill”, the value of which can be realized in large

measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired

business.  As a result, the Company has

pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic

acquisitions, where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the

“goodwill” recorded in the transaction.


Office Additions

The Company opened 7 start-up offices and one office through an

acquisition during 2001.  The office

added through an acquisition is followed by an asterisk.

Internal Growth

Management believes that a comparison of  “same store” growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality

and extent of the Company’s internally generated growth.  This “same store” analysis isolates the

financial contributions from offices that have been included in the Company’s

operating results for at least one full year. 

The table below presents “same store” comparisons on a year-over-year

basis for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s

principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities.  Net cash provided by operating activities

for the year ended December 31, 2001 was approximately $168 million, as

compared with $154 million for 2000. 

This $14 million increase is principally due to increased net earnings,

decreased accounts receivable and

increased accounts payable, accrued expenses and taxes payable.

The Company’s

business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. 

Cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality.  Historically, the first quarter shows an

excess of customer collections over customer billings.  This results in positive cash flow.  The increased activity associated with peak

season (typically commencing late second or early third quarter) causes an

excess of customer billings over customer collections.  This cyclical growth in customer receivables

consumes available cash.  In the past,

the Company has utilized short-term borrowings to satisfy normal operating

expenditures when temporary cash outflows exceed cash inflows.  These short-term borrowings have been repaid

when the trend reverses and customer collections exceed customer billings.  During 2001, short-term borrowings were not

required in the United States; the market where cash flow pressures are most

intense due to funds advanced in association with customs brokerage activity.

As a customs

broker, the Company can make significant 5-10 business day cash advances for

the payment of duties and freight. 

These advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of

credit-worthy customers.  Cash advances

are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component of revenue and

expense, but are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable and

accounts payable.  As a result of these

“pass through” billings, the conventional Days Sales Outstanding or DSO

calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency.

Cash used in

investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $53 million, as

compared with $29 million during the same period of 2000.  The largest use of cash in investing

activities is cash paid for capital expenditures.  For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company made capital

expenditures of $37 million as compared with $26 million


for the same period in 2000. 

Capital expenditures in 2001 and in 2000 related primarily to

investments in technology and office furniture and equipment.

Cash used in

financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $58 million as

compared with cash used in financing activities of $23 million for the same

period in 2000.  In 2001, the Company

paid down $3 million on short-term debt, as compared with $15 million for the

same period of 2000.  The Company uses

the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the Company’s stock on

the open market.  The differences shown at

year end of 2000

and 1999

between proceeds from the issuance of

common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock represent a timing

difference in the receipt of proceeds and the subsequent repurchase of

outstanding shares.  During the third

quarter of 2001, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase

1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.  The difference shown at the end of 2001 between proceeds from the

issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock is

primarily due to the repurchase of stock under the discretionary plan

authorized by the Board of Directors in September 2001.  The repurchase of all 1,000,000 shares was

completed on October 11, 2001 at an average price of $45.12 per share.  In

November 2001, the Board of Directors expanded the Company’s Discretionary

Stock Repurchase Program to allow for the repurchase of such shares as may be

necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 50,000,000 shares of

common stock.  As of December 31, 2001,

no shares had been repurchased under the amended discretionary plan.

At December 31,

2001, working capital was $237 million, including cash and short-term

investments of $219 million. The Company had no long-term debt at December 31,

2001.  While the nature of its business

does not require an extensive investment in property and equipment, the Company

cannot eliminate the possibility that it could acquire an equity interest in

property in certain geographic locations. 

The Company currently expects to spend approximately $40 million on

property and equipment in 2002.  In

addition to normal capital expenditures for leasehold improvements, warehouse

equipment, computer hardware and furniture and fixtures, this total includes

estimates for a building project in Egypt. 

The Company expects to finance capital expenditures in 2002, with cash.

The Company

borrows internationally under unsecured bank lines of credit.  The international bank lines of credit

totaled $9.4 million.  In addition, the

Company maintains a bank facility with its U.K. bank for $7.3 million.  At December 31, 2001, the Company was

directly liable for $1.7 million drawn on these lines of credit and was

contingently liable for an additional $28.6 million from standby letters of

credit and guarantees related to these lines of credit and other obligations.

At December 31,

2001, the Company's contractual obligations and other commitments are as

follows:


The Company has a Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to repurchase

shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises.  As of December 31, 2001,

the

Company had repurchased and retired 2,346,196 shares of common stock at

an average price of $20.82 per share over the period from 1994 through 2001.

The Company also has a Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan under which

it retired 1,000,000 shares of common stock as of October 11, 2001, at an

average

price of $45.12 per share.  In November 2001, this plan was expanded to

allow for the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the

issued and outstanding stock to 50,000,000 shares of common stock.  As of December 31, 2001, no shares had been

repurchased under the amended discretionary plan.

Management

believes that the Company’s current cash position, bank financing arrangements,

and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity

requirements for the foreseeable future.

In some cases, the

Company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to

foreign exchange controls.  At December

31, 2001, cash and cash equivalent balances of $96 million were held by the

Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries, of which $35 million was held in banks in the

United States.  In addition, certain

undistributed earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries accumulated through

December 31, 1992 would, under most circumstances, be subject to some

additional United States income tax if distributed to the Company.  The Company has not provided for this

additional tax because the Company intends to reinvest such earnings to fund

the expansion of its foreign activities, or to distribute them in a manner in

which no significant additional taxes would be incurred.

Impact of

Inflation

To date, the

Company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation, nor has the

Company experienced significant difficulty in passing carrier rate increases on

to its customers by means of price increases. 

Direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short- to medium-term

period.  Due to the high degree of

competition in the market place, these rate increases might lead to an erosion

in the Company’s margins.  However, as

the Company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and

equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest rate-sensitive

indebtedness, the Company currently has no direct exposure to increased costs

resulting from increases in interest rates.

The

forward-looking statements contained in this document involve a number of risks

and uncertainties.  Factors that could

cause actual results to differ materially from these statements include, but

are not limited to: risks associated with foreign operations, elimination of

intercompany transactions, matching of expenses with the associated revenue,

seasonality, shifts in consumer demand, the effect that the implementation of

the Euro as the primary currency of 12 member states of the European Union

might have on the global economy and the Company’s international and domestic

customers, other accounting estimates and other risk factors disclosed from

time to time in the Company’s public reports.


ITEM 7A —

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is

exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business.  These risks are primarily related to foreign

exchange risk and changes in short-term interest rates.   The potential impact of the Company’s

exposure to these risks is presented below:

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company conducts business in many different countries and

currencies.  The Company’s business

often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which

differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred.  In the ordinary course of business, the

Company creates numerous intercompany transactions.  This brings a market risk to the Company’s earnings.

Foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by

estimating the impact on the Company’s earnings as a result of hypothetical

changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar, the Company’s functional currency,

relative to the other currencies in which the Company transacts business.  All other things being equal, an average 10%

weakening of the U.S. Dollar, throughout the year ended December 31, 2001,

would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately $9.8

million.  An average 10% strengthening

of the U.S. Dollar, for the same period, would have the effect of reducing

operating income approximately $8 million.

The Company has approximately $10 million of intercompany transactions

unsettled at any one point in time.  The

Company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage

foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging

transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations

restrict the Company’s ability to move money freely around the world.  Any such hedging activity throughout the

year ended December 31, 2001, was insignificant.  The Company instead follows a policy of accelerating

international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to

intercompany billings.  The majority of

intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings

arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90 days.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2001, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and

short-term investments of  $218.7

million and short-term borrowings of $1.7 million, all subject to variable

short-term interest rates.  A

hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10% would have an insignificant

impact on the Company’s earnings.

In management’s opinion, there has been no material change in the

Company’s market risk exposure between 2000 and 2001.

Independent Auditors’ Report

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.:

We have audited

the consolidated balance sheets of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index.  In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial

statements, we have also audited the financial statement schedule as listed in

the accompanying index.  These

consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility

of the Company’s management.  Our

responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial

statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our

audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United

States of America.  Those standards

require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about

whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test

basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial

statements.  An audit also includes

assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by

management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

 We believe that our audits provide a

reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,

the consolidated financial statements referred to above, present fairly, in all

material respects, the financial position of Expeditors International of

Washington, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the

results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the

three-year period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting

principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial

statement schedule, when considered in relation to the consolidated financial

statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the

information set forth therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.            Basis of

Presentation

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (“the Company”) is a

global logistics company operating through a worldwide network of offices,

international service centers and exclusive or non-exclusive agents. The

Company’s customers include retailing and wholesaling, electronics, and

manufacturing companies around the world. 

The Company grants credit upon approval to customers.

International trade is influenced by many factors, including economic

and political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange

rates, and United States and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs,

trade restrictions, foreign investments and taxation.  Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to

current tariffs and trade restrictions. 

The Company cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals may be

adopted, nor can the Company predict the effects adoption of any such proposal

will have on the Company’s business. 

Doing business in foreign locations also subjects the Company to a

variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic

enterprises.  In addition to being

affected by governmental policies concerning international trade, the Company’s

business may also be affected by political developments and changes in

government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the

Company and its subsidiaries.  In

addition, the accounts of exclusive agents have been consolidated in those

circumstances where the Company maintains unilateral control over the agents’

assets and operations, notwithstanding a lack of technical majority ownership

of the agents’ common stock.

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been

eliminated in consolidation.

All dollar amounts in the notes are presented in thousands except for

share data.

B.            Short–term

Investments

Short–term investments are designated as available-for-sale and

cost approximates market at December 31, 2001 and 2000.

C.            Long-Lived Assets,

Depreciation and Amortization

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated or

amortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the assets’ estimated

useful lives or lease terms. Useful lives for major categories of property and

equipment are as follows:

Buildings

28 to 40 years

Furniture,

  fixtures and equipment

3 to 5 years

Vehicles

3 to 5 years

Expenditures

for maintenance, repairs, and renewals of minor items

are charged to earnings as incurred. 

Major renewals and improvements are capitalized.  Upon disposition, the cost and related

accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain

or loss is included in income for the period.

The excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets of

acquired businesses (included in other assets, net) is amortized on the

straight-line method over periods up to 40 years.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)

No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Assets to

Be Disposed Of,”

long-lived assets (property and equipment) and certain

intangible assets (excess costs over the fair value of the net assets of

acquired businesses) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in

circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be

recoverable.  Recoverability of

long-term assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of such

assets against the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by

the assets.  If such assets are

determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the

amount by which the assets’ carrying amounts exceeds the assets’ discounted

future cash flows.

F-6

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued

SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations” effective July 1, 2001, and SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” effective for fiscal years beginning

after December 15, 2001. Under the new rules, purchased goodwill and intangible

assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized but will be

subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the provisions of the

statements. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives will continue to be

amortized over their respective useful lives, and reviewed for impairment in

accordance with SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived

Assets and for Assets to Be Disposed Of”. 

The Company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and

intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of 2002. Application of the non-amortization

provisions of the statement is not expected to have a material effect on the

Company’s financial statements. The Company performed the required impairment

tests of goodwill as of January 1, 2002 and determined there is no impact on

the earnings and financial position of the Company.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset

Retirement Obligations” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for

obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and

for the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal

obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result

from the acquisition, construction or development and/or normal use of the

asset. The Company is required and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS No.

143 beginning in the first quarter of 2003.

In October 2001, SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or

Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” was issued which addresses financial accounting

and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. While this

standard supersedes SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived

Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of”, it retains many of the

fundamental provisions of that standard. SFAS No. 144 also supersedes the

accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the

Results of Operations – Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a

Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and

Transactions”, for the disposal of a segment of a business. The Company is

required and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 144 beginning in the

first quarter of 2002.

Management does not anticipate that adoption of SFAS No. 143 and No.

144 will result in a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial

condition or results of operations.

D.            Revenues and Revenue Recognition

Airfreight revenues include the charges to the Company for carrying the

shipments when the Company acts as a freight consolidator.  Ocean freight revenues include the charges

to the Company for carrying the shipments when the Company acts as a Non-Vessel

Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC). 

Revenues realized in other capacities include only the commissions and

fees earned.

Revenues related to shipments are recognized at the time the freight is

tendered to a direct carrier at origin. 

All other revenues, including breakbulk services, local transportation,

customs formalities, distribution services and logistics management, are

recognized upon performance.

E.             Income Taxes

Income taxes are

accounted for under the asset and liability method of accounting.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and

liabilities

are recognized for the

future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial

statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their

respective tax bases, the tax effect of loss carryforwards and tax credit

carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and

liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable

income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be

recovered or settled.  The effect on

deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in

income in the period that includes the enactment date.

F-7

F.             Net Earnings per

Common Share

Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average

number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding.  Dilutive potential common shares represent

outstanding stock options.  Basic

earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average of common shares

outstanding without taking into consideration dilutive potential common shares

outstanding.

G.            Foreign Currency

Foreign currency amounts attributable to foreign operations have been

translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates for assets and

liabilities, historical rates for equity, and average annual rates for revenues

and expenses.  Unrealized gains or

losses arising from fluctuations in the year-end exchange rates are generally recorded

as components of other comprehensive income as adjustments from foreign

currency translation.  Currency

fluctuations are a normal operating factor in the conduct of the Company’s

business and exchange transaction gains and losses are generally included in

freight consolidation expenses.

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging

Activities” established accounting standards for derivative and hedging

transactions. The Statement became effective for fiscal years beginning after

June 15, 2000.  Adoption of this

standard by the Company on January 1, 2001, had no material impact on the

Company’s consolidated financial statements. 

The Company follows a policy of accelerating international currency

settlements to manage its foreign exchange exposure.  Accordingly, the Company enters into foreign currency hedging

transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial

limitations on the Company’s ability to move money freely around the

world.  Such hedging activity during

2001, 2000 and 1999 was insignificant. 

Net foreign currency loss realized during 2001 was $366.  Net foreign currency gains realized during

2000 and 1999 were $309 and $196, respectively.

H.            Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less

at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

I.              Comprehensive

Income

Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses

affecting shareholders’ equity that, under generally accepted accounting

principles in the United States, are excluded from net income.  For the Company, these consist of foreign

currency translation gains and losses, net of related income tax effects.

J.

Segment

Reporting

The Company is organized functionally in geographic operating

segments.  Accordingly, management

focuses its attention on revenues, net revenues, operating income, identifiable

assets, capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization and equity

generated in

each of these

geographical areas when evaluating effectiveness of geographic management.  The Company charges its subsidiaries and

affiliates for services rendered in the United States on a cost recovery

basis.  Transactions among the Company’s

various offices are conducted using the same arms-length pricing methodologies

the Company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents.

K.

Use

of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally

accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and

assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and

disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial

statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the

period.  Actual results could differ

from those estimates.

L.             Reclassification

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the

2001 presentation.

F-8

NOTE 2. CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

The majority of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries maintain bank lines

of credit for short-term working capital purposes.  These credit lines are supported by standby letters of credit

issued by a United States bank, or guarantees issued by the Company to the

foreign banks issuing the credit line. 

Lines of credit totaling $9,396 and $11,054 at December 31, 2001 and

2000, respectively, bear interest at .5% to 1.5% over the foreign banks’

equivalent prime rates.  At December 31,

2001 and 2000, the Company was liable for $1,706 and $4,671, respectively, of

borrowings under these lines, and at December 31, 2001 was contingently liable

for approximately $28,614 under outstanding standby letters of credit and

guarantees related to these lines of credit and other obligations.

In addition, at

December 31, 2001 the Company had a $7,294 credit facility with a United

Kingdom bank (U.K. facility), secured by a corporate guarantee.  The Company was contingently liable under

the U.K. facility at December 31, 2001 for $7,294 used to secure customs bonds

issued by foreign governments.

At December 31,

2001, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants of these

credit lines and the associated credit facilities, including maintenance of

certain minimum asset, working capital and equity balances and ratios.

NOTE 3. INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense

for 2001, 2000 and 1999 includes the following components:

Income tax expense differs from amounts computed by applying the U.S.

Federal income tax rate of 35% to earnings before income taxes as a result of

the following:

F-9

The components of

earnings before income taxes are as follows:

The

tax effects of

temporary

differences, tax credits and operating loss carryforwards that give rise to

significant portions of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December

31, 2001 and 2000 are as follows:

At December 31, 2001, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards

for foreign income tax purposes of $4 which are available over an indefinite

period to offset future foreign taxable income.

The Company has not

provided U.S. Federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries

accumulated through December 31, 1992 since the Company intends to reinvest

such earnings indefinitely or to distribute them in a manner in which no

significant additional taxes would be incurred.  Such undistributed earnings are approximately $41,900 and the

additional Federal and state taxes payable in a hypothetical distribution of

such accumulated earnings would approximate $10,100.  Since 1993, the Company has been providing for Federal and state

income tax expense on foreign earnings without regard to whether such earnings

will be permanently reinvested outside the United States.

NOTE 4. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

A.            Dividends

On May 5, 1999, the Board

of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split, effected in the form of a stock

dividend of one share of common stock for every share outstanding, and

increased the authorized common stock to 160,000,000 shares.  The stock dividend was distributed on May

31, 1999 to shareholders of record on May 17, 1999. All share and per share

information, except par value, has been adjusted for all years to reflect the

stock split.

F-10

B.            Stock Repurchase

Plans

The Company has a

Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan under which management is authorized to

repurchase up to 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock in the open

market with the proceeds received from the exercise of Employee and Director

Stock Options.  As of December 31, 2001,

the Company had repurchased and retired 2,346,196 shares of common stock at an

average price of $20.82 per share over the period from 1994 through 2001.

In September 2001, the Board of Directors approved

a Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to repurchase

and retire

1,000,000 shares of common stock.  As of

October 11, 2001, all 1,000,000 shares had been repurchased and retired under

the plan at an average price of $45.12 per share.  In November 2001, the Board of Directors expanded the Company’s

Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to allow for the repurchase of such shares

as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 50,000,000

shares of common stock.  As of December

31, 2001, no shares had been repurchased under the amended discretionary plan.

C.            Stock Option Plans

The Company has two stock

option plans (the “1985 Plan” and the “1997 Plan”) for employees under which

the Board of Directors may grant officers and key employees options to purchase

common stock at prices equal to or greater than market value on the date of

grant.  The 1985 Plan provides for

non-qualified grants at exercise prices equal to or greater than the market

value on the date of grant. Outstanding options generally vest and become

exercisable over periods up to five years from the date of grant and expire no

more than 10 years from the date of grant. The 1997 Plan provides for qualified

and non-qualified grants of options to purchase shares, limited to not more

than 100,000 per person per year. 

Grants less than or equal to 20,000 shares in any fiscal year, are

granted at or above common stock prices on the date of grant.  Any 1997 Plan grants in excess of the

initial 20,000 shares granted per person per year (“Excess Grants”) require an

exercise price of not less than 120% of the common stock price on the date of

grant.  Excess Grants expire no later

than 5 years from the date of grant. 

Excess Grants under the 1997 Plan

vested

completely, 3 years from the date of grant.

The Company also has a stock option plan (“Directors’ Plan”) under

which non-employee directors elected at each annual meeting are granted

non-qualified options to purchase 8,000 shares of common stock on the first

business day of the month following the meeting.

Upon the exercise of

non-qualified stock options, the Company derives a tax deduction measured by

the excess of the market value over the option price at the date of

exercise.  The related tax benefit is

credited to additional paid-in capital.

F-11

Details regarding the

plans are as follows:

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in

accounting for its stock option and its employee stock purchase rights

plans.  Accordingly, no compensation cost

has been recognized for its fixed stock option or employee stock purchase

rights plans.  Had compensation cost for

the Company’s three stock based compensation and employee stock purchase rights

plans been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net earnings,

basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share would have been

decreased to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

F-12

The fair value of each

option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black–Scholes

option pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants:

The following table summarizes information about fixed–price

stock options outstanding at December 31, 2001:

D.

Basic

and Diluted Earnings Per Share

The following table reconciles the numerator and the denominator of the

basic and diluted per share computations for earnings per share in 2001, 2000

and 1999.

E.             Stock Purchase Plan

The Company’s 1988 Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides for 2,800,000

shares of the Company’s common stock to be reserved for issuance upon exercise

of purchase rights granted to employees who elect to participate through

regular payroll deductions beginning August 1 of each year.  The purchase rights are exercisable on July

31 of the following year at a price equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair
