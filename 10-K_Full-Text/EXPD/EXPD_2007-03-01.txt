The Company was
incorporated in the State of Washington in May 1979.  Its executive offices are located at 1015
Third Avenue, 12

th

Floor, Seattle, Washington, and its telephone
number is (206) 674-3400.

The Company’s internet address is
http://www.expeditors.com.  The Company
makes available free of charge through its internet website its annual report
on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and
all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such
material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC).

For information concerning the amount of revenues, net
revenues, operating income, identifiable assets, capital expenditures and
depreciation and amortization attributable to the geographic areas in which the
Company conducts its business, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial
statements.

Beginning in 1981, the Company’s primary business
focus was on airfreight shipments from Asia to the United States and related
customs brokerage and other services.  In the mid-1980’s, the Company
began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight, ocean freight
and distribution services.  Today the Company offers a complete range of
global logistics services to a diversified group of customers, both in terms of
industry specialization and geographic location.  As opportunities for
profitable growth arise, the Company plans to create new offices.  While
the Company has historically expanded through organic growth, the Company has
also been open to growth through acquisition of, or establishing joint ventures
with, existing agents or others within the industry.

Airfreight Services

Airfreight services accounted for approximately 37,
37, and 39 percent of the Company’s 2006, 2005, and 2004 consolidated revenues
net of freight consolidation expenses (“net revenues”), respectively. 
When performing airfreight services, the Company typically acts either as a
freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the
shipment.  When acting as a freight consolidator, the Company purchases
cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its
customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from
airlines.  When moving shipments between points where the volume of
business does not facilitate consolidation, the Company receives and forwards
individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment.
Whether acting as an agent or consolidator, the Company offers its customers
knowledge of optimum routing, familiarity with local business practices,
knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures, the ability to
arrange for ancillary services, and assistance with space availability in
periods of peak demand.

In its airfreight forwarding operations, the Company
procures shipments from its customers, determines the routing, consolidates
shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point, and selects the
airline for transportation to the distribution point.  At the distribution
point, the Company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken
down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual
shipments to their final destinations.

The Company estimates its average airfreight
consolidation weighs approximately 3,500 to 4,500 pounds and a typical
consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers.  Because
shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation, air
shipments are generally characterized by a high value-to-weight ratio, the need
for rapid delivery, or both.

The Company typically delivers shipments from a
Company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight
into containers or onto pallets.  Shipments normally arrive at the
destination distribution point within forty-eight hours after such
delivery.  During peak shipment periods, cargo space available from the
scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may
occur.  When these conditions exist, the Company may charter aircraft to
meet customer demand.

The Company consolidates individual shipments based on
weight and volume characteristics in cost-effective combinations. Typically, as
the weight or volume of a shipment increases, the cost per pound/kilo or cubic
inch/centimeter charged by the Company decreases.  The rates charged by
airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or
volume of the shipment increases.  As a result, by aggregating shipments
and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment, the Company is able to
obtain


a lower rate per
pound/kilo or cubic inch/centimeter than that which it charges to its customers
for the individual shipment, while generally offering the customer a lower rate
than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment.

The Company’s net airfreight forwarding revenues from
a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to
the Company by an airline and the rate which the Company charges to its
customers, commissions paid to the Company by the airline carrying the freight
and fees for ancillary services.  Such ancillary services provided by the
Company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation, packing, crating
and insurance services, negotiation of letters of credit, and preparation of
documentation to comply with local export laws.  When the Company acts as
an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment, its net revenues
are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for
ancillary services paid by the customer.

The Company does not own aircraft and does not plan to
do so.  Management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject
the Company to undue business risks, including large capital outlays, increased
fixed operating expenses, problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition
with airlines.  Because the Company relies on commercial airlines to
transport its shipments, changes in carrier policies and practices such as
pricing, payment terms, scheduling, and frequency of service may affect its
business.

The Company also performs breakbulk services which
involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging
for distribution of the individual shipments.  Breakbulk service revenues
also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipments.

Ocean Freight and Ocean Services

Ocean freight services accounted for approximately 25,
25, and 23 percent of the Company’s 2006, 2005, and 2004 consolidated net
revenues, respectively.  The Company’s revenues as an ocean freight
forwarder are derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from
fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the Company may provide,
such as preparing documentation, procuring insurance, arranging for packing and
crating services, and providing consultation.  The Company operates
Expeditors International Ocean (“EIO”) an Ocean Transportation Intermediary,
sometimes referred to as, a Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (“NVOCC”)
specializing in ocean freight consolidation from Asia to the United
States.  EIO also provides service, on a
smaller scale, to and from any location where the Company has an office or
agent.  As an NVOCC, EIO contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain
transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a
specified time period at an agreed rate.  EIO solicits Less-than Container
Load (“LCL”) freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those
available directly from shipping lines.  EIO also handles full container
loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to
negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers.  The
Company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the
cargo.

Expeditors Cargo Management Systems (“ECMS”) supplies
a sophisticated ocean consolidation service.  The Company owns and
maintains software that allows it to sell ECMS to large volume customers that
have signed their own service contracts with the ocean carriers.  As an
ocean consolidator, ECMS may obtain LCL freight from several vendors and
consolidate this cargo into full containers.  The Company’s revenues as an
ocean consolidator are derived from handling LCL cargo at origin and from the
fees paid by customers for access to data captured during the consolidation
process.

Customs Brokerage and Other Services

Customs brokerage and other services accounted for
approximately 38 percent of each of the Company’s 2006, 2005, and 2004
consolidated net revenues, respectively.  As a customs broker, the Company
assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required
documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the
importer, arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies, and
arranging for delivery.  The Company also provides other value added
services at destination such as warehousing and product distribution, time
definite transportation and inventory management.  None of these other
services are currently individually significant to the Company’s net revenues.

The Company provides customs clearance services in
connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder. 
However, substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that
elect to use a competing forwarder.   Conversely, shipments handled
by the Company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker
selected by the customer.

The Company also provides custom clearances for goods
moving by rail and truck between the United States, Canada and/or Mexico. 
The commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border
brokerage business require the Company to continue to make enhancements to its
systems in order to provide competitive service.

The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Expeditors
Tradewin, L.L.C., responds to customer driven requests for high-end customs
consulting services.  The demand for these services was stimulated by the
changes made by Customs and Border Protection of the Department of Homeland
Security in response to the 1993 Customs Modernization Act.  Fees for these non-transactional services are
based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed procedures.


Marketing and Customers

The Company provides flexible service and seeks to
understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate
destinations.  Although the domestic importer usually designates the
logistics company and the services that will be required, the foreign shipper
may also participate in this selection process.  Therefore, the Company
coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their
overseas suppliers.

The Company’s marketing efforts are focused primarily
on the traffic, shipping and purchasing departments of existing and potential
customers.  The district manager of each office is responsible for
marketing, sales coordination, and implementation in the area in which he or
she is located.  All employees are responsible for customer service and relations.

The Company staffs its offices largely with managers
and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate
and who have extensive experience in global logistics.  Marketing and
customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the Company’s services
directly to local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the
selection of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive
timely and efficient service.  The Company believes that its expertise in
supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers, its emphasis on
coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing
activities, and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important
elements of its success.

The goods handled by the Company are generally a
function of the products which dominate international trade between any
particular origin and destination.  Shipments of computer components,
other electronic equipment, housewares, sporting goods, machine parts, and
toys, comprise a significant percentage of the Company’s business. 
Typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of
consumer electronics, department store chains, clothing and shoe wholesalers,
manufacturers and catalogue stores.  Historically, no single customer has
accounted for five percent or more of the Company’s revenues.

Competition

The global logistics services industry is intensely
competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. 
There are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the
industry, but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full
complement of logistics services is more limited.  Depending on the
location of the shipper and the importer, the Company must compete against both
the niche players and larger entities.  While there is currently a marked
trend within the industry toward consolidation into larger firms striving for
immediate multinational and multi-service networks, the regional and local
competitors maintain a strong market presence.

Historically, the primary competitive factors in the
global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service,
including reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of
operations.  The Company emphasizes quality service and believes that its
prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry. 
Recently, larger customers have exhibited a trend toward more sophisticated and
efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by
embracing strategies such as just-in-time inventory management.  This
trend has made computerized customer service capabilities a significant factor
in attracting and retaining customers.  These computerized customer
service capabilities include customized Electronic Data Interchange, (“EDI”),
and on-line freight tracing and

tracking applications.  The customized EDI
applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers’
systems and the Company’s systems.  Freight tracing and tracking
applications provide customers with real time visibility to the location,
transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit.

Management believes that the ability to develop and
deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’ increasingly sophisticated
information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the
Company.  Accordingly, the Company has devoted a significant amount of
resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet
these customer demands.  Management believes that the Company’s existing
systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics
services companies with which it competes.

Unlike many of its competitors, who have tended to
grow by merger and acquisition, the Company operates the same accounting and
transportation computer software, running on a common hardware platform, in all
of its full-service locations.  Small and middle-tier competitors, in
general, do not have the resources available to develop these customized
systems.  As a result, there is a significant amount of consolidation
currently taking place in the industry.  Management expects that this
trend toward consolidation will continue for the short- to medium-term. 
Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a
challenge for many of the Company’s competitors and typically involves the
purchase of significant “goodwill.”  As a result, the Company has pursued
a strategy

emphasizing
organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions.


The Company’s ability to attract, retain, and motivate
highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an
essential, if not the most important, element of its ability to compete in the
industry.  To this end, the Company has adopted incentive compensation
programs which make percentages of branch revenues or profits available to
managers for distribution among key personnel.  The Company believes that
these incentive compensation programs, combined with its experienced personnel
and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts, provide it with a
distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that
competitors have generally matched only through acquisition.

Currency and Other Risk Factors

The nature of the Company’s worldwide operations
necessitate the Company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the
U.S. dollar.  This results in the Company being exposed to the inherent
risks of the international currency markets and governmental
interference.  Many of the countries where the Company maintains offices
and/or agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which
influence the Company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure.  The
Company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international
currency settlements among these offices or agents.

In addition, the Company’s ability to provide service
to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a
variety of entities including airlines, steamship lines and governmental
agencies.  The Company considers its current working relationships with
these entities to be good.  However, changes in space allotments available
from carriers, governmental deregulation efforts, “modernization” of the
regulations governing customs clearance, and/or changes in governmental quota
restrictions could affect the Company’s business in unpredictable ways.

Seasonality

Historically, the Company’s operating results have
been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis.  The
first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth
quarters have traditionally been the strongest.  This pattern has been the
result of, or influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national
holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and a myriad of other similar
and subtle forces.  In addition, this historical quarterly trend has been
influenced by the growth and diversification of the Company’s international
network and service offerings.  The Company cannot accurately forecast
many of these factors, nor can the Company estimate accurately the relative
influence of any particular factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance
that historical patterns will continue in future periods.

A significant portion of the Company’s revenues are
derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely
to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are
dependent upon just-in-time production schedules. Therefore, the timing of the
Company’s revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of the
Company’s control, such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and
manufacturing production delays.  Additionally, many customers ship a
significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and
therefore, the Company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a
quarter.  To the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not
expected by securities analysts, any such shortfall from levels predicted by
securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading
price of the Company’s stock.

Environmental

In the United States, the Company is subject to
Federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into
the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment. 
Similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the Company
operates.  Although current operations have not been significantly affected
by compliance with these environmental laws, governments are becoming
increasingly sensitive to environmental issues, and the Company cannot predict
what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business. 
The Company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for
environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or
succeeding fiscal years.

Employees

At January 31, 2007, the Company employed
approximately 11,600 people, 4,390 in the United States and 660 in the balance
of North America, 590 in South America, 1,570 in Europe, 3,250 in
Asia & Australasia, 850 in the Near/Middle East and 290 in
Africa.  Approximately 1,650 of the Company’s employees are engaged
principally in sales and marketing and customer service, 7,100 in operations
and 2,850 in finance and administration.  The Company is not a party to
any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its
employees to be satisfactory.

In order to retain the services of highly qualified,
experienced, and motivated employees, the Company places considerable emphasis
on its non-equity incentive compensation programs and stock option plans.

Regulation and Security

With respect to the Company’s activities in the air
transportation industry in the United States, it is subject to regulation by
the Transportation Security Administration of the Department of Homeland
Security as an indirect air carrier.  The Company’s overseas offices and
agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of
operation.  The Company is licensed in each of its offices or, in the case
of its newer offices, has made application for a license as an airfreight
forwarder by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”).  IATA is a voluntary association of airlines
and air transport related entities which prescribes certain operating
procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members. 
The majority of the Company’s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with
airlines which are IATA members.

The Company is licensed as a customs broker by Customs
and Border Protection (“CBP”) of the Department of Homeland Security in each
U.S. customs district in which it does business.  All United States
customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to
periodic audits by CBP.  Additionally, the Company participates in
government supply chain security programs such as Customs-Trade Partnership
Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT”) in the United States.  In other jurisdictions in which the Company
performs clearance services, the Company is licensed by the appropriate
governmental authority.

The Company is registered as an Ocean Transportation
Intermediary (“OTI”) (sometimes referred to as NVOCC-Non-Vessel Owned Common
Carrier) by the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”).  The FMC has
established certain qualifications for shipping agents, including certain
surety bonding requirements.  The FMC also is responsible for the economic
regulation of OTI/NVOCC activity originating or terminating in the United
States.  To comply with these economic regulations, vessel operators and
NVOCCs, such as EIO, are required to file tariffs electronically which
establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities
into and out of the United States.  The FMC has the power to enforce these
regulations by assessing penalties.

The Company does not believe that current United
States and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic
restraint upon its business operations.  In general, the Company conducts
its business activities in each country through a majority-owned subsidiary
corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that
country.  However, the regulations of foreign governments can impose
barriers to the Company’s ability to provide the full range of its business
activities in a wholly or majority United States-owned subsidiary.  For
example, foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in
some jurisdictions


and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight
forwarding and/or freight consolidation is restricted to local entities. 
When the Company encounters this sort of governmental restriction, it works to
establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local
regulations while also giving the Company the substantive operating and
economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation.
This can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency
relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required
license.  In cases where the Company has unilateral control over the
assets and operations of the local entity, notwithstanding the lack of
technical majority ownership of common stock, the Company consolidates the
accounts of the local entity.  In such cases, consolidation is necessary
to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the
Company because of the existence of the parent-subsidiary relationship by means
other than record ownership of voting common stock.

The war on terror and governments’ overriding concern
for the safety of passengers and citizens who import and/or export goods into
and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo
security regulations over the past several years.  While these cargo regulations have already
created a marked difference in the security arrangements required to move
shipments around the globe, regulations are expected to become more stringent in
the future.  As governments look for ways
to minimize the exposure of  their
citizens to potential terror related incidents, the Company and its competitors
in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security
procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been
required in the past.  The Company feels
that increased security requirements may involve further investments in
technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to
potential customers, vendors and employees. 
While many of these regulations have not been finalized at this time, it
is the Company’s position that much of the increased costs of compliance with
security regulations will need to be passed through to those who are beneficiaries
of the Company’s services.

Cargo Liability

When acting as an airfreight consolidator, the Company
assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments. This legal
liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction
value or the released value ($9.07 per pound unless the customer declares a
higher value and pays a surcharge), except if the loss or damage is caused by
willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill.  The
airline which the Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally
liable to the Company in the same manner and to the same extent.  When
acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper, the Company does not
assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to
the airline.

When acting as an ocean freight consolidator, the
Company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments.  This
liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction
value or the released value ($500 per package or customary freight unit unless
the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge).  The steamship
line which the Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable
to the Company in the same manner and to the same extent.  In its ocean
freight forwarding and customs clearance operations, the Company does not
assume cargo liability.

When providing warehouse and distribution services,
the Company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount
generally equal to the lower of fair value or fifty cents per pound with a
maximum of fifty dollars per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that
the warehouse is required to track.  Upon payment of a surcharge for
warehouse and distribution services, the Company will assume additional
liability.

The Company maintains marine cargo insurance covering
claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is
legally liable.  The Company also maintains insurance coverage for the
property of others which is stored in Company warehouse facilities.  This
insurance coverage is provided by a Vermont based insurance entity wholly owned
by the Company.  The coverage is fronted and

reinsured by a global insurance company.  The
total risk retained by the Company in 2006 was approximately $4 million,
although actual and estimated losses are expected to be less.  In addition, the Company is licensed as an
insurance broker through its subsidiary, Expeditors Cargo Insurance
Brokers, Inc. and places stand alone insurance coverage for other
customers.


ITEM 1A — RISK FACTORS

RISK FACTORS

DISCUSSION
  AND POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE

International Trade

The Company primarily provides services to customers
  engaged in international commerce. Everything that affects international
  trade has the potential to expand or contract the Company’s primary market.
  For example, international trade is influenced by:

·

currency exchange rate and interest rate
  fluctuations;

·

changes in governmental policies;

·

changes in international and domestic
  customs regulations;

·

wars, acts of terrorism, and other
  conflicts;

·

natural disasters;

·

changes in consumer attitudes regarding
  goods made in countries other than their own; and

·

changes in the price and readily available
  quantities of oil and other petroleum-related products.

Third Party Vendors

The Company is a non-asset based supplier of global
  logistics services. As a result, the Company depends on a variety of
  asset-based third party vendors. The quality and profitability of the
  Company’s services depend upon effective selection, management and discipline
  of third party vendors.

Predictability of Results

The Company is not aware of any accurate means of
  forecasting short-term customer requirements. However, long-term customer
  satisfaction depends upon the Company’s ability to meet these unpredictable
  short-term customer requirements. Personnel costs, the Company’s single
  largest variable expense, are always less flexible in the very near term as
  the Company must staff to meet uncertain demand. As a result, short-term
  operating results could be disproportionately affected.

Foreign Operations

The majority of the Company’s revenues and operating
  income come from operations conducted outside the United States. To maintain
  a global service network, the Company may be required to operate in hostile
  locations and in dangerous situations.

Key Personnel

The Company is a service business. The quality of
  this service is directly related to the quality of the Company’s employees.
  Identifying, training and retaining key employees is essential to continued
  growth and future profitability. Continued loyalty to the Company will not be
  assured by contract.

Technology

Increasingly, the Company must compete based upon
  the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies utilized in performing
  its core businesses. Future results depend upon the Company’s success in the
  cost effective development and integration of communication and information
  systems technologies.

Growth

To date, the Company has relied primarily upon
  organic growth and has tended to avoid growth through acquisition. Future
  results will depend upon the Company’s ability to continue to grow internally
  or to demonstrate the ability to successfully identify and integrate
  non-dilutive acquisitions.

Regulatory Environment

As a publicly traded corporation, the Company is
  affected by regulations from a number of sources. The current business
  environment tends to stress the avoidance of risk through regulation and
  oversight, the effect of which is likely to be unforeseen costs and
  potentially unforeseen consequences.

In reaction to the global war on terror, governments
  around the world are continuously enacting or updating security regulations.
  The implementation of these regulations, including deadlines and substantive
  requirements, is driven by political urgencies rather than the industries’
  realistic ability to comply. Failure to timely comply may result in increased
  operating costs, restrictions on operations and/or fines and penalties.

*Company directly
owns 50% with Cargo Ventures, LLC, a private, non-affiliated real estate
development company.

The Company leases and maintains 71 additional offices
and satellite locations in the United States and 196 offices throughout the
world, each located close to an airport, ocean port, or on an important border
crossing.  The majority of these facilities contain warehouse
facilities.  Lease terms are either on a month-to-month basis or terminate
at various times through 2015.  See Note 7 to the Company’s consolidated
financial statements for lease commitments.  As an office matures, the
Company will investigate the possibility of building or buying suitable
facilities.  The Company believes that
current leases can be extended and that suitable alternative facilities are
available in the vicinity of each present facility should extensions be
unavailable at the conclusion of current leases.

— LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is ordinarily involved in claims and lawsuits
which arise in the normal course of business, none of which currently, in
management’s opinion, will have a material effect on the Company’s operations
or financial position.

In November 1993, the Company’s Board of Directors
authorized a Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan.  This plan was
amended in February 2001 to increase the authorization to repurchase up to 20
million shares of the Company’s common stock.  This authorization has no
expiration date.  This plan was disclosed in the Company’s report on Form
10-K filed March 31, 1995.  In the fourth quarter of 2006, 107,043 shares
were repurchased under the Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan.

In November 2001, under a Discretionary Stock
Repurchase Plan, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 200
million shares of common stock.  The maximum number of shares available
for repurchase under this plan will increase as the total number of outstanding
shares increase.  This authorization has no expiration date.  This
plan was announced on November 13, 2001.  In the fourth quarter of
2006, 308,749 shares were repurchased under the Discretionary Stock Repurchase
Plan.  These discretionary repurchases were made to keep the number of
issued and outstanding shares from growing as a result of stock option exercises.

SAFE
HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS UNDER SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995; CERTAIN CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

From time to time, the Company or its representatives
have made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in writing. 
Such forward-looking statements may be included in, but not limited to, press
releases, oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive
officer or in various filings made by the Company with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The words or phrases “will likely result”, “are expected
to”, “will continue”, “is anticipated”, “estimate”, “project” or similar
expressions are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act.  Such statements are
qualified in their entirety by reference to and are accompanied by the
discussion in Item 1A of certain important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.

The risks included in Item 1A are not
exhaustive.  Furthermore, reference is also made to other sections of this
report which include additional factors which could adversely impact the
Company’s business and financial performance.  Moreover, the Company
operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment.  New risk
factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to
predict all of such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all of such
risk factors on the Company’s business or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in any forward-looking statements.  Accordingly,
forward-looking statements cannot be relied upon as a guarantee of actual
results.

Shareholders should be aware that while the Company
does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against
the Company’s policy to disclose to such analysts any material non-public
information or other confidential commercial information.  Accordingly,
shareholders should not assume that the Company agrees with any statement or
report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of such statement or
report. Furthermore, the Company has a policy against issuing financial
forecasts or projections or confirming the accuracy of forecasts or projections
issued by others.  Accordingly, to the extent that reports issued by
securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such
reports are not the responsibility of the Company.


ITEM 7 — MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Executive Summary

Expeditors
International of Washington, Inc. is engaged in the business of global
logistics management, including international freight forwarding and
consolidation, for both air and ocean freight.  The Company acts as a
customs broker in all domestic offices, and in many of its international
offices.  The Company also provides additional services for its customers
including value-added distribution, purchase order management, vendor
consolidation and other logistics solutions.  The Company does not compete
for overnight courier or small parcel business.  The Company does not own
or operate aircraft or steamships.

International
trade is influenced by many factors, including economic and political
conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange rates, and United
States and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs, trade restrictions,
foreign investments, taxation, regional and global conflicts. 
Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and
trade restrictions.  The Company cannot predict which, if any, of these
proposals may be adopted, nor can the Company predict the effects the adoption
of any such proposal will have on the Company’s business.  Doing business
in foreign locations also subjects the Company to a variety of risks and
considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises.  In
addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international
trade, the Company’s business may also be affected by political developments
and changes in government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does
business.

The
Company derives its revenues from three principal sources:  1) airfreight,
2) ocean freight, and 3) customs brokerage and other services.  These are
the revenue categories presented in the financial statements.

The
Company is managed along four geographic areas of responsibility:  The Americas;
Asia; Europe, Africa, Near/Middle East and Indian Subcontinent (EMAIR); and
Australasia.  Each area is divided into sub-regions which are composed of
operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility.  The
Company’s business involves shipments between operating units and typically
touches more than one geographic area.  The nature of the international
logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation
among operating units.  Because of this inter-relationship between
operating units, it is very difficult to look at one geographic area and draw
meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the Company’s overall success
on a stand-alone basis.

The
Company’s operating units share revenue using the same arms-length pricing
methodologies the Company uses when its offices transact business with
independent agents.  The Company’s strategy closely links compensation
with operating unit profitability.  Individual success likely involves
cooperation with other operating units.

As a
non-asset based carrier, the Company does not own transportation assets. 
Rather, the Company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight
revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct (asset-based)
carriers and reselling those services to its customers.   The
difference between the rate billed to customers (the sell rate), and the rate
paid to the carrier (the buy rate) is termed “net revenue” or “yield.”  By
consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying
power, the Company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct
carriers, while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would
otherwise be able to negotiate themselves.

Customs
brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination, such
as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required
documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes
on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by
governmental agencies, and arranging for delivery.   This is a
complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and
regulations in the multitude of countries in which the Company has offices.

The
Company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on
good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines, ocean
steamship lines, and governmental agencies.  The significance of maintaining
acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and asset-based
providers involved in global trade has gained increased importance as a result
of ongoing concern over terrorism.  As each carrier labors to comply with
governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures,
inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade to some
degree.  A good reputation helps to develop practical working
understandings that will effectively meet security requirements while
minimizing potential international trade obstacles.  The Company considers
its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory. 
However, changes in space allotments available from carriers, governmental
deregulation efforts, “modernization” of the regulations governing customs
brokerage, and/or changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the
Company’s business in unpredictable ways.

Historically,
the Company’s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured
on a quarterly basis.  The first quarter has traditionally been the
weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the
strongest.  This pattern is the result of, or is influenced by, numerous
factors including climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic
conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces.  In addition,
this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and
diversification of the Company’s international network and service offerings. 
The Company cannot accurately forecast many of these


factors
nor can the Company estimate accurately the relative influence of any
particular factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance that historical
patterns, if any, will continue in future periods.

A
significant portion of the Company’s revenues are derived from customers in
retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand,
and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon
just-in-time production schedules.  Therefore, the timing of the Company’s
revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of the Company’s
control, such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods and/or
manufacturing production delays.  Additionally, many customers ship a
significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and
therefore, the Company may not learn of a shortfall in

revenues until late in a quarter. 
To the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by
securities analysts, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities
analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the
Company’s stock.

As
further discussed under liquidity and capital resources, total capital expenditures
in 2007 are expected to exceed $106 million.

In
terms of the opportunities, challenges and risks that management focused on in
2006, the Company operates in 60 countries throughout the world in the
competitive global logistics industry and Company activities are tied directly
to the global economy.  From the inception of the Company, management has
believed that the elements required for a successful global service
organization can only be assured through recruiting, training, and ultimately
retaining superior personnel.  The Company’s greatest challenge is now and
always has been perpetuating a consistent global culture which demands:

·

Total dedication, first and foremost, to providing
superior customer service;

·

Aggressive marketing of all of the Company’s service
offerings;

·

Ongoing development of key employees and management
personnel via formal and informal means;

·

Creation of unlimited advancement opportunities for
employees dedicated to hard work, personal growth and continuous improvement;

·

Individual commitment to the identification and
mentoring of successors for every key position so that when inevitable change
is required, a qualified and well-trained internal candidate is ready to step
forward; and

·

Continuous identification, design and implementation
of system solutions, both technological and otherwise, to meet and exceed the
needs of our customers while simultaneously delivering tools to make our
employees more efficient and more effective.

The
Company has reinforced these values with a compensation system that rewards
employees for profitably managing the things they can control.  There is
no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success.  
The Company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit
where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their
decisions.  At the same time, the Company insists on continued focus on
such things as accounts receivable collection, cash flow management and credit
soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic
errors that might end a career.

Any
failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a self-sustained basis throughout
the Company, provides a greater threat to the Company’s continued success than
any external force, which would be largely beyond our control. 
Consequently, management spends the majority of its time focused on creating an
environment where employees can learn and develop while also building systems
and taking preventative action to reduce exposure to negative
events.   The Company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible
to predict events that, in the aggregate, could have a positive or a negative
impact on future operations.  As a result our focus is on building and
maintaining a global culture of well-trained employees and managers that are
prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby
help the Company adapt and thrive as major trends emerge.

Critical
Accounting Estimates

A
summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1
to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.

Management
believes that the nature of the Company’s business is such that there are few,
if any, complex challenges in accounting for operations.


While judgments and
estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting, the Company’s
use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas that in the
aggregate are not a major component of the Company’s statement of earnings:

·

accounts receivable valuation;

·

the useful lives of long-term assets;

·

the accrual of costs related to
ancillary services the Company provides;

·

establishment of adequate insurance
liabilities for the portion of the freight related exposure which the Company
has self-insured; and

·

accrual of tax expense on an interim
basis.

Management believes that
the methods utilized in all of these areas are non-aggressive in approach and
consistent in application.  Management
believes that there are limited, if any, alternative accounting principles or
methods which could be applied to the Company’s transactions.  While the use of estimates means that actual
future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates, the
Company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such
estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported.

As described in Note 1 to
the consolidated financial statements in this report, effective January 1,
2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R. This accounting standard requires the
recognition of compensation expense based on an estimate of the fair value of
options granted to employees and directors under the Company’s stock option and
employee stock purchase plans.

This expense is recorded
ratably over the option vesting periods. The Company elected to utilize the
modified retrospective method of adoption and has restated all prior periods to
recognize the required stock compensation expense in accordance with the
requirements of SFAS 123R.

Determining the
appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense
requires judgment. Any option pricing model requires assumptions that are
subjective and these assumptions also require judgment. Examples include
assumptions about long-term stock price volatility, employee exercise patterns,
pre-vesting option forfeitures, post-vesting option terminations, and the interest
rates and dividend yields.

The Company has
historically used the Black-Scholes model for estimating the fair value of
stock options in providing pro forma fair value disclosures pursuant to SFAS
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123). After a review
of alternatives, and considering the guidance outlined in Securities and
Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107), the Company
has decided to continue to use this model for estimating the fair value of
stock options granted subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R.

In reviewing the
propriety of measurements and assumptions used historically to calculate
compensation expense for disclosure purposes, management considered the
guidance contained in SAB 107, even though all the Company’s stock options had
previously been granted under SFAS 123, as opposed to SFAS 123R, for which SAB
107 was expressly written.  The Company
began granting options under SFAS 123R in the second quarter of 2006.  Refer to Note 5D in the consolidated
financial statements for the assumptions used for grants issued during the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. 
The assumptions used by the Company for estimating the fair value of
options granted under SFAS 123R were developed on a basis consistent with
assumptions used for valuing previous grants.

Management believes that
these assumptions are appropriate, based upon the requirements of SFAS 123,
SFAS 123R, the guidance included in SAB 107 and the company’s historical and
currently expected future experience. Looking to future events, management has
been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid
predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be material.

The Company’s expected
volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s
stock. The expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee
exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination behavior. The risk-free
interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding
yield curve in effect at the time of grant for U.S. Treasury bonds having the
same term as the expected life of the option, i.e. a ten year bond rate is used
for valuing an option with a ten year expected life. The expected dividend
yield is based on the Company’s historical experience. The forfeiture rate used
to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical pre-vesting
employee forfeiture patterns.


The use of different
assumptions would result in different amounts of stock compensation expense.
Keeping all other variables constant, the indicated change in each of the
assumptions below increases or decreases the fair value of an option (and the
resulting stock compensation expense), as follows:

Assumption

Change in assumption

Impact of fair value of options

Expected volatility

Higher

Higher

Expected life of option

Higher

Higher

Risk-free interest rate

Higher

Higher

Expected dividend yield

Higher

Lower

The fair value of an option is more significantly
impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions.
The pre-vesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual
forfeiture rate. Therefore, changes in the forfeitures assumption would not
impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting
period. Different forfeitures assumptions would only impact the timing of
expense recognition over the vesting period. Estimated forfeitures will be
reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and
circumstances.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In June 2006, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ratified the Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) Issue 06-3, “How Taxes Collected From Customers and Remitted to
Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement,” (EITF
06-3). The scope of EITF 06-3 includes any tax assessed by a governmental
authority that is both imposed on and concurrent with a specific
revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer, including but
not limited to sales and value-added taxes. 
In EITF 06-3 a consensus was reached that entities may adopt a policy of
presenting these taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis.
If these taxes are significant, an entity should disclose its policy of
presenting taxes and the amount of taxes if reflected on a gross basis in the
income statement. EITF 06-3 is effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is required to and plans
to adopt EITF 06-3 in the first quarter of 2007.  The Company presents revenues net of sales
and value-added taxes in its consolidated statement of earnings and does not
anticipate changing its policy as a result of the adoption of EITF 06-3.

In June 2006, the FASB
issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”, (FIN 48).  FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the Company’s financial statements in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS 109).  The interpretation establishes guidelines for
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.  FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is required to and plans to
adopt the provisions of FIN 48 beginning in the first quarter of 2007.  The Company does not expect the adoption of
FIN 48 to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
condition or results of operations.

In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157).  SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles,
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies
under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting
pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute.
Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements.
SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. The Company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS 157
beginning in the first quarter of 2008. 
The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of SFAS
157.

In February 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities” (SFAS 159).  Under
the provisions of SFAS 159, Companies may choose to account for eligible
financial instruments, warranties and insurance contracts at fair value on a
contract-by-contract basis.  Changes in
fair value will be recognized in earnings each reporting period.  SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
within those fiscal years.  The Company
is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS 159 beginning in the
first quarter of 2008.  The Company is
currently assessing the impact of the adoption of SFAS 159.


Results of Operations

The following table shows
the consolidated net revenues (revenues less transportation expenses)
attributable to the Company’s principal services and the Company’s expenses for
2006, 2005, and 2004, expressed as percentages of net revenues.  Management believes that net revenues are a
better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the Company’s
principal services since total revenues earned by the Company as a freight
consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the Company for carrying the
shipment whereas revenues earned by the Company in its other capacities include
only the commissions and fees actually earned by the Company.

2006 compared with 2005

Airfreight net revenues
in 2006 increased 20% compared with 2005 primarily because of an increase in
airfreight volumes.  Global airfreight
tonnages in 2006 increased 18% compared with 2005.  Airfreight yields remained relatively
constant at 21% for 2006 as compared to 2005. 
The Company’s North American export airfreight net revenues increased
19% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily the result of increased market share
attributable to focused sales activity.  Airfreight
net revenues from Asia and from Europe increased 22% and 18%, respectively, for
2006 compared with 2005. These changes are the result of market pricing and
tonnage increases of 19% from Asia and 16 % from Europe.  Management attributes these tonnage increases
to effective sales efforts.

Ocean freight volumes,
measured in terms of forty-foot container equivalents (FEUs), increased 20%
over 2005 while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 24%
during the same period.  Ocean freight
yields increased 2% to 21% in 2006 as compared to 2005.

The Company continued its
focus of offering competitive rates to customers at the retail level, while
leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the
wholesale level.  The Company’s North
American ocean freight net revenues increased 28% in 2006 compared to
2005.  Ocean freight net revenues from
Asia increased 24% and from Europe increased 12% for 2006 compared with 2005.  The global increases in ocean freight net
revenue are primarily a result of market share expansion.


Customs brokerage and
other services net revenues increased 20% in 2006 as compared with 2005.  Management believes this increase is
attributable to increased market share as a result of the Company’s reputation
for providing high quality service and increased opportunities within the
customs brokerage market.  These
opportunities arise as customers seek out customs brokers with sophisticated
computerized capabilities.  In addition,
the Company’s customs brokerage offerings have benefited from increased
emphasis on regulatory compliance.

Salaries and related
costs increased 18% in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of (1) the Company’s
increased hiring of sales, operations, and administrative personnel in existing
and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and
(2) increased compensation levels.  As
previously noted, the Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified
retrospective application method and has restated all periods presented to
include compensation expense for all unvested stock options and share awards
beginning with the first period restated. 
Accordingly, salaries and related costs for the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005 have been increased to include compensation expense for the fair
value of unvested stock options.

The decline in salaries
and related costs as a percentage of net revenue for 2006 as compared with the
same period for 2005, can be attributed to leveraging increased business
volumes with improved productivity and increasing overall efficiency through
technological advances.  The effect of
including stock-based compensation expense in salaries and related costs for
2006 and 2005 are as follows:

Historically, the relatively consistent relationship
between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy
that has been maintained since the inception of the Company: offer a modest
base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage
of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee.  Using this compensation model, changes in
individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in Company profits.  Management believes that the growth in
revenues, net revenues and net earnings for 2006 are a result of the incentives
inherent in the Company’s compensation program.

Other overhead expenses
increased 7% in 2006 as compared with 2005 as rent expense, communications
expense, quality and training expenses, and other costs expanded to accommodate
the Company’s growing operations.  Other overhead
expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased 2% in 2006 as compared with
2005.  Management believes that this was
significant as it reflects the successful achievement of ongoing cost
containment objectives at the branch level.

Other income, net,
increased 31% in 2006 as compared with 2005. Due to higher interest rates on
higher average cash balances and short-term investments during 2006, interest
income increased by $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

The Company pays income
taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as other taxes
which are typically included in costs of operations.  The Company’s consolidated effective income
tax rate in 2006 of 40.6% increased when compared with the 31.2% rate in 2005.  The lower tax rate in 2005 is primarily the
result of the Company adopting a plan under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 965,
which was added by the American Jobs Creation Act.  In accordance with IRC 965, the Company
recorded a one-time tax benefit of $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.  In order to qualify for this credit, the
Company adopted a plan which required qualified capital expenditures of
approximately $105 million.  The Company
completed the required capital expenditures during 2006.  Additionally, income tax expense in 2005 has
been restated to include the tax benefit related to stock-based compensation
expense recorded as a result of applying the requirements of SFAS 123R under
the modified retrospective method. 
Although a tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense is
recorded for non-qualified stock options at the time the related compensation
expense is recognized, the tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions
of incentive stock options cannot be anticipated.  The higher consolidated effective income tax rate
for 2006 as compared to 2005 is partially the result of a smaller tax benefit
received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options during 2006
than was realized 2005.


2005 compared with 2004

Airfreight net revenues
in 2005 increased 12% compared with 2004 primarily because of an increase in
airfreight volumes.  Global airfreight
tonnages in 2005 increased 9% compared with 2004.  The 1% decrease in airfreight yields in 2005
was primarily a result of air carrier fuel surcharges which the Company
typically passes on without a profit element. 
The Company’s North American export airfreight net revenues increased
13% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily the result of increased market share
attributable to focused sales activity.  Airfreight
net revenues from Asia and from Europe increased 15% and 8%, respectively, for
2005 compared with 2004. These increases are the result of market price
increases, partially offset by yield declines of less than 1%, and increased
tonnage of 13% from Asia and 2% from Europe, primarily as a result of increased
sales success.

Ocean freight volumes,
measured in terms of forty-foot container equivalents (FEUs), increased 18%
over 2004 while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 23%
during the same period.  The increase in
net revenue can be attributed to cyclical market conditions and trade lane
imbalances.

The Company continued its
focus of offering competitive rates to customers at the retail level, while
leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the
wholesale level.  The Company’s North
American ocean freight net revenues increased 22% in 2005 compared to 2004.  Ocean freight net revenues from Asia
increased 31% and from Europe decreased 1% for 2005 compared with 2004.  The increase in North American and Asian
ocean freight net revenue are primarily a result of greater market share.  The decrease experienced in Europe is
primarily due to decreased export volumes which can be attributable to the relative
value of European currencies throughout the year.

Customs brokerage and
other services net revenues increased 18% in 2005 as compared with 2004.  This is a result of the Company’s reputation
for providing high quality service and increased opportunities within the
customs brokerage market.  These
opportunities arise as customers seek out customs brokers with sophisticated
computerized capabilities.  In addition,
the Company’s customs brokerage offerings have benefited from increased
emphasis on regulatory compliance.

Salaries and related
costs increased 16% in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of (1) the
Company’s increased hiring of sales, operations, and administrative personnel
in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and
(2) increased compensation levels.  As
previously noted, the Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified
retrospective application method and has restated all periods presented to
include compensation expense for all unvested stock options and share awards
beginning with the first period restated. 
Accordingly, salaries and related costs for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004 have been increased to include compensation expense for the fair
value of unvested stock options.

The decline in salaries
and related costs as a percentage of net revenue for 2005 as compared with the
same period for 2004, can be attributed to leveraging increased business
volumes with improved productivity and increasing overall efficiency through
technological advances.  The effect of
including stock-based compensation expense in salaries and related costs for
2005 and 2004 are as follows:

higher average cash balances and short-term investments during 2005, interest
income increased by $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.

The Company pays income
taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as other taxes
which are typically included in costs of operations.  The Company’s consolidated effective income
tax rate in 2005 of 31.2% decreased when compared with the 38.6% rate in 2004.  The lower tax rate in 2005 is primarily the
result of the Company adopting a plan under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 965,
which was added by the American Jobs Creation Act.  In accordance with IRC 965, the Company
recorded a one-time tax benefit of $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.  In order to qualify for this credit, the
Company adopted a plan which requires qualified capital expenditures of
approximately $105 million over the next two to three years.

Currency and Other Risk
Factors

International air/ocean
freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are
expected to remain so for the foreseeable future.  There are a large number of entities competing
in the international logistics industry; however, the Company’s primary
competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this
group.  While there is currently a marked
trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with
multinational offices and agency networks, regional and local broker/forwarders
remain a competitive force.

Historically, the primary
competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and
quality of service, including reliability, responsiveness, expertise,
convenience, and scope of operations.  The
Company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are
competitive with those of others in the industry.  Customers have exhibited a trend towards more
sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics
supply chain by embracing strategies such as just-in-time inventory management.  The Company believes that this trend has
resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological
capacity and consistent global coverage. 
Accordingly, sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities
and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting
and retaining customers.

Developing these systems and
a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services
provided to customers.  Smaller and
middle-tier competitors, in general, do not have the resources available to
develop customized systems and a worldwide network.  As a result, there is a significant amount of
consolidation currently taking place in the industry.  Management expects that this trend toward
consolidation will continue for the short- to medium-term.

The nature of the Company’s
worldwide operations necessitates the Company dealing with a multitude of
currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  This
results in the Company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international
currency markets and governmental interference.  Some of the countries where the Company maintains
offices and/or agency relationships have strict currency control regulations
which influence the Company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure.  The Company tries to compensate for these
exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices
or agents.  The Company enters into
foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are
regulatory or commercial limitations on the Company’s ability to move money
freely around the world or the short-term financial outlook in any country is
such that hedging is the most time-sensitive way to avoid short-term exchange
losses.  Any such hedging activity during
2006, 2005 and 2004 was insignificant.  Net
foreign currency losses realized in 2006 were $321.  Net foreign currency gains realized in 2005
and 2004 were $862 and $86, respectively. 
The Company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at
December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Sources of Growth

During 2006, the Company
opened 2 full-service offices (•) and 6 satellite offices (+), as follows:

Omaha, Nebraska+

Xi’an, People’s Republic of China (PRC) converted from
a satellite office to a full-service office during 2006.

Acquisitions -
Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge
for many of the Company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of
significant “goodwill,” the value of which can be realized in large measure
only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business.  As a result, the Company has pursued a
strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic
acquisitions, where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the “goodwill”
recorded in the transaction.


Internal Growth -
Management believes that a comparison of “same store” growth is critical in the
evaluation of the quality and extent of the Company’s internally generated
growth.  This “same store” analysis
isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in
the Company’s operating results for at least one full year.  The table below presents “same store”
comparisons on a year-over-year basis for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s principal
source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities.  Net cash provided by operating activities for
the year ended December 31, 2006 was $333 million, as compared with $267
million for 2005.  This $66 million
increase is principally due to increased net earnings.  The increase in taxes payable, net of prepaid
taxes, is the result of higher tax liabilities on higher earnings and lower relative
amounts of estimated tax payments.

The Company’s business is
subject to seasonal fluctuations.  Cash
flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality.  Historically, the first quarter shows an
excess of customer collections over customer billings.  This results in positive cash flow.  The increased activity associated with peak
season (typically commencing late second or early third quarter) causes an
excess of customer billings over customer collections.  This cyclical growth in customer receivables
consumes available cash.

As a customs broker, the
Company makes significant 5-10 business day cash advances for certain of its
customers’ obligations such as the payment of duties to the Customs and Border
Protection of the Department of Homeland Security.  These advances are made as an accommodation
for a select group of credit-worthy customers. 
Cash advances are a “pass through” and are not recorded as a component
of revenue and expense.  The billings of
such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts
receivable to the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to
governmental customs authorities.  As a
result of these “pass through” billings, the conventional Days Sales
Outstanding or DSO calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency.

Cash used in investing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $143 million, as
compared with $91 million during the same period of 2005.  The largest use of cash in investing
activities is cash paid for capital expenditures.  As a non-asset based provider of integrated
logistics services, the Company does not own any physical means of
transportation (i.e., airplanes, ships, trucks, etc.).  However, the Company does have need, on
occasion, to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of
customers’ freight.  The Company
routinely invests in technology, office furniture and equipment and leasehold
improvements.  For the year ended
December 31, 2006, the Company made capital expenditures of $141 million
as compared with $91 million for the same period in 2005.  Capital expenditures in 2006 included $67
million for the acquisition of real estate and office/warehouse facilities in
Miami, Florida.  In addition, the Company
had real estate development expenditures of $22 million related to projects in
Seattle, Washington and Houston, Texas.  Other
capital expenditures in 2006 and 2005 related primarily to investments in
technology, office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements.
 The Company currently expects to spend approximately $43 million for
normal capital expenditures in 2007.  In
addition to property and equipment, normal capital expenditures include
leasehold improvements, warehouse equipment, computer hardware and furniture
and fixtures.  Total capital expenditures
in 2007 are currently estimated to be $106 million.  This includes normal capital expenditures as
noted above, plus additional real estate acquisitions and development.  The Company expects to finance capital
expenditures in 2007 with cash.

Cash used in financing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $160 million as
compared with $107 million for the same period in 2005.  The Company uses the proceeds from stock
option exercises to repurchase the Company’s stock on the open market.  In 2006, the Company continued its policy of
repurchasing stock to prevent growth in issued and outstanding shares as a
result of stock option exercises.  The
increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2006 compared with the same period in 2005 is primarily the
result of this policy.  During 2006 and 2005 the net use of cash in
financing activities included the payment of dividends of $.22 per share and
$.15 per share, respectively.

At December 31,
2006, working capital was $633 million, including cash and short-term
investments of $512 million. The Company had no long-term debt at
December 31, 2006.

The Company maintains
international and domestic unsecured bank lines of credit.  At December 31, 2006, the United States
facility totaled $50 million and the international bank lines of credit,
excluding the U.K. bank facility, totaled $18 million.  In addition, the Company maintains a bank
facility with its U.K. bank for $14 million which is available for short-term
borrowings and issuances of standby letters of credit.  At December 31, 2006, the Company had no
amounts outstanding on these lines of credit, but was contingently liable for
$63 million from standby letters of credit and guarantees related to these
lines of credit and other obligations.


The guarantees relate to
obligations of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the
ordinary course of business by direct carriers, primarily airlines, and for duty
and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs
and value-added-tax (VAT) taxation.  The
total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental
excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective
foreign subsidiaries, and there would be no need to record additional expense
in the unlikely event the parent company were to be required to perform.

At December 31,
2006, the Company’s contractual obligations and other commitments are as

The Company enters into short-term agreements with
asset-based providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis.  The pricing of these obligations varies to
some degree with market conditions.  The
Company only enters into agreements that management believes the Company can
fulfill with relative ease.  Historically,
the Company has not paid for guaranteed space that it has not used.  Management believes, in line with historical
experience, committed purchase obligations outstanding as of December 31,
2006, will be fulfilled during 2007 in the Company’s ordinary course of business.

The Company has a Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase
Plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises.  As of December 31, 2006, the Company had
repurchased and retired 15,407,473 shares of common stock at an average price
of $13.24 per share over the period from 1994 through 2006.  During 2006, 1,105,773 shares were
repurchased at an average price of $44.20 per share.

The Company has a
Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan under which Management is allowed to
repurchase such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding
stock to 200,000,000 shares of common stock. 
As of December 31, 2006, the Company had repurchased and retired
9,752,196 shares of common stock at an average price of $26.43 per share over
the period from 2001 through 2006.  During
2006, 2,825,042 shares were repurchased at an average price of $44.92.  These discretionary repurchases were made to
keep the number of issued and outstanding shares from growing as a result of
stock option exercises.

Management believes that
the Company’s current cash position, bank financing arrangements, and operating
cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements
for the foreseeable future, including meeting any contingent liabilities
related to standby letters of credit and other obligations.

In some cases, the
Company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to
foreign exchange controls.  At
December 31, 2006, cash and cash equivalent balances of $345 million were
held by the Company’s non-United States subsidiaries, of which $46 million was
held in banks in the United States.

Impact of Inflation

To date, the Company’s
business has not been adversely affected by inflation.  Direct carrier rate increases could occur
over the short- to medium-term period.  Due
to the high degree of competition in the market place, these rate increases can
lead to an erosion in the Company’s margins. 
As the Company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive
property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest
rate-sensitive indebtedness, the Company currently has limited direct exposure
to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates.


Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

As of December 31,
2006, the Company did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as
defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

ITEM 7A —
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE

DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to
market risks in the ordinary course of its business.  These risks are primarily related to foreign
exchange risk and changes in short-term interest rates.   The potential
impact of the Company’s exposure to these risks is presented below:

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company conducts
business in many different countries and currencies.  The Company’s business often results in
revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where
the expenses related to the service are incurred.  In the ordinary course of business, the
Company creates numerous intercompany transactions.  This brings a market risk to the Company’s
earnings.

Foreign exchange rate
sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the Company’s
earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the U.S. dollar,
the Company’s reporting currency, relative to the other currencies in which the
Company transacts business.  All other
things being equal, an average 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar, throughout the
year ended December 31, 2006, would have had the effect of raising
operating income approximately $22 million. 
An average 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar, for the same period,
would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately $18 million.  This analysis does not take into account
changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation.  For example, a weakening in the U.S. dollar
would be expected to increase exports from the United States and depress
imports into the United States over some relevant period of time, but the exact
effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions.

As of December 31,
2006, the Company had approximately $2 million of net unsettled intercompany
transactions.  The Company currently does
not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and
only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations
where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the Company’s ability to
move money freely.  Any such hedging
activity throughout the year ended December 31, 2006, was insignificant.  The Company had no foreign currency
derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2006 and 2005.  The Company instead follows a policy of
accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk
relative to intercompany billings.  The
majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany
billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90
days.

Interest Rate Risk

At
December 31, 2006, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and
short-term investments of $512 million, of which $1 million was invested at
various short-term market interest rates. 
There were no short-term borrowings at December 31, 2006.  A hypothetical change in the interest rate of
10% would not have a significant impact on the Company’s earnings.

In management’s opinion,
there has been no material change in the Company’s market risk exposure between
2005 and 2006.

ITEM 9A
— CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Controls and Procedures

The Company carried out
an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure
controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of
the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Changes
in Internal Controls

There
were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

Management
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management
of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15(f).  The Company’s system of internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s
management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of our financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the


Company;
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

A
system of internal control can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance,
that the objectives of the control system are met.  Our management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted an
assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in “Internal Control —
Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Based
on this assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31,
2006, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

KPMG
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, which is included herein at F-2.

TO SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION FOR THE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005, AND 2004

Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Expeditors
International of Washington, Inc.:

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Expeditors
International of Washington, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and
2005, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity
and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2006. In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement
schedule II. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Expeditors
International of Washington, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and
2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 1, the Company changed its accounting policy for share-based
payments to employees as required by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”, effective as of
January 1, 2006.  The Company elected to
use the modified retrospective transition method, which provides that the
financial statements of prior periods are adjusted to reflect the fair value
method of expensing share-based compensation for all awards granted on or after
January 1, 1995.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Expeditors International
of Washington, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 1, 2007 expressed an unqualified
opinion on management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal
control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Expeditors
International of Washington, Inc.:

We have
audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying

Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

appearing under Item 9A, that Expeditors International of
Washington, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, management’s assessment that Expeditors International of Washington,
Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
criteria established in Internal Control— Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
Also, in our opinion, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Expeditors
International of Washington, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006 and our report
dated March 1, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.            Basis
of Presentation

Expeditors
International of Washington, Inc. (“the Company”) is a global logistics
company operating through a worldwide network of offices, international service
centers and exclusive or non-exclusive agents. The Company’s customers include
retailing and wholesaling, electronics, and manufacturing companies around the
world.  The Company grants credit upon approval to customers.

International
trade is influenced by many factors, including economic and political
conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange rates, and United
States and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs, trade restrictions,
foreign investments and taxation.  Periodically, governments consider a
variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions.  The Company
cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals may be adopted, nor can the
Company predict the effects adoption of any such proposal will have on the
Company’s business.  Doing business in foreign locations also subjects the
Company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by
domestic enterprises.  In addition to being affected by governmental
policies concerning international trade, the Company’s business may also be
affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or
policies in the nations in which it does business.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries stated in U.S. dollars, the Company’s reporting currency.  In
addition, the consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of
operating entities where the Company maintains a parent-subsidiary relationship
through unilateral control over assets and operations together with
responsibility for payment of all liabilities, notwithstanding a lack of
technical majority ownership of the subsidiary common stock.

All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

All
dollar amounts in the notes are presented in thousands except for share data.

B.            Cash
Equivalents

All
highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of
purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

C.            Short-term
Investments

Short-term
investments are designated as available-for-sale and cost approximates market
at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

D.            Accounts
Receivable

The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is reviewed at
least monthly for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its
customers to make required payments for services.  Additional allowances
may be necessary in the future if the ability of its customers to pay
deteriorates.

E.             Long-Lived
Assets, Depreciation and Amortization

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated or amortized on the
straight-line method over the shorter of the assets’ estimated useful lives or
lease terms. Useful lives for major categories of property and equipment are as
follows:

Buildings

28 to 40 years

Furniture,
  fixtures, equipment and purchased software

3 to 5 years

Vehicles

3 to 5 years

Expenditures
for maintenance, repairs, and renewals of minor items are charged to earnings
as incurred.  Major renewals and improvements are capitalized.  Upon
disposition, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in income for the period.

Effective
January 1, 2002, the Company ceased to amortize goodwill.  Goodwill
is recorded net of accumulated amortization of $765 at December 31, 2006
and 2005.  For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
Company performed the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter
and determined that no impairment had occurred.

F-7

Other
intangibles consist principally of payments made to purchase customer lists of
agents in countries where the Company established its own presence by opening
offices.  Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated
useful lives for periods up to 15 years and are reviewed for impairment if an
event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred.

Balances
as of December 31 are as follows:

F.             Revenues
and Revenue Recognition

The
Company derives its revenues from three principal sources: 1) airfreight, 2)
ocean freight, and 3) customs brokerage and other services.  These are the
revenue categories presented in the financial statements.

As a
non-asset based carrier, the Company does not own transportation assets. 
Rather, the Company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight
revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct (asset-based)
carriers and reselling those services to its customers.   The
difference between the rate billed to customers (the sell rate), and the rate
paid to the carrier (the buy rate) is termed “net revenue” or “yield”.  By
consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying
power, the Company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct
carriers, while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would
otherwise be able to negotiate themselves.

Airfreight
revenues include the charges to the Company for carrying the shipments when the
Company acts as a freight consolidator.  Ocean freight revenues include
the charges to the Company for carrying the shipments when the Company acts as
a Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC).  In each case the Company
is acting as an indirect carrier.  When acting as an indirect carrier, the
Company will issue a House Airway Bill (HAWB) or a House Ocean Bill of Lading
(HOBL) to customers as the contract of carriage.  In turn, when the
freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier, the Company receives a
contract of carriage known as a Master Airway Bill for airfreight shipments and
a Master Ocean Bill of Lading for ocean shipments.  At this point, the
risk of loss passes to the carrier, however, in order to claim for any such
loss, the customer is first obligated to pay the freight charges.

Based
upon the terms in the contract of carriage, revenues related to shipments where
the Company issues an HAWB or an HOBL are recognized at the time the freight is
tendered to the direct carrier at origin.  Costs related to the shipments
are also recognized at this same time.

Revenues
realized in other capacities, for instance, when the Company acts as an agent
for the shipper, and does not issue an HAWB or an HOBL, include only the
commissions and fees earned for the services performed.  These revenues
are recognized upon completion of the services.

Customs
brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination, such
as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required
documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes
on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by
governmental agencies, and arranging for delivery.   This is a
complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and
regulations in the multitude of countries in which the Company has
offices.  Revenues related to customs brokerage and other services are
recognized upon completion of the services.

Arranging
international shipments is a complex task.  Each actual movement can
require multiple services.  In some instances, the Company is asked to
perform only one of these services.  However, in most instances, the
Company may perform multiple services.  These services include destination
breakbulk services and value added ancillary services such as local
transportation, export customs formalities, distribution services and logistics
management.  Each of these services has an associated fee which is
recognized as revenue upon completion of the service.

Typically,
the fees for each of these services are quoted as separate components, however,
customers on occasion will request an all-inclusive rate for a set of services
known in the industry as “door-to-door service.”  This means that the
customer is billed a single rate for all services from pickup at origin to
delivery at destination.  In these instances, the revenue for origin and
destination services, as well as revenue that will be characterized as freight
charges, is allocated to branches as set by preexisting Company policy perhaps

F-8

supplemented
by customer specific negotiations between the offices involved.  Each of
the Company’s branches are separate profit centers and the primary compensation
for the branch management group comes in the form of incentive-based
compensation calculated directly from the operating income of that
branch.  This compensation structure ensures that the allocation of
revenue and expense among components of services, when provided under an
all-inclusive rate, are done in an objective manner on a fair value basis in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables.”

G.            Income
Taxes

Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method of
accounting.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases, the tax effect of loss carryforwards and tax credit
carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

H.            Net
Earnings per Common Share

Diluted
earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding.  Dilutive
potential common shares represent outstanding stock options and stock purchase
rights.  Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding without taking into consideration dilutive
potential common shares outstanding.

I.              Stock
Option Plans

Prior to January 1, 2006,
the Company applied APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option and
its employee stock purchase rights plans. 
Accordingly, no compensation cost had been recognized for its fixed
stock option or employee stock purchase rights plans.

Effective January 1,
2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No.
123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123R) using the modified
retrospective transition method.  Under
the modified retrospective method, prior periods may be restated either as of
the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented.  The Company has elected to restate all
periods presented to include compensation expense for all unvested stock
options and share awards.  Accordingly,
salaries and related costs for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
have been increased to include compensation expense for the fair value of stock
options and stock purchase rights on a straight line basis over the period they
become vested.  See Note 5D for further
discussion of the impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R on the consolidated
balance sheets, the consolidated results of operations, diluted earnings per
share and consolidated statements of cash flows.

F-9

J              Foreign
Currency

Foreign currency amounts attributable to foreign
operations have been translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates
for assets and liabilities, historical rates for equity, and weighted average
rates for revenues and expenses.  Unrealized gains or losses arising from
fluctuations in the year-end exchange rates are generally recorded as
components of other comprehensive income as adjustments from foreign currency
translation.  Currency fluctuations are a normal operating factor in the
conduct of the Company’s business and exchange transaction gains and losses are
generally included in freight consolidation expenses.

The
Company follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to
manage its foreign exchange exposure.  Accordingly, the Company enters
into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where
there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the Company’s ability to move
money freely around the world.  Such hedging activity during 2006, 2005,
and 2004 was insignificant.  Net foreign currency losses realized in 2006
were $321.  Net foreign currency gains
realized in 2005 and 2004 were $862 and $86, respectively.  The Company
had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2006 and
2005.

K             Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive
income consists of net earnings and other gains and losses affecting
shareholders’ equity that, under generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States, are excluded from net earnings.  For the Company, these
consist of foreign currency translation gains and losses and unrealized gains
and losses on securities, net of related income tax effects.

Accumulated
other comprehensive income consists of the following:

L              Segment
Reporting

The
Company is organized functionally in geographic operating segments. 
Accordingly, management focuses its attention on revenues, net revenues,
operating income, identifiable assets, capital expenditures, depreciation and
amortization and equity generated in

each
of these geographical areas when evaluating effectiveness of geographic
management.  The Company charges its subsidiaries and affiliates for
services rendered in the United States on a cost recovery basis. 
Transactions among the Company’s various offices are conducted using the same
arms-length pricing methodologies the Company uses when its offices transact
business with independent agents.

M.           Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

N.            Reclassifications

Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2006
presentation.

O.            Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB
ratified the EITF Issue 06-3, “How Taxes Collected From Customers and Remitted
to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement,” (EITF
06-3). The scope of EITF 06-3 includes any tax assessed by a governmental
authority that is both imposed on and concurrent with a specific
revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer, including but
not limited to sales and value-added taxes. 
In EITF 06-3 a consensus was reached that entities may adopt a policy of
presenting these taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis.
If these taxes are significant, an entity should disclose its policy of
presenting taxes and the amount of taxes if reflected on a gross basis in the
income statement. EITF 06-3 is effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is required to and plans
to adopt EITF 06-3 in the first quarter of 2007.  The Company presents revenues net of sales
and value-added taxes in its consolidated statement of earnings and does not
anticipate changing its policy as a result of the adoption of EITF 06-3.

F-10

In June 2006, the FASB
issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”, (FIN 48).  FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the Company’s financial statements in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS 109).  The interpretation establishes guidelines for
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.  FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is required to and plans to
adopt the provisions of FIN 48 beginning in the first quarter of 2007.  The Company does not expect the adoption of
FIN 48 to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
condition or results of operations.

On September 13,
2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB 108), “Considering the Effects of Prior
Year Misstatements when Qualifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements,” which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the
effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements
for the purpose of a materiality assessment.  The Company is required to and has adopted SAB
108 for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2006.  The adoption of SAB 108 had no impact on the
Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157).  SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles,
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies
under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements,
the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that
fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, this Statement
does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is required to
and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS 157 beginning in the first quarter of
2008.  The Company is currently assessing
the impact of the adoption of SFAS 157.

In February 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities” (SFAS 159).  Under
the provisions of SFAS 159, Companies may choose to account for eligible financial
instruments, warranties and insurance contracts at fair value on a
contract-by-contract basis.  Changes in
fair value will be recognized in earnings each reporting period.  SFAS 159 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. 
The Company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS 159
beginning in the first quarter of 2008. 
The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of SFAS
159.

NOTE 2.

OTHER ASSETS

The
Company regularly evaluates the recoverability of certain other assets. 
During 2004, the Company determined that an impairment had occurred and
accordingly, a $2,000 loss was recorded as an operating expense.  No
impairment occurred in 2006 or 2005.

NOTE 3.

CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

The
Company has a $50,000 United States bank line of credit extending through
July 1, 2007.  Borrowings under the line bear interest at LIBOR +
..75% (6.07% at December 31, 2006) and are unsecured.  As of
December 31, 2006, the entire $50,000 was available and the Company had no
borrowings under this line.

The
majority of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries maintain bank lines of credit
for short-term working capital purposes.  These credit lines are supported
by standby letters of credit issued by a United States bank, or guarantees
issued by the Company to the foreign banks issuing the credit line.  Lines
of credit totaling $19,516 and $12,850 at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, bear interest at rates up to 4% over the foreign banks’
equivalent prime rates.  At December 31, 2006, the Company had no
amounts outstanding under these lines and was contingently liable for
approximately $62,608 under outstanding standby letters of credit and guarantees
related to these lines of credit and other obligations.

The
guarantees relate to obligations of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries for
credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers,
primarily airlines, and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental
entities responsible for customs and value-added-tax (VAT) taxation.  The
total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental
excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective
foreign subsidiaries, and there would be no need to record additional expense
in the unlikely event the parent company were to be required to perform.

At
December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive
covenants of these credit lines and the associated credit facilities, including
maintenance of certain minimum asset, working capital and equity balances and
ratios.

NOTE 5.                 SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

A.            Stock Repurchase Plans

The Company has a
Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan under which management is authorized to
repurchase up to 20,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock in the open
market with the proceeds received from the exercise of Employee and Director
Stock Options.  As of December 31, 2006,
the Company had repurchased and retired 15,407,473 shares of common stock at an
average price of $13.24 per share over the period from 1994 through 2006.

In November 2001, the Board of Directors
expanded the Company’s Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to allow for the
repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and
outstanding stock to 200,000,000 shares of common stock.  As of December 31, 2006, the Company had
repurchased and retired 9,752,196 shares of common stock at an average price of
$26.43 per share over the period from 2001 through 2006.

B.            Stock Option Plans

At December 31,
2006, the Company has two stock option plans (the “1985 Plan” and the “2006
Plan”) for employees under which the Board of Directors may grant officers and
key employees options to purchase common stock at prices equal to or greater
than market value on the date of grant. 
On May 3, 2006, the shareholders approved the Company’s 2006 Plan, which
made available a total of 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock for
purchase upon exercise of options granted under the 2006 Plan.  The 1997 Option Plan was cancelled upon the
approval of the 2005 Plan. The 1985 Plan provides for non-qualified
grants.  The 2006 Plan provides for
qualified and non-qualified grants. Under the 1985, 2005 and 2006 Plans,
outstanding options generally vest and become exercisable over periods up to
five years from the date of grant and expire no more than 10 years from the
date of grant. Grants under the 2006 Plan are limited to not more than 100,000
shares per person.  No additional shares
can be granted under the 2006 Plan after April 30, 2007.

The Company also has a
stock option plan (“Directors’ Plan”) under which non-employee directors
elected at each annual meeting are granted non-qualified options to purchase
32,000 shares of common stock at prices equal to the market value on the date
of grant on the first business day of the month following the meeting.  On May 3, 2006, the Directors’ Plan was
amended by shareholder vote to require a one year vesting period.  Previously, options granted under the
Directors’ Plan vested immediately.

Upon the exercise
of non-qualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive
stock options, the Company derives a tax deduction measured by the excess of
the market value over the option price at the date of disqualifying
disposition.  The portion of the benefit
from the deduction which equals the estimated fair value of the options
(previously recognized as compensation expense) is recorded as a credit to the
deferred tax asset for non-qualified stock options and is recorded as a credit
to current tax expense for any disqualified dispositions of incentive stock
options.  All of the tax benefit received
upon option exercise for the tax deduction in excess of the estimated fair
value of the options is credited to additional paid-in capital.

C.            Stock Purchase Plan

In May 2002, the
shareholders approved the Company’s 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2002
Plan”), which became effective August 1, 2002 upon the expiration of the 1988
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“1988 Plan”) on July 31, 2002.  The Company’s 2002 Plan provides for
4,305,452 shares of the Company’s common stock, including 305,452 remaining
shares transferred from the 1988 Plan, to be reserved for issuance upon
exercise of purchase rights granted to employees who elect to participate
through regular payroll deductions beginning August 1 of each year.  The purchase rights are exercisable on July
31 of the following year at a price equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair
market value of the Company’s stock on July 31 or (2) 85% of the fair market
value of the Company’s stock on the preceding August 1.  At December 31, 2006, an aggregate of
3,127,578 shares had been issued under the 2002 Plan and $11,399 had been
withheld in connection with the plan year ending July 31, 2007.

D.            Adoption of SFAS
123R

As described in
Note 1, effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, requiring the
recording of compensation expense based on an estimate of the fair value of
options awarded under its fixed stock option or employee stock purchase rights
plans.  The Company elected to utilize
the modified retrospective method of transitioning to SFAS 123R and has
restated all prior periods to recognize the required stock compensation
expense.

In applying the
modified retrospective method, the Company has recorded compensation expense as
previously stated in the Company’s pro forma SFAS 123 disclosures in the
footnotes to its prior period financial statements.  The fair value of options used to determine
this compensation expense was originally determined using the Black-Scholes
model and no changes have been made to the compensation expense as originally
stated in the pro forma disclosures.  The
original measurements and assumptions previously disclosed in the footnotes to
the Company’s financial statement included in its annual Form 10-K filings and,
in more recent years, in its Form 10-Q filings, also have not been
changed.  In the process of recording the
associated deferred tax assets related to this compensation expense, as required
by SFAS 123R, the Company made its computations on a “grant by grant”
basis.  As a result of this exercise, the
Company determined that recording deferred tax assets based on the disclosed
proforma amounts would have been incorrect under the provisions of SFAS No.
109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. 
Accordingly, in restating the results of prior years, management has
elected to record adjustments to income tax expense and to properly record
deferred tax assets.

Prior to the
adoption of SFAS 123R, in the statement of cash flows, the tax benefits
received by the Company from the exercise of certain employee stock options
were added back to net earnings in determining net cash provided by operating
activities.  SFAS 123R requires a
different presentation for that portion of the tax benefit received upon option
exercise which exceeds the tax benefit that would have been recorded based on
the estimated fair value of the options previously recognized as compensation
expense.  Accordingly, the Company has
reclassified this excess tax benefit from cash provided by operating activities
to cash provided by financing activities in the statement of cash flows.

The following
tables summarize the adjustments to certain line items in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting SFAS 123R for all
periods presented. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
with the 2006 presentation. Third party outsourced labor costs were
reclassified in the consolidated statement of earnings as a result of the
growth in the Company’s distribution services business. Net distributions to
minority interests of immaterial amounts were reclassified to net cash used in
financing activities.

The Company’s expected volatility assumptions are
based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The expected life
assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and
employee post-vesting termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate for the
expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect
at the time of grant for U.S. Treasury bonds having the same term as the
expected life of the option, i.e. a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an
option with a ten year expected life. The expected dividend yield is based on
the Company’s historical experience. The forfeiture rate used to calculate
compensation expense is primarily based on historical pre-vesting employee
forfeiture patterns.

The total
intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004 was approximately $111 million, $76 million and $65 million, respectively.
The estimated fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $29 million, $28 million and $23 million,
respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, the total unrecognized compensation cost
related to unvested stock options is $103 million and the weighted average
period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is 1.91 years.

Total stock compensation expense and the total related tax benefit
recognized for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:

NOTE 6.                 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

The Company’s financial
instruments, other than cash, consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term
investments, accounts receivable, short-term debt, accounts payable and accrued
expenses.  The fair values of these
financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts based upon market
interest rates or their short-term nature.

NOTE 7.                 COMMITMENTS

A.            Leases

The Company occupies

Unconditional

Purchase Obligations

The Company enters into short-term agreements with
asset-based providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis.  The pricing of these obligations varies to
some degree with market conditions.  The
Company only enters into agreements that management believes the Company can
fulfill with relative ease. 
Historically, the Company has not paid for guaranteed space that it has
not used.  Management believes, in line
with historical experience, committed purchase obligations outstanding as of

Net revenues are
determined by deducting freight consolidation costs from total revenues.  The sum of quarterly per share data may not
equal the per share total reported for the year.

All share and per share
information have been adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split effected in
June 2006.

Certain amounts for 2005
have been restated as required by the modified retrospective method in
connection with the implementation of SFAS 123R.  In preparing the second quarter 2005 SFAS
123R restatements during the second quarter of 2006, an insignificant
difference of $177 was noted which should have been included for the first
quarter of 2005.  This insignificant
amount was included in the year-to-date 2005 restated amounts reported in the
second quarter of 2006.  The first
quarter of 2005 results presented in the above schedule are the corrected
restated amounts and are not the amounts originally reported in the Form 10-Q
filed for the first quarter 2006.

The fourth quarter 2005
results include a $21,680 tax benefit ($.10 per share increase in net earnings)
as a result of a one time election under IRC 965.
