Forward-Looking Statements

In accordance with the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is making readers aware
that forward-looking statements, because they relate to future events, are by their very nature subject to many important risk factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. For
additional information about forward-looking statements and for an identification of risk factors and their potential significance, see “Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements Under Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995; Certain
Cautionary Statements” immediately preceding Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this report.

PART I

ITEM 1 — BUSINESS

Expeditors International of Washington,
Inc. is engaged in the business of providing global logistics services. The Company offers its customers a seamless international network supporting the movement and strategic positioning of goods. The Company’s services include the
consolidation or forwarding of air and ocean freight. In each United States office, and in many overseas offices, the Company acts as a customs broker. The Company also provides additional services including distribution management, vendor
consolidation, cargo insurance, purchase order management and customized logistics information. The Company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business and does not own aircraft or steamships.

Beginning in 1981, the Company’s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from Asia to the United
States and related customs brokerage and other services. In the mid-1980’s, the Company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight, ocean freight and distribution services. Today the Company offers a complete range
of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers, both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location. As opportunities for profitable growth arise, the Company plans to create new offices. While the Company has
historically expanded through organic growth, the Company has also been open to growth through acquisition of, or establishing joint ventures with, existing agents or others within the industry.

The Company, including its majority-owned subsidiaries, operates full service offices (•) in the cities
identified below. Full service offices have also been established in locations where the Company maintains unilateral control over assets and operations and where the existence of the parent-subsidiary relationship is maintained by means other than
record ownership of voting stock (#). In other cities, the Company contracts with independent agents to provide required services and has established approximately 48 such relationships world-wide. Locations where Company employees perform sales and
customer service functions are identified below as international service centers (*). Wholly-owned locations operating under the supervision and control of another full service office are identified as satellite offices (+). In each case, the
opening date for the full service office, international service center or satellite office is set forth in parenthesis.

Airfreight Services

Airfreight services accounted for approximately 38, 35 and 36 percent of the Company’s 2010, 2009 and 2008 consolidated
revenues net of freight consolidation expenses (“net revenues”), respectively. When performing airfreight services, the Company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the
shipment. When acting as a freight consolidator, the Company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines. When moving
shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation, the Company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment. Whether acting as a consolidator or agent, the
Company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing, familiarity with local business practices, knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures, the ability to arrange for ancillary services, and assistance with space availability
in periods of peak demand.

In its airfreight forwarding operations, the Company procures shipments from
its customers, determines the routing, consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point, and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point. At the distribution point, the Company or its agent arranges
for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations.

The Company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 3,900 pounds and a typical
consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers. Because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation, air shipments are generally characterized by a high value-to-weight ratio, the need for rapid
delivery, or both.

The Company typically delivers shipments from a Company warehouse at the origin to
the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets. Shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within forty-eight hours after such delivery. During peak shipment periods, cargo space available
from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur. When these conditions exist, the Company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand.

The Company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in cost-effective
combinations. Typically, as the weight or volume of a shipment increases, the cost per pound/kilo or cubic inch/centimeter charged by the Company decreases. The rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the
weight or volume of the shipment increases. As a result, by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment, the Company is able to obtain a lower rate per pound/kilo or cubic inch/centimeter than that which it
charges to its customers for the individual shipment, while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment.

The Company’s airfreight forwarding net revenues from a consolidated shipment include the differential between
the rate charged to the Company by an airline and the rate which the Company charges to its customers, commissions paid to the Company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services. Such ancillary services provided by the
Company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation, packing, crating and insurance services, negotiation of letters of credit, and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws. When the Company acts as an agent
for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment, its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer.

The Company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots
and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments. Breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipments.

The Company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so. Management believes that the ownership of
aircraft would subject the Company to undue business risks, including large capital outlays, increased fixed operating expenses, problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines. Because the Company relies on commercial
airlines to transport its shipments, changes in carrier financial stability, policies and practices such as pricing, payment terms, scheduling, capacity and frequency of service may affect its business.

4. |


The commercial airline industry as a whole incurred substantial
operating losses in 2009. While their operations improved in 2010, many airlines are highly leveraged with debt. Carriers continue to merge and consolidate operations and reduce available capacity to improve financial results. Some airlines have
significantly reduced their reliance on cargo-only aircraft to service their airfreight customers. The reduction in capacity allows asset-based carriers to raise rates in the face of declining or stable demand. When fewer planes are flying, the
Company has fewer shipping options from which to craft service offerings to meet customers’ needs. The combination of reduced capacity, higher rates and more infrequent flights could challenge the Company’s ability to maintain historical
unitary profitability.

Ocean Freight and Ocean Services

Ocean freight services accounted for approximately 23, 24, and 25 percent of the Company’s 2010, 2009 and 2008 consolidated
net revenues, respectively. The Company operates Expeditors International Ocean (“EIO”), an Ocean Transportation Intermediary, sometimes referred to as a Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (“NVOCC”) specializing in ocean
freight consolidation in most major trade lanes in the world. As an NVOCC, EIO contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed
rate. EIO handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers. EIO also solicits Less-than Container Load (“LCL”)
freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines. The Company’s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are also derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees
charged to customers for ancillary services which the Company may provide, such as preparing documentation, procuring insurance, arranging for packing and crating services, and providing consultation. The Company does not own vessels and
generally does not physically handle the cargo.

Ocean carriers incurred substantial operating losses in
2009. Operations improved in 2010, but many carriers are highly leveraged with debt. Carriers continue to manage available capacity and modify sailing schedules to improve financial results. The combination of lower capacity, slower sailing
schedules and pricing volatility could impact the Company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability.

Order Management provides services which manage origin consolidation, supplier performance, carrier allocation and performance, container management, document management, destination management and PO/SKU
visibility through a web based application. Customers have the ability to monitor and report against real time status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery. Item quantities, required ship dates, commodity descriptions,
estimated vs. actual ex factory dates, container utilization, supplier performance and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web. Order Management is available for various modes of
transportation including ocean, air, truck and rail. Order Management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules. One basic
function of Order Management involves the taking of cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and “consolidating” these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space and minimize cost. Through origin
consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers. Data integrity is an increasingly critical function of Order Management. Efficient data management is a by-product of our
operational processes.

Customs Brokerage and Other Services

Customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 39, 41 and 39 percent of the Company’s 2010, 2009 and 2008
consolidated net revenues, respectively. As a customs broker, the Company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer,
arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies, and arranging for delivery. The Company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and

| 5.


product distribution, time definite transportation and inventory management. None of these other services are currently individually significant to the Company’s net revenues.

The Company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as
a freight forwarder. However, substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder. Conversely, shipments handled by the Company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker
selected by the customer.

The Company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and
truck between the United States, Canada and/or Mexico. The commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the Company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide
competitive service.

The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Expeditors Tradewin, L.L.C., responds
to customer driven requests for high-end customs consulting services. Fees for these non-transactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projects.

Marketing and Customers

The Company provides customer specific solutions and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from order inception through to order delivery. Although the domestic importer usually designates the
logistics company and the services that will be required, the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process. Therefore, the Company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas
suppliers.

The Company’s marketing efforts are focused on interacting with our customers’
supply chain, including logistics, transportation, customs, compliance and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers. The district manager of each office is responsible for marketing, sales coordination, and implementation in
the area in which he or she is located. All employees are responsible for customer service and retention.

The Company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics. Marketing and customer
service staffs are responsible for marketing the Company’s services directly to customers and prospects who may select or influence the selection of logistics service providers and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient
service. The Company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers, its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities, and the incentives it gives to
its managers have been important elements of its success.

The goods handled by the Company are
generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination. Shipments of computer components, electronic goods, medical equipment, sporting goods, machine parts, aviation parts and toys
comprise a significant percentage of the Company’s business. Typical import customers include retailers and distributors of consumer electronics, department store chains, clothing and shoe wholesalers, manufacturers and catalogue
stores. Historically, no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the Company’s net revenues.

Competition

The global logistics services industry is
intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. There are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry, but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement
of logistics services is more limited. Depending on the location of the shipper and the importer, the Company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities. Historically, the industry has experienced consolidations into
larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multi-service networks. However, regional and local competitors still maintain a strong market presence in certain areas.

6. |


The primary competitive factors in the global logistics services
industry continue to be price and quality of service, including reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of operations. The Company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of
others in the industry. Larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as just-in-time inventory management. Accordingly, timely and
accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers. This information integrated into customer service capabilities include customized Electronic Data Interchange,
(“EDI”), on-line freight tracing and tracking applications and customized on-line reporting. The customized EDI applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers’ systems and the Company’s
systems. Freight tracing and tracking applications provide customers with real time visibility to the location, transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit.

Management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers’
increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the Company. The Company devotes a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these
customer demands. Management believes that the Company’s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes.

Unlike many of its competitors, who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition, the Company operates the same
accounting and transportation computer software, running on a common hardware platform, in all of its full-service locations. Small and middle-tier competitors, in general, do not have the resources available to develop these customized
systems. Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the Company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill.” As a result, the Company has
pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions.

The
Company’s ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential, if not the most important, element of its ability to compete in the industry. To this end, the
Company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel. The Company believes that these incentive compensation programs, combined
with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts, provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have generally matched only through acquisition.

Currency and Other Risk Factors

The nature of the Company’s worldwide operations necessitate the Company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than
the U.S. dollar. This results in the Company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference. Many of the countries where the Company maintains offices and/or agency relationships
have strict currency control regulations which influence the Company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. The Company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices
or agents.

In addition, the Company’s ability to provide service to its customers is highly
dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines, steamship lines and governmental agencies. The Company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory. However,
changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities of asset-based carriers, space allotments available from carriers, governmental deregulation efforts, “modernization” of the regulations governing customs clearance, and/or
changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the Company’s business in unpredictable ways.

| 7.


Seasonality

Historically, the Company’s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly
basis. The first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest. This pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors including weather patterns,
national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces. In addition, this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the Company’s international
network and service offerings. The Company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors, nor can the Company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and, as a result, there can be no assurance that historical
patterns will continue in future periods.

Environmental

In the United States, the Company is subject to Federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment. Similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these
environmental laws, governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues, and the Company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business. The Company does not anticipate making any
material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years.

Employees

At January 31, 2011, the Company employed
approximately 12,880 people, 4,410 in the United States and 730 in the balance of North America, 620 in Latin America, 3,850 in Asia Pacific, 2,100 in Europe and Africa, and 1,170 in the Middle East. Approximately 1,730 of the Company’s
employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service, 7,550 in operations and 3,600 in finance and administration. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its
employees to be satisfactory.

In order to retain the services of highly qualified, experienced, and
motivated employees, the Company places considerable emphasis on its non-equity incentive compensation programs and stock option plans.

Regulation and Security

With respect to the
Company’s activities in the air transportation industry in the United States, it is subject to regulation by the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) of the Department of Homeland Security as an indirect air carrier. All
United States indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by TSA. The Company’s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective
countries of operation. The Company is licensed in each of its offices, or in the case of its newer offices, has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”). IATA
is a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members. The majority of the Company’s airfreight forwarding
business is conducted with airlines which are IATA members.

The Company is licensed as an Ocean
Transportation Intermediary (“OTI”) (sometimes referred to as NVOCC-

N

on-

V

essel

O

perating

C

ommon

C

arrier) by the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”). The FMC has established certain
qualifications for shipping agents, including certain surety bonding requirements. The FMC is also responsible for the economic regulation of OTI/NVOCC activity originating or terminating in the United States. To comply with these economic
regulations, vessel operators and NVOCCs, such as EIO, are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the United States. The FMC has the power to
enforce these regulations by assessing penalties.

The Company is licensed as a customs broker by
Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) of the Department of Homeland Security nationally and in each U.S. customs district in which it does business. All United States customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are
subject to periodic audits by CBP. In other jurisdictions in which the Company performs clearance services, the Company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority (where such license is required to perform these services). The
Company participates in various governmental supply chain security programs, such as the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT”) in the United States and additional security initiatives as they continue to be enacted by
different governments, such as Authorized Economic Operator (“AEO”).

The Company does not
believe that current United States and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations. In general, the Company conducts its business activities in each country through a majority-owned
subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country. However, the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the Company’s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a
wholly or majority United States-owned subsidiary. For example, foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding and/or
freight consolidation is restricted to local entities. When the Company encounters this sort of governmental restriction, it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the Company
the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation. This can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required
license. The war on terror and governments’ overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import and/or export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation

10. |


of cargo security regulations over the past several years. While these cargo regulations have already created a marked difference in the security arrangements required to move shipments around
the globe, regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future. As governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terror related incidents, the Company and its competitors in the transportation business
may be required to incorporate security procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past. The Company feels that increased security requirements may involve further investments in technology and
more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to potential customers, vendors and employees. The Company’s position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries
of the Company’s services.

Cargo Liability

When acting as an airfreight consolidator, the Company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged shipments. This
legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value (17 Special Drawing Rights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge), except if the loss or damage is
caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill. The airline which the Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the Company in the same manner and to the same extent. When acting
solely as the agent of the airline or shipper, the Company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline.

When acting as an ocean freight consolidator, the Company assumes a carrier’s liability for lost or damaged
shipments. This liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value ($500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge). The
steamship line which the Company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the Company in the same manner and to the same extent. In its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations, the Company does not assume
cargo liability.

When providing warehouse and distribution services, the Company limits its legal
liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or $0.50 per pound with a maximum of $50 per “lot” — which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track. Upon
payment of a surcharge for warehouse and distribution services, the Company will assume additional liability.

The Company maintains cargo legal liability insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable. The Company also maintains insurance coverage for
the property of others which is stored in Company warehouse facilities. This insurance coverage is provided by a Vermont U.S. based insurance entity wholly-owned by the Company. The coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance
company. The total risk retained by the Company in 2010 was approximately $4 million. In addition, the Company is licensed as an insurance broker through its subsidiary, Expeditors Cargo Insurance Brokers, Inc. and places insurance
coverage for other customers.

ITEM 2 — PROPERTIES

The Company owns the following properties:

*

Company directly owns 50% with Cargo Ventures, LLC, a private, non-affiliated real estate development company.

The Company leases and maintains 68 additional offices and satellite locations in the United States and 356 leased
locations throughout the world, each located close to an airport, ocean port, or on an important border crossing. The majority of these facilities contain warehouse facilities. Lease terms are either on a month-to-month basis or terminate
at various times through 2020. See Note 7 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for lease commitments. As an office matures, the Company will investigate the possibility of building or buying suitable facilities. The
Company believes that current leases can be extended and that suitable alternative facilities are available in the vicinity of each present facility should extensions be unavailable at the conclusion of current leases.

ITEM 3 — LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On October 10, 2007, the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a subpoena ordering the Company to produce certain
information and records relating to an investigation of alleged anti-competitive behavior amongst air cargo freight forwarders. The Company has retained the services of a law firm to assist in complying with the DOJ’s subpoena. As part of this
process, the Company has met with and continues to co-operate with the DOJ. The Company expects to incur additional costs during the course of this ongoing investigation, which could include fines and/or penalties if the DOJ concludes that the
Company has engaged in anti-competitive behavior and such fines and/or penalties could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and operating cash flows.

On January 3, 2008, the Company was named as a defendant, with seven other European and North American-based
global logistics providers, in a Federal antitrust class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court of the Eastern District of New York, Precision Associates, Inc. et al v. Panalpina World Transport, No. 08-CV0042. On
July 21, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding a number of new third party defendants and various claims which they assert to violate the Sherman Act. The plaintiffs’ amended complaint, which purports to be brought on
behalf of a class of customers (and has not yet been certified), asserts claims that the defendants engaged in price fixing regarding eight discrete surcharges in violation of the Sherman Act. The allegations concerning the Company relate to two of
these surcharges. The amended complaint seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief. The Company believes that these allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself. On August 13, 2009, the Company filed a motion to
dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs filed their opposition to the Company’s motion on January 30, 2010, to which the Company filed a reply, and the motion is currently pending before the Court.

On June 18, 2008, the European Commission (EC) issued a request for information to the
Company’s UK subsidiary, Expeditors International (UK) Ltd., requesting certain information relating to an ongoing investigation of freight forwarders. The Company replied to the request. On February 18, 2009, the EC issued another request
for information to the same subsidiary requesting certain additional information in connection with the EC’s ongoing investigation of freight forwarders. The Company replied to the request. On February 10, 2010, the Company and its Hong
Kong subsidiary, Expeditors Hong Kong Limited, received a Statement of Objections (SO) from the EC. The SO initiates a proceeding against the Company alleging anti-competitive behavior contrary to European Union rules on competition. Specific to the
Company, the allegations in the SO are limited to the period from August 2005 to June 2006 and only concern airfreight trade lanes between South China/Hong Kong and the European Economic Area. The Company filed a response to the allegations in the
SO on April 12, 2010 and participated in an oral hearing on July 6, 2010. On January 20, 2011, the EC issued another request for information to the Company and its Hong Kong subsidiary requesting certain additional information in
connection with its on-going investigation of freight forwarders. The Company replied to the request. The Company continues to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. The Company expects to incur additional costs during the course of this
ongoing proceeding, which could include administrative fines if the EC concludes that the Company has engaged in anti-competitive behavior and such fines could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations
and operating cash flows.

On August 17, 2010, the Company and its Brazilian subsidiary, Expeditors
Internacional do Brasil Ltda received an Administrative Proceeding (AP) from the Brazilian Ministry of Justice (MOJ). The AP initiates a proceeding against the Company and one of its employees, alleging possible anti-competitive behavior. The
Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. The Company expects to incur additional costs during the course of this proceeding, which could include administrative fines if the MOJ concludes that the Company has engaged in
anti-competitive behavior and such fines could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and operating cash flows.

The proceedings described above generally relate to investigations of freight forwarders or allegations of
anti-competitive behavior. The distractions caused by these proceedings and the legal and other costs associated with these proceedings have been significant. The Company has incurred approximately $1 million, less than $1 million, and approximately
$10 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in legal

| 17.


and associated costs on the above matters. Since the beginning of the proceedings in 2007, the Company has incurred approximately $15 million in legal and associated costs on the above matters.
At this time the Company is unable to estimate the range of loss or damages, if any, that might result as an outcome of any of these proceedings. The Company assumes, as should investors, that these challenges could continue for a significant period
of time and may require the investment of substantial additional management time and substantial financial resources. These government investigations and the related litigation matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings
could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include substantial monetary damages and, in matters in which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, an injunction or other order relating to business conduct. Were unfavorable final outcomes
to occur, the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations, and operating cash flows could be materially harmed.

The Company is involved in other claims and lawsuits which arise in the ordinary course of business, none of which currently, in management’s opinion, will have a significant effect on the Company’s
operations or financial position.

ITEM 5 — MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY
SECURITIES

The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices for the Company’s common stock as reported
by The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol EXPD.

There were 1,347 shareholders of record as of February 18, 2011. This figure does not include a
substantially greater number of beneficial holders of the Company’s common stock, whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers and other financial institutions.

The Board of Directors declared semi-annual dividends during the two most recent fiscal years paid as follows:

ISSUER PURCHASES OF
EQUITY SECURITIES

In November 1993, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a Non-Discretionary Stock
Repurchase Plan for the purpose of repurchasing the Company’s common stock in the open market with the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. On February 9, 2009, the Plan was amended to increase the authorization to
repurchase up to 40 million shares of the Company’s common stock. This authorization has no expiration date. This plan was disclosed in the Company’s report on Form 10-K filed March 31, 1995. In the fourth quarter of
2010, 755,736 shares of common stock were repurchased under the Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan.

| 19.


In November 2001, under a Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan,
the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 200 million shares of common stock. The maximum number of shares available for repurchase
under this plan will increase as the total number of outstanding shares increases. This authorization has no expiration date. This plan was announced on November 13, 2001. In the fourth quarter of 2010, 1,252,157 shares of common
stock were repurchased under the Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan. These discretionary repurchases were made to limit the growth in the number of issued and outstanding shares resulting from stock option exercises and the exercise of
employee stock purchase rights.

ITEM 7 — MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Executive Summary

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. is engaged in the business of global logistics management, including
international freight forwarding and consolidation, for both air and ocean freight. The Company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices, and in many of its international offices. The Company also provides additional services for
its customers including value-added distribution, purchase order management, vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions. The Company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business. The Company does not own or operate
aircraft or steamships.

International trade is influenced by many factors, including economic and
political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange rates, regulatory environments, cargo and other security concerns, laws and policies relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, foreign investments and
taxation. Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to regulations, current tariffs and trade restrictions and accords. The Company cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals may be adopted, nor can the Company predict
the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on the Company’s business. Doing business in foreign locations also subjects the Company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic
enterprises. In addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade, the Company’s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies, as well as
economic turbulence or security concerns in the nations in which it does business, such as the current events in the Middle East and the future impact that these events may have on international trade and oil prices. The global logistics services
industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. Consistent with current economic conditions, the Company’s pricing continues to be pressured by customers and service providers.

The Company derives its revenues from three principal sources: 1) airfreight services, 2) ocean freight and ocean
services, and 3) customs brokerage and other services. These are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements.

The Company is managed along three geographic areas of responsibility: Americas; Asia Pacific; and Europe, Africa, Near/Middle East and Indian Subcontinent (EMAIR). Each area is divided into sub-regions
which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility. The Company’s business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area. The nature of the
international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units. Because of this inter-relationship between operating units, it is very difficult to look at one geographic area and draw
meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the Company’s overall success on a stand-alone basis.

The Company’s operating units share revenue using the same arms-length pricing methodologies the Company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents. The Company charges its subsidiaries
and affiliates for services rendered in the United States on a cost recovery basis. The Company’s strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability. Individual success likely involves cooperation with other
operating units.

As a non-asset based carrier, the Company does not own transportation
assets. Rather, the Company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct (asset-based) carriers and reselling those services to its customers. The difference between
the rate billed to customers (the sell rate) and the rate paid to the carrier (the buy rate) is termed “net revenue” or “yield.” By consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power, the
Company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers, while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves. Buy rates continued to be challenging in 2010 as volumes
increased and carriers managed overall capacity. Consequently, price changes are absorbed by the Company during the short-term, pending negotiation with and acceptance by the Company’s customers. The combination of carriers managing capacity
and associated price volatility continues to challenge the Company’s ability to maintain historical unitary profitability.

22. |


Customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at
destination, such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections
by governmental agencies, and arranging for delivery. This is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the Company has offices.

The Company’s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships
with a variety of entities including airlines, ocean steamship lines, and governmental agencies. The significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and asset-based carriers involved in global trade has
gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism. As each carrier labors to comply with additional governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures, inherent conflicts emerge which can and do
affect global trade. A good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles. The Company considers its current working
relationships with these entities to be satisfactory. However, airline and ocean steamship line industries have incurred significant losses in recent years as a result of the global economic downturn and many carriers are highly leveraged with
debt. This situation has required the Company to be increasingly selective in which carriers to utilize. Further changes in the financial stability, operating capabilities and capacity of asset-based carriers, space allotments available from
carriers, governmental regulation or deregulation efforts, “modernization” of the regulations governing customs brokerage, and/or changes in governmental quota restrictions or trade accords could affect the Company’s business in
unpredictable ways.

Historically, the Company’s operating results have been subject to a seasonal
trend when measured on a quarterly basis. The first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest. This pattern is the result of, or is influenced by, numerous factors
including weather patterns, national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces. In addition, this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the
Company’s international network and service offerings. The Company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the Company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and, as a result, there can be no
assurance that historical patterns, if any, will continue in future periods.

Primarily as a result of
the global economic downturn, the Company’s air and ocean freight volumes were at exceptionally low levels in 2009 as compared to 2010 and 2008. The Company’s air and ocean volumes began to improve in the fourth quarter of 2009 and this
trend continued throughout 2010. Due to the uncertainty in the global economy, the Company cannot predict whether this trend will continue.

A significant portion of the Company’s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand, and from customers in industries whose shipping
patterns are dependent upon just-in-time production schedules. Therefore, the timing of the Company’s revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of the Company’s control, such as a sudden change in consumer demand for
retail goods and/or manufacturing production delays. Additionally, many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and therefore, the Company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a
quarter. To the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the
Company’s stock.

In terms of the opportunities, challenges and risks that management focused on in
2010, the Company operates in 60 countries throughout the world in the competitive global logistics industry and Company activities are tied directly to the global economy. From the inception of the Company, management has believed that the
elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting, training, and ultimately retaining superior personnel. The Company’s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a
consistent global corporate culture which demands:

•

Total dedication, first and foremost, to providing superior customer service;

•

Aggressive marketing of all of the Company’s service offerings;

| 23.


•

Ongoing development of key employees and management personnel via formal and informal means;

•

Creation of unlimited advancement opportunities for employees dedicated to hard work, personal growth, ethical behavior and continuous improvement;

•

Individual commitment to the identification and mentoring of successors for every key position so that when inevitable change is required, a qualified and
well-trained internal candidate is ready to step forward; and

•

Continuous identification, design and implementation of system solutions, both technological and otherwise, to meet and exceed the needs of our customers
while simultaneously delivering tools to make our employees more efficient and more effective.

The Company reinforces these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control. This compensation system has been in place since the Company became a
publicly traded entity. There is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success. The Company believes in a “real world” environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit
implications of their decisions. If these decisions result in operating losses, these losses must be made up from future operating profits, in the aggregate, before any cash incentive compensation can be earned. At the same time, the Company
insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection, cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career.

Any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a self-sustained basis throughout the Company provides a greater
threat to the Company’s continued success than any external force, which would be largely beyond our control. Consequently, management spends the majority of its time focused on creating an environment where employees can learn and develop
while also improving systems and taking preventative action to reduce exposure to negative events. The Company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that, in the aggregate, could have a positive or a negative impact
on future operations. As a result, our focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture of well-trained employees and managers that are prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the Company
adapt and thrive as major trends emerge.

Critical Accounting Estimates

A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in
this Annual Report.

Management believes that the nature of the Company’s business is such that
there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations.

While judgments and estimates are a
necessary component of any system of accounting, the Company’s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas:

•

accounts receivable valuation;

•

the accrual of costs related to ancillary services the Company provides;

•

accrual of insurance liabilities for the portion of the freight related exposure which the Company has self-insured;

•

accrual of various tax liabilities;

•

accrual of loss contingencies; and

•

calculation of share-based compensation expense.

These estimates, other than the accrual of loss contingencies and calculation of share-based compensation expense,
are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change. Management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are non-aggressive in approach and consistent in application. Management believes that
there are limited, if any, alternative accounting principles or methods which could

24. |


be applied to the Company’s transactions. While the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates, the Company believes
that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates, other than the calculation of share-based compensation expense, would not produce materially different results than those reported.

The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. An
estimated loss from a contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
Disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued, management evaluates several factors, including advice from outside counsel,
in order to estimate the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and make a reasonable estimate on the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and
operating cash flows.

As described in Note 1.I to the consolidated financial statements in this report,
the Company accounts for share-based compensation based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees under the Company’s stock option and stock purchase rights plans. This expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over
the option vesting periods.

Determining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock
compensation expense requires judgment. Any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment. Examples include assumptions about long-term stock price volatility, employee exercise patterns,
pre-vesting option forfeitures, post-vesting option terminations, and the future interest rates and dividend yields. The Company uses the Black-Scholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options. Refer to Note 2 in the consolidated
financial statements for the assumptions used for grants issued during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The assumptions used by the Company for estimating the fair value of options granted were developed on a basis consistent
with assumptions used for valuing previous grants.

Management believes that the assumptions used are
appropriate based upon the Company’s historical and currently expected future experience. Looking to future events, management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any
future deviation may be material.

The Company’s expected volatility assumptions are based on the
historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the
option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for U.S. Treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option, i.e. a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an option with a ten year expected life.
The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s historical experience. The forfeiture rate used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical pre-vesting employee forfeiture patterns.

The use of different assumptions would result in different amounts of stock compensation expense. Keeping all other
variables constant, the indicated change in each of the assumptions below increases or decreases the fair value of an option (and the resulting stock compensation expense), as follows:

The fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life
assumptions. The pre-vesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate. Therefore, changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period.
Different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense

| 25.


recognition over the vesting period. Estimated forfeitures will be reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009–No. 13
“Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

”

, which amends FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605 –“Revenue Recognition”. This provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables, measuring and
allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. This update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. ASU 2009–No. 13 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or
materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of this update beginning in the first quarter of 2011. The Company has assessed the impact of the adoption of
ASU 2009–No. 13 and it is not expecting this update will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.

Results of Operations

The following table shows the
consolidated net revenues (revenues less transportation expenses) attributable to the Company’s principal services and the Company’s expenses for 2010, 2009, and 2008, expressed as percentages of net revenues. Management believes that
net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the Company’s principal services since total revenues earned by the Company as a freight consolidator include the carriers’ charges to the Company for
carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the Company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the Company.

26. |


2010 compared with 2009

Airfreight services net revenues in 2010 increased 31% as compared with 2009. The increase in global airfreight services net
revenues was primarily due to a 35% increase in airfreight tonnage, which was partially offset by a slight decrease in net revenue per kilo. North America, Asia Pacific and Europe airfreight services net revenues increased 34%, 39% and 15%,
respectively, in 2010 as compared with 2009, while airfreight export tonnage increased 47%, 32% and 28%, respectively. The increase in airfreight tonnage is primarily due to improvements in the global economy which began in the fourth quarter of
2009.

Ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 19% in 2010 as compared with 2009. North
America, Asia Pacific and Europe ocean freight net revenues increased approximately 17%, 23% and 13%, respectively, in 2010 as compared with 2009.

Ocean freight net revenues are comprised of three basic services: ocean freight consolidation, direct ocean
forwarding and order management. The majority of the Company’s ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 51% and 52% of ocean freight net revenue in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Ocean freight consolidation net revenue increased 16% in 2010 as compared with 2009, primarily due to a 20%
increase in volume as measured in terms of forty-foot container equivalent units (FEUs), partially offset by a 3% decrease in net revenue per container. Direct ocean freight forwarding and order management, which are primarily fee-based, increased
15% and 34%, respectively, in 2010, as compared with 2009, due to an increase in volume.

The increase
in ocean volumes is primarily due to an improvement in the global economy which began in the fourth quarter of 2009. Net revenue per container in 2010 was lower than in 2009 due to favorable spot market buying opportunities in the first half of 2009
that were not available in 2010.

Customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased 17% in
2010 as compared with 2009, primarily as a result of increases in international air and ocean and domestic time definite freight volumes. Customers continue to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an
overall logistics management program, including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment.

Salaries and related costs, excluding stock compensation expense, increased 16% in 2010, as compared with 2009, primarily as a result of larger bonuses earned from achieving higher operating income before bonuses,
an increase in the number of employees, and higher stock compensation expense.

The effects of including
stock-based compensation expense in salaries and related costs for 2010 and 2009 are as follows:

Excluding stock compensation expense, salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased 292
basis points for 2010, as compared with 2009. This decrease can be attributed to productivity gains that resulted from more efficient staff utilization. Stock compensation expense increased 12% in 2010, as compared with 2009, primarily a result of a
$4 million “true up” credit recognized in 2009 for the difference between the higher actual pre-vesting forfeiture experience and the pre-vesting forfeiture assumptions used to calculate stock option expense. The net impact on salaries and
related costs was $3 million after consideration of the effect on bonuses.

| 27.


Historically, the relatively consistent relationship between salaries
and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the Company: offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the
business unit controlled by each key employee. Using this compensation model, changes in individual incentive compensation will occur in proportion to changes in Company profits, creating a direct alignment between corporate performance and
shareholder interests. Bonuses to field and corporate management in 2010 were up 35% as compared with 2009 primarily as a result of a 42% increase in operating income. The Company’s management incentive compensation programs have always been
incentive-based and performance driven and there is no built-in bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performance.

Because the Company’s management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative, no management bonuses
can be paid unless the relevant business unit is, from inception, cumulatively profitable. Any operating losses must have been offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus. Since the most significant
portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs, the Company believes that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by its managers. Due to the nature of the Company’s services, it has a
short operating cycle. The outcome of any higher risk transactions, such as overriding established credit limits, would be known in a relatively short time frame. Management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully
considered in light of this short operating cycle, the potential for short term gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking. Management
believes that both the stability and the long term growth in revenues, net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in the Company’s compensation program.

Other overhead expenses increased 12% in 2010, as compared with 2009, primarily as a result of higher business
taxes, travel and other expenses related to increased activity. Legal and related expenses increased slightly in 2010, as compared with 2009, primarily attributable to preparing the Company’s responses to a Statement of Objections issued by the
European Commission as described further in Part I — Item 3 in this report on Form 10-K entitled “Legal Proceedings”. The Company will continue to incur legal costs, which could be substantial and include judgments, fines and/or
penalties, until the legal proceedings described in Item 3 herein are concluded. Further, the Company periodically conducts reviews of the operations and procedures of its offices worldwide relating to compliance with applicable laws and
regulations. If the governmental regulatory agencies conclude that the Company has engaged in anti-competitive behavior or in the event of an adverse judgment in the class action lawsuit described in Item 3 herein, such judgments, fines and/or
penalties could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and operating cash flows. Other overhead expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased slightly for 2010, as compared with 2009.

Other income, net, decreased 6% in 2010, as compared with 2009. Interest income decreased $3 million
due to lower average interest rates during 2010, as compared with 2009.

The Company pays income taxes
in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations. The Company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2010 was 38.9% as compared to 40.3% for 2009. Although a tax
benefit related to stock-based compensation expense is recorded for non-qualified stock options at the time the related compensation expense is recognized, the tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options cannot be
anticipated. The lower consolidated effective income tax rate for 2010, as compared 2009, is primarily the result of a higher tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options for 2010, as compared with 2009.

2009 compared with 2008

Airfreight services net revenues in 2009 decreased 15% compared with 2008. The decrease in global airfreight services net revenues was primarily due to a 13% decline in airfreight tonnage. North America, Asia
Pacific and Europe airfreight services net revenues decreased 13%, 15% and 21%, respectively, in 2009 as compared with 2008, while airfreight export tonnage decreased 16%, 13% and 10%, respectively.

28. |


The decrease in airfreight tonnage is primarily due to the global
economic downturn which began in the second half of 2008. During the first six months of 2009, net revenue per kilo increased as compared to the same period in 2008, as a result of favorable buying opportunities that developed in a number of
short-term spot markets. This increase was offset during the second half of 2009, as air carriers removed significant capacity from the markets while rapidly and aggressively increasing airfreight pricing, particularly in Asia. The Company absorbed
these price increases during the short-term, prior to negotiations with and acceptance by the Company’s customers. North America and Asia Pacific net revenues declined primarily due to lower export tonnage in 2009 as compared to 2008. Europe
net revenues declined principally due to lower export tonnage and lower import volumes, primarily from Asia.

Ocean freight and ocean services net revenues decreased 18% in 2009 as compared with 2008. North America, Asia Pacific and Europe ocean freight net revenues decreased approximately 19%, 18% and 21%, respectively,
in 2009 as compared with 2008.

Ocean freight net revenues are comprised of three basic services: ocean
freight consolidation, direct ocean forwarding and order management. The majority of the Company’s ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 52% and 59% of ocean freight net revenue in 2009 and
2008, respectively.

Ocean freight consolidation net revenue decreased 27% in 2009 as compared with
2008, primarily due to a 17% decrease in volume and a 13% decrease in net revenue per container. Direct ocean freight forwarding, which is primarily fee-based, decreased 8% in 2009, as compared with 2008, due to a decrease in volume. Order
management remained relatively constant in 2009 as compared with 2008.

The decrease in ocean volumes is
primarily due to the global economic downturn. Net revenue per container increased in the first half of 2009, as compared with 2008, as a result of favorable buying opportunities that developed in a number of short-term spot markets. Steamship lines
removed significant capacity from the market and implemented price increases in the second half of 2009, particularly on the Pacific North America lanes. The combination of these moves eliminated the favorable buying opportunities that existed in
the first half of 2009. These price increases were absorbed by the Company during the second half of 2009, prior to negotiations with and acceptance by the Company’s customers.

Customs brokerage and other services net revenues decreased 10% in 2009 as compared with 2008, primarily as a
result of declines in air and ocean freight volumes.

Salaries and related costs decreased 10% in 2009,
as compared with 2008, primarily as a result of (i) smaller bonuses due to lower operating income, (ii) an overall decrease in base salaries directly related to a lower headcount and (iii) lower stock compensation expense.

The effect of including stock-based compensation expense in salaries and related costs for 2009 and 2008 are as
follows:

Excluding stock compensation expense, salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenue increased 208
basis points for 2009, as compared with 2008. This increase is largely due to the fixed nature of base salaries and management’s commitment to maintaining its people during this economic downturn. Stock compensation expense declined 13% in
2009, as compared with 2008, primarily a result of a $4 million “true up” credit recognized in the first quarter of 2009 for the difference between the higher actual pre-vesting forfeiture experience and the pre-vesting forfeiture
assumptions used to calculate stock option expense. The net impact on

| 29.


salaries and related costs was $3 million after consideration of the effect on bonuses. This credit relates primarily to stock option grants made in 2006, the majority of which began vesting in
May 2009.

The Company’s operating income in 2009 was 19% lower than the amount reported in 2008.
This was the first year since 1984 that the Company’s operating income was lower than the amount which had been reported in the previous year. Bonuses to field and corporate management in 2009 were also both down 19% as compared with 2008. The
Company’s management incentive compensation programs have always been incentive-based and performance driven and there is no built-in bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performance.

Other overhead expenses decreased 16% in 2009, as compared with 2008, primarily as a result of
continued cost reduction measures, including cutbacks on travel and entertainment expenses. Legal and related expenses decreased approximately $11 million in 2009, as compared with 2008, primarily attributable to lower activity related to
governmental regulatory agencies’ ongoing investigations of air cargo freight forwarders and related legal proceedings as described further in Part I—Item 3 in this report on Form 10-K entitled “Legal Proceedings”. Other overhead
expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained constant for 2009, as compared with 2008.

Other
income, net, decreased 32% in 2009, as compared with 2008. Interest income decreased $11 million due to lower average interest rates during 2009, as compared with 2008.

The Company pays income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as other taxes which are
typically included in costs of operations. The Company’s consolidated effective income tax rate in 2009 was 40.3% as compared to 39.4% for 2008. The higher consolidated effective income tax rate for 2009, as compared 2008, is primarily the
result of a lower tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options for 2009, as compared with 2008.

Currency and Other Risk Factors

International air/ocean
freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. There are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry; however, the Company’s
primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group. Historically, the industry has experienced consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multi-service
networks. However, regional and local broker/forwarders remain a competitive force.

The primary
competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service, including reliability, responsiveness, expertise, convenience, and scope of operations. The Company emphasizes quality customer service and
believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry. Larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as just-in-time
inventory management. The Company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage. Accordingly, sophisticated computerized customer service
capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers.

Developing these systems and a worldwide network adds a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers. Smaller and middle-tier competitors, in general, do not have the resources available to
develop customized systems and a worldwide network.

The nature of the Company’s worldwide
operations necessitates the Company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This results in the Company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental
interference. Some of the countries where the Company maintains offices and/or agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the Company’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. The Company tries
to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents. The Company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial
limitations on the Company’s ability to move money freely around the world or the short-term financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most time-sensitive way to avoid short-term exchange losses. Any such hedging
activity during 2010,

30. |


2009 and 2008 was insignificant. Net foreign currency gains in 2010 and 2009 were $2 million and $1 million, respectively. Net foreign currency losses in 2008 were $191,000. The Company
had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Geographic Coverage

During 2010, the Company opened three full-service offices: 1) Curitiba, Brazil; 2) Oslo, Norway; and 3) Zhongshan,
People’s Republic of China (formerly a satellite of Shenzhen, People’s Republic of China). The Company opened two satellite offices: 1) Belo Horizonte, Brazil; and 2) Rome, Italy. The Company changed the Macau, People’s Republic of
China office from a full service to a satellite office and closed one satellite office in Lewiston, New York.

Acquisitions – Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the Company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant
“goodwill,” the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business. As a result, the Company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by
certain strategic acquisitions, where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the “goodwill” recorded in the transaction.

Internal Growth – Management believes that a comparison of “same store” results is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the Company’s internally generated growth. The
“same store” analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the Company’s operating results for at least one full year. There were no significant differences between the “same
store” analysis and the Company’s results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating
activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $396 million, as compared with $331 million for 2009. This $65 million increase is primarily due to an increase in net earnings offset by
changes in working capital accounts, primarily an increase in accounts receivable. At December 31, 2010, working capital was $1,278 million, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,085 million. The Company had no
long-term debt at December 31, 2010.

The Company’s business is subject to seasonal
fluctuations. Cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality. Historically, the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings. This results in positive cash flow. The increased activity
associated with peak season (typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter) causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections. This cyclical growth in customer receivables
consumes available cash.

As a customs broker, the Company makes significant cash advances for a select
group of its credit-worthy customers. These cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world. Cash advances are a “pass through” and are not
recorded as a component of revenue and expense. The billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs
authorities. As a result of these “pass through” billings, the conventional Days Sales Outstanding or DSO calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency.

Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $42 million, as compared with $41
million for 2009. The largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures. The Company does have need, on occasion, to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers’
freight. The Company routinely invests in technology, leasehold improvements, equipment, and office furniture. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company made capital expenditures of $42 million as compared with $40 million for
2009, which includes prepayments on long-term land leases. This includes normal capital expenditures as noted above and $13 million for real estate development. Total capital expenditures in 2011 are currently estimated to be $117 million. This
includes normal capital expenditures as noted above, plus additional

| 31.


real estate development. In 2010, the Company entered into contracts to develop office/warehouse facilities in London, United Kingdom and in Beijing, China and these projects are expected to be
completed in 2011.

Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $209
million as compared with $117 million in 2009. The Company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the Company’s common stock on the open market. In 2010, the Company continued its policy of repurchasing stock to
limit growth in issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises. The increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared with the same period in 2009 is primarily due to a
greater number of shares repurchased and a higher average price per share. During 2010 and 2009 the net use of cash in financing activities included the payment of dividends of $.40 per share and $.38 per share, respectively.

The Company follows established guidelines relating to credit quality, diversification and maturities of its
investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity. The Company’s investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by the disruption in the credit markets. However there can be no assurance that the Company’s investment portfolio
will not be adversely affected in the future.

The Company cannot forecast the impact that ongoing
uncertainties in the global economy will have on its operating results. Management believes that the Company has effective credit control procedures, and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problems. The Company cannot
predict what fallout economic uncertainties may have on freight volumes, pricing, changes in consumer demand, supplier stability and capacity or on customers’ abilities to pay.

The Company maintains international unsecured bank lines of credit. At December 31, 2010, the
international bank lines of credit totaled $22 million. At December 31, 2010, the Company had no amounts outstanding on these lines of credit, but was contingently liable for $91 million from standby letters of credit and
guarantees. The standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers, primarily airlines, and for duty and tax
deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and value-added-tax (VAT) taxation. The total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the
books of the respective foreign subsidiaries, and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company is required to perform.

At December 31, 2010, the Company’s contractual obligations are as
follows:

The Company enters into short-term agreements with asset-based providers
reserving space on a guaranteed basis. The pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions. The Company only

32. |


enters into agreements that management believes the Company can fulfill with relative ease. Historically, the Company has not paid for guaranteed space that it has not used. Management
believes, in line with historical experience, committed purchase obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2010, will be fulfilled during 2011 in the Company’s ordinary course of business.

The Company has a Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option
exercises. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had repurchased and retired 21,870,052 shares of common stock at an average price of $21.24 per share over the period from 1994 through 2010. During 2010, 2,235,613 shares were
repurchased at an average price of $44.41 per share.

The Company has a Discretionary Stock Repurchase
Plan under which Management is allowed to repurchase such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 200,000,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had repurchased and retired
20,067,005 shares of common stock at an average price of $34.37 per share over the period from 2001 through 2010. During 2010, 3,218,407 shares were repurchased at an average price of $45.69 per share. These discretionary repurchases were
made to limit the growth in the number of issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises and the exercise of employee stock purchase rights.

Management believes that the Company’s current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to
meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future, including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations.

In some cases, the Company’s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign
exchange controls. At December 31, 2010, cash and cash equivalent balances of $561 million were held by the Company’s non-United States subsidiaries, of which $66 million was held in banks in the United States.

Impact of Inflation

To date, the Company’s business has not been adversely affected by inflation. Direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short- to medium-term period. Due to the high degree of competition in
the market place, these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the Company’s margins. As the Company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest
rate-sensitive indebtedness, the Company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31,
2010, the Company did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

| 33.


ITEM 7A — QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business. These risks are primarily related
to foreign exchange risk and changes in short-term interest rates. The potential impact of the Company’s exposure to these risks is presented below:

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company conducts business in
many different countries and currencies. The Company’s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred. In the ordinary course
of business, the Company creates numerous intercompany transactions and may hold currencies that are not the local functional currency. This brings foreign exchange risk to the Company’s earnings.

Foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the Company’s
earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, the Company’s functional currency, relative to the other currencies in which the Company transacts business. All other things being equal, an average 10%
weakening of the U.S. dollar, throughout the year ended December 31, 2010, would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately $40 million. An average 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar, for the same period, would have
the effect of reducing operating income approximately $32 million. This analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation. For example, a weakening in the U.S. dollar would
be expected to increase exports from the United States and decrease imports into the United States over some relevant period of time, but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately $1 million of net unsettled intercompany
transactions. The Company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations
restrict the Company’s ability to move money freely. Any such hedging activity throughout the year ended December 31, 2010, was insignificant. Net foreign currency gains in 2010 and 2009 were $2 million and $1 million,
respectively. Net foreign currency losses in 2008 were $191,000. The Company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The Company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency
settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings. The majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within 90
days.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2010, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,085 million, of which $641
million was invested at various short-term market interest rates. The Company had no short-term borrowings at December 31, 2010. A hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at December 31, 2010 would not have a
significant impact on the Company’s earnings.

In management’s opinion, there has been no
material change in the Company’s interest rate risk exposure between 2009 and 2010.

ITEM 8 — FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

The following documents are filed on the pages listed below, as part of Part II, Item 8 of this report.

ITEM 9 — CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A — CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Controls and Procedures

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at the
reasonable assurance level.

Changes in Internal Controls

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

We have confidence in the Company’s internal controls and procedures. Nevertheless, the Company’s
management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s disclosure procedures and controls or the Company’s internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional
fraud. An internal control system, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met. Further, the design of an internal control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all the Company’s control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

| 35.


Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s
management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

A system of internal control can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2010, based on the framework in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this
assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, which is included on page
F-2.

COMPRISING ITEM 8

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

TO SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION FOR THE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009, AND 2008


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 28, 2011 expressed
an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.:

We have audited Expeditors
International of Washington, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010 and our report dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.  |  Basis of
Presentation

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (“the Company”) is a non-asset based provider
of global logistics services operating through a worldwide network of offices, international service centers and exclusive or non-exclusive agents. The Company’s customers include retailing and wholesaling, electronics, and manufacturing
companies around the world.

International trade is influenced by many factors, including economic and
political conditions in the United States and abroad, currency exchange rates, and laws and policies relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, foreign investments and taxation. Periodically, governments consider a variety of changes to current
tariffs and trade restrictions. The Company cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals may be adopted, nor can the Company predict the effects adoption of any such proposal will have on the Company’s business. Doing business in
foreign locations also subjects the Company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises. In addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade, the Company’s
business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies as well as economic turbulence or security concerns in the nations in which it does business.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries stated in U.S. dollars, the
Company’s reporting currency. In addition, the consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of operating entities where the Company maintains a parent-subsidiary relationship through unilateral control over assets and
operations together with responsibility for payment of all liabilities, notwithstanding a lack of technical majority ownership of the subsidiary common stock. Certain 2009 and 2008 amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2010
presentation. All dollar amounts in the notes are presented in thousands except for share data.

All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

B.  |  Cash
Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of purchase are considered
to be cash equivalents.

C.  |  Short-term Investments

Short-term investments have a maturity date of greater than three months at date of purchase and are designated as
available-for-sale. Cost approximates market at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

D.  |  Accounts
Receivable

The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is reviewed at least monthly for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments for services and advances. Additional allowances may be necessary in the future if the ability of its customers to pay deteriorates. The Company has recorded an
allowance for doubtful accounts in the amounts of $14,636, $14,235 and $14,414 as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Additions and write-offs have not been significant in any of these years.

F-12. |


E.  |  Long-Lived Assets, Depreciation and Amortization

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated or amortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the
assets’ estimated useful lives or lease terms. Useful lives for major categories of property and equipment are as follows:

Land Improvements

50 years

Buildings

28 to 40 years

Furniture, fixtures, equipment and purchased software

3 to 5 years

Expenditures for
maintenance, repairs, and replacements of minor items are charged to earnings as incurred. Major upgrades and improvements that extend the life of the asset are capitalized. Upon disposition, the cost and related accumulated depreciation
are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in income for the period.

For
the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company performed the required goodwill annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and determined that no impairment had occurred.

Other intangibles consist principally of payments made to purchase customer lists of agents in countries where the
Company established its own presence by opening offices. Other intangibles assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives for periods up to 15 years and are reviewed for impairment if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment
loss may be been incurred. The estimated annual amortization expense for each of the next five years is not significant.

F.  |  Revenues and Revenue Recognition

The Company derives its revenues from three principal sources: 1) airfreight services, 2) ocean freight and ocean services, and 3)
customs brokerage and other services. These are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements.

As a non-asset based carrier, the Company does not own transportation assets. Rather, the Company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from
direct (asset-based) carriers and reselling those services to its customers. The difference between the rate billed to customers (the sell rate), and the rate paid to the carrier (the buy rate) is termed “net revenue” or
“yield”. By consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power, the Company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers, while at the same time offering lower sell rates than
customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves.

Airfreight services revenues include the
charges to the Company for carrying the shipments when the Company acts as a freight consolidator. Ocean freight services revenues include the charges to the Company for carrying the shipments when the Company acts as a Non-Vessel Operating
Common Carrier (NVOCC). In each case the Company is acting as an indirect carrier. When acting as an indirect carrier, the Company will issue a House Airway Bill (HAWB) or a House Ocean Bill of Lading (HOBL) to customers as the contract of
carriage. In turn, when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier, the Company receives a contract of carriage known as a Master Airway Bill for airfreight shipments and a Master Ocean Bill of Lading for ocean shipments. At
this point, the risk of loss passes to the carrier, however, in order to claim for any such loss, the customer is first obligated to pay the freight charges.

Based upon the terms in the contract of carriage, revenues related to shipments where the Company issues an HAWB or
an HOBL are recognized at the time the freight is tendered to the direct carrier at origin. Costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this same time.

Revenues realized in other capacities, for instance, when the Company acts as an agent for the shipper, and does
not issue an HAWB or an HOBL, include only the commissions and fees earned for the services performed. These revenues are recognized upon completion of the services.

| F-13.


Customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at
destination, such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation, calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections
by governmental agencies, and arranging for delivery. This is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the Company has offices. Revenues related to
customs brokerage and other services are recognized upon completion of the services. Arranging international shipments is a complex task. Each actual movement can require multiple services. In some instances, the Company is asked to
perform only one of these services. However, in most instances, the Company may perform multiple services. These services include destination breakbulk services and value added ancillary services such as local transportation, export
customs formalities, distribution services and logistics management. Each of these services has an associated fee which is recognized as revenue upon completion of the service.

Typically, the fees for each of these services are quoted as separate components, however, customers on occasion
will request an all-inclusive rate for a set of services known in the industry as “door-to-door service.” This means that the customer is billed a single rate for all services from pickup at origin to delivery at destination. In
these instances, the revenue for origin and destination services, as well as revenue that will be characterized as freight charges, is allocated to branches as set by preexisting Company policy perhaps supplemented by customer specific negotiations
between the offices involved. Each of the Company’s branches are separate profit centers and the primary compensation for the branch management group comes in the form of incentive-based compensation calculated directly from the operating
income of that branch. This compensation structure ensures that the allocation of revenue and expense among components of services, when provided under an all-inclusive rate, is done in an objective manner on a relative selling price basis.

The Company presents revenues net of sales and value-added taxes.

G.  |  Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, the tax effect of loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized. The Company recognizes interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits
or underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and recognizes penalties in operating expenses.

H.  |  Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders per Common Share

Diluted earnings attributable to shareholders per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and
dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive potential common shares represent outstanding stock options and stock purchase rights. Basic earnings attributable to shareholders per share is calculated using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding without taking into consideration dilutive potential common shares outstanding.

I.  |  Stock Plans

The Company recognizes stock compensation expense based on an estimate of the fair value of awards granted to employees and directors under the Company’s stock option, director restricted stock and employee
stock purchase rights plans. This expense, adjusted for expected forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the stock awards vesting periods.

F-14. |


J.  |  Foreign Currency

Foreign currency amounts attributable to foreign operations have been translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates
for assets and liabilities, historical rates for equity, and weighted average rates for revenues and expenses. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded as components of other comprehensive income. Currency
fluctuations are a normal operating factor in the conduct of the Company’s business and exchange transaction gains and losses are included in revenues and operating expenses. Also, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange
fluctuations on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local functional currency. Foreign exchange gains and losses on such balances are recognized in net earnings as other income.

The Company follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage its foreign exchange
exposure. Accordingly, the Company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the Company’s ability to move money freely around the world. Such
hedging activity during 2010, 2009, and 2008 was insignificant. Net foreign currency gains in 2010 and 2009 were $2,026 and $1,418, respectively. Net foreign currency losses in 2008 were $191. The Company had no foreign currency derivatives
outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

K.  |  Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income consists of net earnings and other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from
net earnings. For the Company, these consist of foreign currency translation gains and losses, net of related income tax effects and comprehensive income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest.

Accumulated other comprehensive income consisted entirely of foreign currency translation adjustments, net of
related income tax effects, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

L.  |  Segment Reporting

The Company is organized functionally in geographic operating segments. Accordingly, management focuses its attention on
revenues, net revenues, operating income, identifiable assets, capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization and equity generated in each of these geographical areas when evaluating effectiveness of geographic management. The Company
charges its subsidiaries and affiliates for services rendered in the United States on a cost recovery basis. Transactions among the Company’s various offices are conducted using the same arms-length pricing methodologies the Company uses
when its offices transact business with independent agents.

M.  |  Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The Company uses
estimates primarily in the following areas: accounts receivable valuation, accrual of costs related to ancillary services the Company provides, accrual of insurance liabilities for the portion of the freight related exposure which the Company has
self-insured, accrual of various tax liabilities, accrual of loss contingencies and calculation of share-based compensation expense. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

N.  |  Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009–No. 13
“Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements”, which amends Accounting Standards Codification Topic

| F-15.


605 –“Revenue Recognition”. This update provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables, measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of
accounting. This update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. ASU 2009–No. 13 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
June 15, 2010. The Company is required to and plans to adopt the provisions of this update beginning in the first quarter of 2011. The Company has assessed the impact of the adoption of ASU 2009–No. 13 it is not expecting this update will
have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.

NOTE 2.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

A.  |  Stock Repurchase
Plans

The Company has a Non-Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan, originally approved by the Board of Directors in
November 1993, under which management is authorized to repurchase up to 40,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock in the open market with the proceeds received from the exercise of employee and director stock options.

In November 2001, the Board of Directors expanded the Company’s Discretionary Stock Repurchase Plan to allow
for the repurchase of such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to 200,000,000 shares of common stock.

The following table summarizes by repurchase plan the Company’s repurchasing activity:

B.  |  Stock Option Plans

At December 31, 2010, the Company has two stock option plans (the “1985 Plan” and the “2010 Plan”) under which the Board of Directors may grant officers and employees options to purchase
common stock at prices equal to or greater than market value on the date of grant. On May 5, 2010, the shareholders approved the Company’s 2010 Plan, which made available a total of 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock for
purchase upon exercise of options granted under the 2010 Plan. The 1985 Plan provides for non-qualified grants. The 2010 Plan provides for qualified and non-qualified grants. Grants under the 2010 Plan are limited to not more than 100,000 shares per
person. No additional shares can be granted under the 2010 Plan after April 30, 2011. Outstanding options generally vest and become exercisable over periods up to five years from the date of grant and expire no more than 10 years from the date
of grant.

Upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive
stock options, the Company derives a tax deduction measured by the excess of the market value over the option price at the date of exercise or disqualifying disposition. The portion of the benefit from the deduction which equals the estimated fair
value of the options (previously recognized as compensation expense) is recorded as a credit to the deferred tax asset for non-qualified stock options and is recorded as a credit to current tax expense for any disqualified dispositions of incentive
stock options. All of the tax benefit received upon option exercise for the tax deduction in excess of the estimated fair value of the options is credited to additional paid-in capital.

F-16. |


The following table summarizes by plan stock option activity and
shares available for granting of options:

C.  |  Stock Purchase Plan

In May 2002, the shareholders approved the Company’s 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2002 Plan”), which became
effective August 1, 2002. The Company’s amended 2002 Plan provides for 9,305,452 shares of the Company’s common stock to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of purchase rights granted to employees who elect to participate through
regular payroll deductions beginning August 1 of each year. The purchase rights are exercisable on July 31 of the following year at a price equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the
last trading day in July or (2) 85% of the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the first trading day in August of the preceding year. A total of 5,901,973 shares have been issued under the 2002 Plan and $12,080 have been
withheld from employees at December 31, 2010 in connection with the plan year ending July 31, 2011.

D.  |  Director Restricted Stock Plan

In May 2008, the shareholders approved the Company’s 2008 Directors’ Restricted Stock Plan (the
2008 Directors’ Plan), which provides for annual awards of restricted stock to non-employee directors and makes 200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock available for grant. The 2008 Directors’ Plan replaced the 1993
Directors’ Non-qualified Stock Option Plan. The plan provides for an annual grant of restricted stock awards with a fair market value equal to $200,000 to each participant on June 1

st

of each year. There are 118,902 shares available for grant under the 2008 Directors’ Plan as of December 31, 2010. Each restricted stock award under the 2008
Directors’ Plan vests in equal amounts monthly over one year. Restricted shares entitle the grantees to all shareholder rights once vested, except for cash dividends and transfer rights which are forfeited until the final vesting date of the
award. If a non-employee director’s service is terminated, any unvested portion of an award will be forfeited unless the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines otherwise.

| F-17.


E.  |  Stock Option Activity

The following table summarizes information about stock options:

F.  |  Share-Based Compensation Expense

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following assumptions:

The Company’s expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s
stock. The expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve
in effect at the time of grant for U.S. Treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option, i.e. a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an option with a ten year expected life. The expected dividend yield is based on the
Company’s historical experience. The forfeiture assumption used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical pre-vesting employee forfeiture patterns.

The compensation for restricted stock awards is based on the fair market value of the Company’s share of
common stock on the date of grant. In 2010, 26,735 restricted shares were granted with a fair value per share of $37.40.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $135 million, $38 million and $61 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2010, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, unvested
restricted stock awards and stock purchase rights is $78 million and the weighted average period over which that cost is expected to be recognized is 3.0 years.

F-18. |


Total stock compensation expense and the total related tax benefit
recognized are as follows:

Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises, restricted stock awards and employee stock plan purchases are
issued as new shares outstanding by the Company’s transfer agent.

NOTE 4.

INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense includes the
following components:

Income tax expense differs from amounts computed by applying the United States
Federal income tax rate of 35% to earnings before income taxes as a result of the following:

The components of earnings before income taxes are as follows:

F-20. |


The tax effects of temporary differences and tax credits that give
rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:

Based on management’s review of the Company’s tax positions, the
Company had no significant unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

The Company
or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to
2007. With respect to state and local jurisdictions and countries outside of the United States, with limited exceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2001. In the normal course of
business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes that adequate amounts of tax, interest and penalties have been provided for any
adjustments that may result from these open tax years. Any interest and penalties expensed in relation to the underpayment of income taxes were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

| F-21.


NOTE 5.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company’s financial
instruments, other than cash, consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses. The carrying value of these financial instruments approximates their fair value. Cash
equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of purchase. Short term investments have a maturity of greater than three months at date of purchase. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
consist of the following:

The fair value of corporate commercial paper is based on the use of market
interest rates for identical or similar assets.

NOTE 6.

CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

Certain of the Company’s foreign
subsidiaries maintain bank lines of credit for short-term working capital purposes. These credit lines are supported by standby letters of credit issued by a United States bank, or guarantees issued by the Company to the foreign banks issuing
the credit line. Amounts available for borrowing under lines of credit totaled $21,857 and $25,839 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2010, the Company had no amounts outstanding under these lines and
was contingently liable for approximately $91,495 under outstanding standby letters of credit and guarantees.

The standby letters of credit and guarantees relate to obligations of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers, primarily airlines, and for
duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and value-added-tax (VAT) taxation. The total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as
obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries, and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company were to be required to perform.

At December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants of these credit lines and
the associated credit facilities.

NOTE 7.

COMMITMENTS

A.  |  Leases

The Company occupies office and warehouse facilities under terms of operating leases expiring up to 2020. The Company
also has two long term operating lease arrangements to use land, for which the usage rights were entirely prepaid in 2009 and 2007. Usage rights for those arrangements are recognized in rent expense over the lease terms up to 2057. Total rent
expense for all operating leases in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $54,024, $52,581 and $54,059, respectively.

At December 31, 2010, future minimum annual lease payments under all noncancelable leases are as follows:

B.  |  Unconditional Purchase Obligations

The Company enters into short-term agreements with asset-based providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis. The pricing of
these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions. The Company only enters into agreements that management believes the Company can fulfill with relative ease. Historically, the Company has not paid for guaranteed space that it has not
used. Management believes, in line with historical experience, committed purchase obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2010 of $180,202, will be fulfilled during 2011 in the Company’s ordinary course of business.

C.  |  Employee Benefits

The Company has employee savings plans under which the Company provides a discretionary matching contribution. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company’s contributions under the plans were $6,127, $6,100, and
$6,196, respectively.

NOTE 8.

CONTINGENCIES

On October 10, 2007, the U. S.
Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a subpoena ordering the Company to produce certain information and records relating to an investigation of alleged anti-competitive behavior amongst air cargo freight forwarders. The Company has retained the
services of a law firm to assist in complying with the DOJ’s subpoena. As part of this process, the Company has met with and continues to co-operate with the DOJ. The Company expects to incur additional costs during the course of this ongoing
investigation, which could include fines and/or penalties if the DOJ concludes that the Company has engaged in anti-competitive behavior and such fines and/or penalties could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results
of operations and operating cash flows.

On January 3, 2008, the Company was named as a defendant,
with seven other European and North American-based global logistics providers, in a Federal antitrust class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court of the Eastern District of New York, Precision Associates, Inc. et al v. Panalpina
World Transport,

| F-23.


No. 08-CV0042. On July 21, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding a number of new third party defendants and various claims which they assert to violate the Sherman Act.
The plaintiffs’ amended complaint, which purports to be brought on behalf of a class of customers (and has not yet been certified), asserts claims that the defendants engaged in price fixing regarding eight discrete surcharges in violation of
the Sherman Act. The allegations concerning the Company relate to two of these surcharges. The amended complaint seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief. The Company believes that these allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously
defend itself. On August 13, 2009, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim, which is currently pending before the Court. Plaintiffs filed their opposition to the Company’s motion on
January 30, 2010 and the motion is currently pending before the Court.

On June 18, 2008, the
European Commission (EC) issued a request for information to the Company’s UK subsidiary, Expeditors International (UK) Ltd., requesting certain information relating to an ongoing investigation of freight forwarders. The Company replied to the
request. On February 18, 2009, the EC issued another request for information to the same subsidiary requesting certain additional information in connection with the EC’s ongoing investigation of freight forwarders. The Company replied to
the request. On February 10, 2010, the Company and its Hong Kong subsidiary, Expeditors Hong Kong Limited, received a Statement of Objections (SO) from the EC. The SO initiates a proceeding against the Company alleging anti-competitive behavior
contrary to European Union rules on competition. Specific to the Company, the allegations in the SO are limited to the period from August 2005 to June 2006 and only concern airfreight trade lanes between South China/Hong Kong and the European
Economic Area. The Company filed a response to the allegations in the SO on April 12, 2010 and participated in an oral hearing on July 6, 2010. On January 20, 2011, the EC issued another request for information to the Company and its
Hong Kong subsidiary requesting certain additional information in connection with its on-going investigation of freight forwarders. The Company replied to the request. The Company continues to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. The
Company expects to incur additional costs during the course of this ongoing proceeding, which could include administrative fines if the EC concludes that the Company has engaged in anti-competitive behavior and such fines could have a material
impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and operating cash flows.

On
August 17, 2010, the Company and its Brazilian subsidiary, Expeditors Internacional do Brasil Ltda received an Administrative Proceeding (AP) from the Brazilian Ministry of Justice (MOJ). The AP initiates a proceeding against the Company and
one of its employees, alleging possible anti-competitive behavior. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. The Company expects to incur additional costs during the course of this proceeding, which could include
administrative fines if the MOJ concludes that the Company has engaged in anti-competitive behavior and such fines could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and operating cash flows.

The Company has incurred approximately $1 million, less than $1 million and $10 million for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in legal and associated costs on the above matters. Since the beginning of the proceedings in 2007, the Company has incurred approximately $15 million in legal and associated costs on the above
matters. At this time the Company is unable to estimate the range of loss or damages, if any, that might result as an outcome of any of these proceedings. These government investigations and the related litigation matters are subject to inherent
uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include substantial monetary damages and, in matters in which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, an injunction or other order relating to business
conduct. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations, and operating cash flows could be materially harmed.

The Company is involved in other claims and lawsuits which arise in the ordinary course of business, none of which
currently, in management’s opinion, will have a significant effect on the Company’s operations or financial position.
