                                    Part I

Item 1 - Business

General

     Lowe's Companies, Inc. (the Company or Lowe's) is the second largest
retailer of home improvement products in the world, with a specific emphasis
on retail do-it-yourself (DIY) and commercial business customers.  Lowe's
specializes in offering products and services for home improvement, home
decor, home maintenance, home repair and remodeling, and maintenance of
commercial buildings.  As of February 1, 2002, Lowe's operated 744 stores in
42 states, with approximately 80.7 million square feet of retail selling
space.

     Lowe's was incorporated in North Carolina in 1952 and has been a publicly
held company since 1961.  Lowe's common stock is listed on the New York
Stock Exchange, with shares trading under the ticker symbol "LOW." Lowe's
general offices are located in Wilkesboro, North Carolina.

     Lowe's has one reportable industry segment - the operation of home
improvement retail stores.  See Item 6 "Selected Financial Data" for the
historical data of revenues, profits and identifiable assets of the Company.

Store Expansion

     Lowe's is continuing to maintain an aggressive growth strategy.  Lowe's
current prototype store has a 121,000 square foot sales floor with an
attached lawn and garden center comprising approximately 30,000 additional
square feet.  Lowe's 2002 expansion plan calls for opening approximately 123
stores (including the relocation of approximately 8 smaller format stores).
The Company is focusing much of its future expansion on metro markets with
populations of 500,000 or more.  Stores in these larger markets made up
approximately 65% of the total expansion in 2001 and will comprise a similar
percentage of growth in 2002.  The following table illustrates the growth of
the Company over the last three years.

Customer Service

     Lowe's serves both retail and commercial business customers.  Retail
customers are primarily do-it-yourself homeowners and others buying for
personal and family use.  Commercial business customers include repair and
remodeling contractors, electricians, landscapers, painters, plumbers and
commercial and residential building maintenance professionals.  Each Lowe's
store caters to these customers by combining the merchandise, sales and
service of: a home fashions and interior design center; a lawn and garden
center; an appliance dealer; a hard goods discounter; a hardware store; an
air conditioning, heating, plumbing and electrical supply center; and a
building materials supplier.

     Lowe's offers two proprietary credit cards - one for individual retail
customers and the other for commercial business customers.  Lowe's
commercial business customers can also make purchases on credit by using
Lowe's in-house accounts.  In addition, Lowe's accepts Visa, MasterCard,
Discover and American Express credit cards.

Products

     A typical Lowe's home improvement warehouse stocks more than 40,000
items, with hundreds of thousands of items available through our special
order system.  Each store carries a wide selection of nationally advertised
brand name merchandise. The Company's merchandise selection supplies both
the DIY retail and commercial business customer with items needed to
complete home improvement, repair, maintenance or construction projects.
See Note 15 on page 38 of the Annual Report to Security Holders for fiscal
year ended February 1, 2002 for the table illustrating sales by product
category for each of the last three fiscal years.

     Excluding special order vendors, the Company sources its products from
approximately 7,000 merchandise vendors worldwide, with no single vendor
accounting for more than 4% of total purchases.  The Company is not
dependent upon any single vendor.  To the extent possible, the Company
utilizes its Global Sourcing Division to purchase directly from foreign
manufacturers and avoid third party importers.  Management believes that
alternative and competitive suppliers are available for virtually all its
products, further increasing opportunities for product quality and operating
margins.  Lowe's has begun to cultivate and execute vendor alliance
partnerships with key vendor partners in an effort to enhance our market
share where such partnerships are advantageous to the customer, Lowe's and
the vendors.

     In order to maintain appropriate inventory levels in stores and to
improve distribution efficiencies, the Company operates seven highly
automated regional distribution centers (RDC's).  The current RDC's are
strategically located in North Carolina, Georgia, Indiana, Pennsylvania,
Texas, California and Ohio.  Each Lowe's store is served by one of these
RDC's.  The Company also operates nine smaller support facilities in order
to distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type
of packaging, such as lumber, various imports and building materials.
Approximately 50% of the merchandise purchased by the Company is shipped
through its distribution facilities, while the remaining portion is shipped
directly to stores from vendors.  Regional distribution centers are
currently under construction in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and in Northampton
County, North Carolina.

Marketing

     The Company reaches target customers through a mixture of television,
radio, direct mail, newspaper, event sponsorships, and in-store programs.
Each marketing initiative is based on understanding current and prospective
customers.  The Company has a strategic alliance with the HGTV network that
allows it to utilize a substantial portion of the commercial airtime in which
only the Company's and its vendors' commercials are aired.  This is one of a
half dozen media partnership programs which the Company employs in an effort
to build the image and equity of the Lowe's brand, while complementing the
core media and marketing programs.  Additionally, the Company hosts customer
hospitality events through its Team 48 NASCAR sponsorship, supports the wide-
ranging activities of Lowe's Home Safety Council, and utilizes its proprietary
credit programs to drive customer traffic and purchases.

     In 2001, the Company continued to introduce or redefine programs to
respond to the changing needs and lifestyles of targeted customers.  Primary
to this effort is the Company's initiative to serve commercial business
customers.  The Company has responded to the special needs of this customer
group by carrying more professional brands, increasing in-stock quantities for
bigger jobs and testing various marketing approaches in an effort to win the
loyalty of commercial customers.  The Company continues to emphasize installed
sales and currently has thirty product categories available where customers
can have installation arranged through Lowe's stores.  In addition, kiosks are
available in departments such as appliances, home decor/flooring,
electrical/lighting, millwork, hardware, seasonal, plumbing and tools for our
customer's special product ordering.  Some of these kiosks are technology
based and some are literature based, but all facilitate the ability of the
customer to special order to fit their home improvement needs.


Competition

     The home improvement retailing business is highly competitive. The
principal competitive factors are price, location, customer service, product
and brand selection, and name recognition.  The Company competes with a number
of traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical and home supply retailers, as
well as other chains of warehouse home improvement stores and lumber yards in
most of its market areas. In addition, the Company competes, with respect to
some of its products, with discount stores, mail order firms, and warehouse
clubs.

     Lowe's is the second largest retailer of home improvement products in the
world.  Due to the large number and variety of competitors, management is
unable to precisely measure the Company's market share in its existing market
areas.  However, Lowe's defines the market segments that it serves as DIY,
appliances, lawn & garden, home decor, repair/remodeling, specialty trade
contractor, and property management.  This total market is estimated to be
$400 billion of which Lowe's share is estimated to be approximately 6% as of
February 1, 2002.

Information Systems

     The Company is continuously assessing and upgrading its information
systems in an effort to support growth, to control costs, and to enable better
decision-making.  During the last six years, the Company has made a
substantial investment in developing and purchasing new computer systems.
Lowe's has a point of sale system, electronic bar code scanning system,
various design systems and dual UNIX Servers in each of its stores.  Store
information is communicated to the support center's central computer via a
terrestrial based (frame relay) network with back up being provided by a
satellite based wide area network.  These systems provide customer checkout
with automated credit card approval and also provide store-based perpetual
inventory information.  In addition, the systems also provide labor planning
and item movement experience.  These computers supply the general office
functions with the information needed to support the stores, including
centralized inventory replenishment.

Employees

     As of February 1, 2002, the Company employed approximately 87,000 full-
time and 21,000 part-time employees, none of which are covered by any
collective bargaining agreements.  Management considers its relations with its
employees to be good.


Item 2 - Properties

     At February 1, 2002, the Company operated 744 stores with a total of 80.7
million square feet of selling space. The current prototype large store is a
121,000 square foot sales floor with a lawn and garden center comprising
approximately 30,000 additional square feet.  Of the total stores operating at
February 1, 2002, approximately 70% of the facilities are owned, with the
remainder being leased.  Approximately 45% of these leases are capital leases.
The Company also owns and operates seven regional distribution centers and
nine smaller support facilities, four of which are reload centers for lumber
and building commodities.  The Company's general offices are located in
Wilkesboro, North Carolina and occupy several buildings, the majority of which
are owned.





Item 3 - Legal Proceedings

     The Company is a defendant in legal proceedings considered to be in the
normal course of business, none of which, singularly or collectively, are
considered material to the Company.


Item 4 - 	Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

         Not applicable.
