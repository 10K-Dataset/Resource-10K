Who
        We Serve

We
        serve
        homeowners, renters and Commercial Business Customers. Homeowner and renter
        customers primarily consist of do-it-yourselfers, those taking advantage
        of our
        installed sales programs, and others buying for personal and family use.

        meet
        customers’ varying needs, we combine merchandise sales and service in categories
        that are relevant to them. Our stores feature a home fashions and interior
        design center; a lawn and garden center; an appliance department; an outdoor
        power equipment department; an outdoor grill and patio furniture specialty

        supply center; a lumber and building materials center.

        Stores

New
        Store Expansion

Our
        expansion strategy led to the opening of 150 stores in fiscal 2005 that
        included two primary prototypes:

a
        116,000-square-foot (116K) store for large markets and a 94,000-square-foot
        (94K) store to serve smaller markets. In fiscal 2006, we estimate that
        approximately 80% of our growth will be comprised of 116K or 117,000-square-foot
        (117K) stores in larger markets and approximately 20% of our growth will
        be
        comprised of 94K stores in smaller markets.

Expansion
        into Canada

In
        June
        of 2005, we announced expansion plans into Canada. Based on information obtained
        through a thorough market assessment, we will adapt our U.S. business model
        to
        best meet the unique needs and attributes of the Canadian market. The market
        assessment included evaluating the buying habits of Canadian consumers, real
        estate opportunities, regulatory mandates, cultural differences, climate,
        and
        many other factors. Initially, plans are to open six to 10 stores in the
        Greater
        Toronto Area in 2007.

Investments
        in Existing Stores

During
        fiscal 2005, we continued our long history of investing in our existing stores
        to create a more inviting shopping experience for our retail and Commercial
        Business Customers. This included relamping our stores at regular intervals
        to
        ensure they remain bright, adding new displays, improving point-of-sale and
        directional signage, adding more product selection, repainting our building
        exteriors, and re-striping our parking lots. Additionally, our significant
        investment in bilingual signage and point-of-purchase materials continues
        to
        attract and retain the growing population of multicultural customers. We
        categorize our merchandising-related investments in our stores as
        follows:


Minor
        Resets

Minor
        resets are necessary to drive comparable store sales increases and keep our
        stores fresh with new and innovative products. These resets involve the
        replacement of a particular product or vendor and do not require major changes
        in the store. We conducted hundreds of minor resets in 2005.

Remerchandising

In
        we completed the remerchandising of 179 of our earlier format stores to make
        them more closely resemble our most current store prototypes. These
        remerchandising efforts focused on moving entire departments, improving
        adjacencies, and enhancing the shoppability within the cabinetry, appliances,
        paint, fashion plumbing, and flooring departments. All new interior graphics,
        signage, and way-finding materials were also added to increase shoppability
        and
        brighten the atmosphere. We were able to remerchandise these stores with
        minimal
        disruption to our customers. We continuously make these investments to maintain
        our best-in-class stores. These enhancements enable our stores to continue
        to
        deliver the sales performance we expect, and also offer our customers the
        shopping experience and environment they deserve.

Serving
        Our Customers

Our
        vision is to be our customers’ first choice for home improvement. To achieve
        this vision, we continue to focus on excellent customer service, Everyday
        Low
        Prices, and innovative operational, merchandising, marketing and distribution
        strategies. We believe customers’ perceptions of the quality of service
        determine a retailer’s success or failure. Therefore, we are always looking for
        ways to improve our level of service, optimize store labor and drive in-store
        process improvement, build our talent pool, and enhance our sales culture.
        The
        following are several key initiatives that we believe will continue to support
        our growth and success going forward.

Special
        Order Sales (SOS)

Our
        special order product offering provides our customers the opportunity to
        select
        unique and expressive products beyond the approximately 40,000 we carry in
        our
        stores. We are making the SOS process easier for our customers by enhancing
        ordering systems storewide, providing easy-to-use customer interfaces,
        integrated design tools and electronic product catalogs.

Special
        order kiosks are available in departments such as appliances, walls &
windows, fashion lighting, millwork, hardware, seasonal living, fashion plumbing
        and tools for facilitating special orders in addition to what is made available
        on Lowes.com.

Whether
        t

hese
        kiosks are electronic or

literature-

based,
        all facilitate the ability of the customer to special order.

Our
        SOS
        Express initiative for fashion plumbing is an example where advances in
        technology have improved the product selection and order entry process and
        helped expedite delivery, all of which make the special order process much
        more
        customer-friendly. A centrally located distribution center ensures that delivery
        is available in three business days for most items. An overnight delivery
        option
        is available for select items. We plan to roll this integrated process out
        to
        other categories in the future.

Installed
        Sales

We
        offer
        installation services in over 40 categories with

flooring,
        millwork and kitchen cabinets & countertops generating the highest sales.
        Our Installed Sales model, which includes the separation of selling and
        administrative tasks, allows our sales associates to shift their focus to
        project selling, while project managers ensure that the details related to
        an
        installation job are efficiently executed. Installed Sales, which include
        both
        product and labor, have proven to be a successful service initiative accounting
        for approximately 6% of total sales in fiscal 2005.

Commercial
        Business Customer Initiatives

We
        continue to improve service to our Commercial Business Customers on many
        different fronts. Because time is money for this important customer base,
        we
        tailor our product and service offerings so that they can find what they
        want
        when they want it. For example, we stock contractor packs, which are economical
        quantities of the items Commercial Business Customers use most. Commercial
        Business Customers can phone or fax their order in advance and it will be
        ready
        for pickup the same day or the next day depending on the time of day the
        order
        is placed. For added convenience, we can deliver to

job

sites,
        seven days a week in most areas. LowesForPros.com features articles, job
        estimate and business forms, e-newsletters, statistics and other vital
        information that Commercial Business Customers can use in their
        business.

Credit
        Financing

We
        offer
        a proprietary credit card for individual retail customers. We also offer
        a
        co-branded Visa® credit card to selected retail customers through direct mail
        offers. At the end of 2005, we launched Lowe’s Project Card in select stores.
        Lowe’s Project Card provides a major project, in-store financing solution to
        complement our Lowe’s Customer Revolving Credit Card. Lowe’s Project Card
        provides consumers an APR as low as 7.99% (ranging from 7.99% to 17.99%),
        credit
        lines up to $30K with repayment terms from 48 months to 120 months, and low
        fixed monthly payments. A project window allows customers to purchase with
        no
        payments or interest accrual for a six-month period after the first
        purchase.


We
        feature proprietary credit programs for Commercial Business Customers. These
        programs include a Lowe’s Business Account, which is ideal for small- to
        medium-size businesses and offers minimum monthly payments; and Lowe’s Accounts
        Receivable, which is ideal for medium- to large-size businesses that pay
        in full
        each month.

In
        addition, we accept Visa®, MasterCard®, Discover® and American Express® credit
        cards, as well as debit cards.

Everyday
        Low Prices

Our
        customers do not have to wait for a sale to find a great value. We offer
        low
        prices every day. Our promise to our customers is that if they find a lower
        everyday or advertised price on an identical stock product at a local
        competitor, we will not only match that price, but we will beat it by 10%.

Self-Checkout

To
        meet
        customer expectations for convenience at all levels of the shopping experience,
        we have self-checkout in 123 of our stores. All product types and quantities
        are
        permitted, most tender types are accepted and the customer interface is
        bilingual. Our plan for 2006 is to add self-checkout to over 300 additional
        stores.

Our
        Products

A
        typical
        Lowe's home improvement store stocks approximately 40,000 items,

with
        hundreds of thousands of

items
        available through our Special Order Sales system. Each store carries a wide
        selection of national brand name merchandise such as Whirlpool®, KitchenAid®,
        Samsung, Pella®, Werner®, Kohler®, DeWalt®, John Deere, Troy-Bilt®, Jenn-Air®,

ClosetMaid

®

and
        many

more.
        Our merchandise selection provides the DIY retail, DIFM and Commercial Business
        Customer a one-stop shop for products needed to complete home improvement,
        repair, maintenance or construction projects. See page 43 of Lowe’s 2005 Annual
        Report to Shareholders for the table summarizing sales by product category
        for
        each of the last three fiscal years.

Lowe’s
        Exclusives

In
        many
        product categories, customers look for a brand they know and trust to instill
        confidence in their purchase. To further differentiate our offering, we carry
        many brands that are exclusive to Lowe’s. These unique brands cover several
        categories like paint, lighting, flooring, doors, windows, tools

and
        more, and

give our
        customers superior performance and results. Exclusive brand names such as
        American Tradition®, Mohawk® Premier Living™, Kobalt®, Portfolio®, Harbor
        Breeze®,

Reliabilt®,
        Perfect Flame™ and

Top-Choice® Lumber are found only at Lowe’s.

We
        continue to cultivate and create strategic alliances with our vendor partners
        in
        an effort to enhance our market share where such partnerships are advantageous
        to the customer, our company and our vendors. We are also concentrating on
        increasing the electronic exchange of item and order information with our
        vendors, improving data integrity and reducing errors, leading to fewer returns
        and order changes and a better overall customer experience.

Product
        Sourcing

We
        source
        our products from approximately 7,000 merchandise vendors worldwide, with
        no
        single vendor accounting for more than six percent of total purchases.
        Management believes that alternative and competitive suppliers are available
        for
        virtually all our products. Where product specifications and customer
        preferences permit, our Global Sourcing Division purchases directly from
        foreign
        manufacturers, avoiding third-party importers. This provides savings for
        our
        customers and both brand building and gross margin improvement opportunities
        for
        Lowe’s.

Regional
        Distribution Centers (RDC)

To
        efficiently move product

from

our
        vendors to our stores and maintain in-stock levels, we own and operate 11,
        highly-automated RDCs. The RDCs are strategically located in North Carolina
        (2),
        Georgia (1), Indiana (1), Pennsylvania (1), Texas (1), California (1), Ohio
        (1),
        Florida (1), Connecticut (1), and Wyoming (1). Each RDC is capable of serving
        up
        to 140 of our stores.

We
        also
        own and

operate

        flatbed distribution centers and lease and operate two flatbed distribution
        centers to distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size
        or
        type of packaging such as lumber, boards, panel products, irrigation pipe,
        vinyl
        sidings, ladders and building materials. We also own and operate a facility
        to
        handle special order plumbing products, import products and internet
        fulfillment.

At
        the
        end of fiscal 2005, nearly 70% of the stock merchandise we purchase was shipped
        through our distribution network, while the remaining portion was shipped
        directly to stores from our vendors. As a part of our Rapid Response
        Replenishment (R3) initiative, we are increasing the shipments of product
        through our RDC network and increasing the frequency of RDC deliveries to
        our
        stores. Our R3 initiative allows us to move safety stock out of our stores
        and
        into our RDC network. By increasing the number of shipments to each store
        from
        our RDCs and reducing vendor-direct deliveries, we have enhanced our ability
        to
        quickly and efficiently flow product to stores in the quantities necessary
        to
        support demand.


Building
        Our Brand

Television,
        radio, newspaper, magazine, direct mail, sponsorships, Internet, and in-store
        programs all play a critical role in helping us reach our customers. Each
        marketing initiative is based on understanding customers in terms of
        demographics, needs, expectations, insights and beliefs as these relate to
        the
        home and home improvement.

Broadcast
        - Television, Radio

We
        continued to utilize national television to build brand awareness and
        positioning. We supplemented our national broadcast advertising in key markets
        with local television and radio.

National
        radio was used to support major promotional events throughout the year. We
        also
        continued to foster relationships with

network
        partners such as HGTV (Home and Garden Television).

Print
        - Newspaper, Magazine

We
        implemented an enhanced print plan in fiscal 2005 that included national
        magazine advertising and ROP (run of press) newspaper ads. Circulars remained
        a
        critical avenue for reaching our customers with our Everyday Low Price message
        and wide product and service selection.

Direct
        to Consumer

In
        fiscal
        2005, we continued to refine programs to respond to the changing needs and
        lifestyles of consumers. Through innovative database technology, we created
        relevant direct mail campaigns based on precise criteria such as purchase
        activity, affinity group memberships, new home purchase, household demographics
        and even regional weather patterns

.

Additionally,
        an opt-in e-mail program links up with Lowe’s affinity groups, including
        subscribers to our bi-monthly magazine

Creative
        Ideas

®,
        as
        well as members of Woodworkers Club and Garden Club. This fosters an ongoing
        relationship with customers even when they are not in a Lowe’s
        store.

Gift
        Cards

Consumers
        have adopted gift cards as a convenient way to make purchases. Lowe’s gift cards
        are no exception. We have expanded themed gift cards to include not only
        holidays and Team 48, but also gift cards tailored to college/university
        alumni
        and sports fans, including 95 team NCAA® gift cards. We also have several
        business-to-business gift card accounts so that companies can give Lowe’s gift
        cards as incentives and rewards.

Internet

Lowes.com
        is an information destination for customers all over the United States and
        the
        world. We redesigned the site in 2005 to better facilitate researching,
        comparing, and buying Lowe’s products and services. We remain committed to the
        Internet as a channel for future growth. We now have over 1,000 how-to guides
        and buying guides online to help customers make smarter, more informed buying
        decisions and to empower them in their home improvement projects. Awareness
        of
        Lowes.com was supplemented with a national advertising campaign on other
        web
        sites such as HGTV.com, Yahoo, AOL, and MSN.

Multicultural
        Marketing

We
        continued to produce marketing and communications designed to reach specific
        cultural segments of the population, including the growing number of Hispanic
        and African-American home improvement consumers. Print, direct mail,
        point-of-purchase materials and television are just a few of the channels
        through which we communicated with these consumer groups. To make shopping
        easier for our Hispanic customers, we continued to expand bilingual store
        signage.

At
        the
        end of fiscal 2005, nearly 62% of the stores had bilingual corporate way-finding
        signage.

Team
        Lowe’s Racing

As
        one of
        the world’s fastest growing sports, NASCAR is an important part of building our
        brand. We are the proud sponsor of the #48 car in the Nextel® Cup Series, the #5
        car in the Busch® Series, and Lowe’s Motor Speedway. We also host hospitality
        events at various sites throughout the racing season, leveraging and further
        building membership in the Team Lowe’s Racing Fan Club. In 2005, we continued to
        foster our relationship with Adrian Fernandez, who drove a second NASCAR
        Busch®
Series car for Lowe’s in select races. In 2006, we will team up with Adrian
        Fernandez and Fernandez Racing to field the #12 car in the 14-race Grand
        American Rolex Sports Car series.


Reaching
        Out

We
        believe community involvement extends beyond the boundaries of our stores.
        Following are some examples of how we are partnering with respected
        organizations to make a difference in communities and homes across
        America.

Habitat
        for

Humanity

Lowe’s
        is
        a national partner with Habitat for Humanity International, helping provide
        safe, affordable housing for thousands of working families. Lowe’s contributed
        more than $8 million to Habitat projects in 2005 and Lowe’s employee volunteers
        gave hands-on support at home sites coast-to-coast to help Habitat families
        build their dreams.

Lowe's
        is
        also the national underwriter of Habitat for Humanity's Women Build program,
        empowering women volunteer teams in the construction of Habitat homes. The
        volunteers in this program built approximately 250 homes in 2005.

When
        disasters struck around the globe, we assisted Habitat’s rebuilding efforts.
        Funds from Lowe’s, our customers and vendor partners, totaling $2 million, are
        assisting with the construction of approximately 1,200 homes in the region
        impacted by the December 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. Through Operation Home
        Delivery, Lowe’s contributed all building materials for the framing and
        finishing of 60 homes to kick-off Habitat’s long-term Gulf Coast rebuilding
        effort in the areas impacted by hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and also made
        a
        cash contribution of approximately $3 million to assist with those ongoing
        efforts.

American

Red
        Cross

As
        national Disaster Relief partner of the American Red Cross, we donate product
        to
        assist Red Cross chapters responding to disasters, partner with the organization
        on a Disaster Preparedness Guide distributed free through our stores, and
        support the organization’s Disaster Relief Fund. In 2005, Lowe’s Customer
        Donation Program to benefit the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund raised
        over $9 million, including a $2 million contribution from Lowe’s.

The
        Home Safety Council

Founded
        by Lowe's in 1993, The Home Safety Council is a nonprofit organization with
        a
        vision of creating safer American homes. In 2005, we, along with our vendors,
        helped reach thousands of children and families with vital safety
        information.

Lowe’s
        Charitable and Educational Foundation

Founded
        in 1957, the Lowe's Charitable and Educational Foundation (LCEF) has a long
        and
        proud history of contributing to grassroots community projects. LCEF's primary
        philanthropic focus areas include community and public school improvement
        projects, safe and affordable housing, and education scholarships. LCEF provides
        funding only to 501(c) (3) organizations in communities where we operate
        stores
        or distribution centers.

Lowe’s
        Heroes

Lowe's
        Heroes employee volunteers tackle local problems in their communities. In
        2005,
        Lowe’s stores worked with representatives from nonprofit organizations and
        concerned individuals from their communities to help improve schools, build
        Habitat for Humanity homes or address safety issues—making their communities
        better places to live.

Lowe’s
        Employee Relief Fund

Lowe's
        Employee Relief Fund is dedicated to distributing emergency funds to our
        employees who face financial hardships due to natural disasters, house fires
        or
        illness.

The
        company matches employee donations to the Fund.  In 2005, the Fund assisted
        more than 1,900 employees with funds totaling over $2 million.


Our
        Market

W

e
        estimate the size of the U.S. home improvement market to be approximately
        $700
        billion, $550 billion of which comprises product demand, and $150 billion
        for
        the installed labor opportunity.  Data from a variety of primary and
        secondary sources, including trade associations, government publications,
        industry participants and other sources was analyzed as the basis for our
        estimate. This estimate includes import and export data and key end-use markets,
        such as residential repair and remodeling, and nonresidential construction
        and
        maintenance.  This data also includes a wide range of categories relevant
        to our business, including major appliances and garden supplies.

As
        we
        continue to monitor economic data and the home improvement marketplace, there
        are many indicators demonstrating continued strength in consumer demand for
        the
        products and services we offer. The key indicators that we monitor include
        personal income, employment growth, housing turnover and home ownership levels.
        Demographic and societal trends also remain supportive of home improvement
        industry growth.

§

Personal
                income continues to grow, which is supported by data from the February
                2006 Blue Chip Economic Indicators™, which forecasts real disposable
                income growth of 3.4% for calendar 2006, compared with 1.4% in calendar
                2005.

§

Employment
                growth is a strong indicator of home improvement sales. The relatively
                low
                unemployment rate suggests Americans will likely be more confident
                in
                calendar 2006 about employment prospects than in the past several
                years.

§

Housing
                turnover is expected to continue at a historically high pace according
                to
                The National Association of Realtors

®

,
                which forecasts calendar 2006 housing turnover to be the third strongest
                year on record.

§

Near-record
                U.S. homeownership levels provide an established customer base for
                home
                maintenance and repair projects. The vast majority of our customers
                are
                homeowners and they are not willing to let what is often their most
                valuable financial asset deteriorate.

The
        home
        improvement retailing business includes many competitors. We compete with
        a
        number of traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical and home supply retailers,
        as well as other chains of warehouse home improvement stores and lumberyards
        in
        most of our market areas. In addition, we compete, with respect to some of
        our
        products, with discount stores, mail order firms and warehouse clubs. The
        principal competitive factors are customer service, location, price, product
        and
        brand selection, and name recognition.

Information
        Systems

We
        are
        continuously assessing and upgrading our information systems in an effort
        to
        support growth, augment new sales initiatives, control costs and enable better
        decision-making. During the last several years, we have made a substantial
        investment in developing and purchasing new computer systems.

We
        have a
        point-of-sale system, electronic bar code scanning system, various design
        systems, a wired and wireless network, and dual UNIX servers in each of our
        stores. These systems provide the stores with real-time perpetual inventory
        information, support all in-store selling functions, provide labor management
        functions, and provide support for a variety of store administrative functions.
        Store information is communicated to the customer support center's central
        computers via a terrestrial based (frame relay) network with back-up provided
        by
        a satellite-based wide area network. These systems provide customer checkout
        with automated credit card and check approval, host a variety of centralized
        design and specialty order systems for the stores, provide store-based perpetual
        inventory information, provide sales performance reporting, and support accurate
        processing of all store sales transactions. These computers supply the customer
        support center functions with the information needed to support the stores,
        including centralized inventory replenishment, financial systems, human
        resources, merchandising systems, and product information. In 2005, we moved
        the
        entire customer support center centralized data processing environment into
        a
        new corporate data center. This new center is a state-of-the-art facility
        providing many additional fail-safe features to improve system availability
        and
        mitigate risks associated with unplanned outages.

Employees

As
        of
        February 3, 2006, we employed approximately 144,000 full-time and 41,000
        part-time employees, none of which are covered by any collective bargaining
        agreements. Management considers its relations with its employees to be
        good.

Item
        1A. - Risk Factors

We
        are
        exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Most are general risks and
        uncertainties applicable to all retailers, but some are more particular to
        retailers serving the home improvement industry. Our operations may also
        be
        affected by factors that are either not currently known to us or which we
        currently consider immaterial to our business. We describe below some of
        the
        specific known factors that could negatively affect our business, financial
        condition and results of operations. All forward-looking statements made
        by us
        in this Annual Report to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K,
        in
        our Annual Report to Shareholders and in our subsequently filed quarterly
        and
        current reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as in
        our
        press releases and other public communications, are qualified by the risks
        described below.

Our
        sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general
        economy.

General
        economic factors and other conditions, both domestically and internationally,
        may adversely affect the United States, the global economy and our financial
        performance, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism, developments
        in
        the war against terrorism in Asia and the Middle East, natural disasters,
        increasing fuel and energy costs, inflation, recession, consumer debt levels
        and
        the volatility of financial markets.

Adverse
        changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may
        negatively impact the rate of growth of our net sales and comparable store
        sales.

Sales
        of
        many of our product categories and services are driven by activity level
        of home
        improvement projects. Many of those sales are to consumers who are either
        doing
        the home improvement projects themselves or using our installation services,
        but
        many others are to professionals who are in the business of providing
        construction, renovation, and property maintenance services. Spending on
        home
        improvement projects increased in 2005 but at a slower rate than in 2004.
        Rising
        interest-rates, reduction in the availability of credit, increased heating
        and
        gas expenses, and slowing home-price appreciation, could limit consumer’s
        discretionary spending and lead to reduced spending on home improvement
        projects. The impact of these economic factors specific to the home improvement
        industry would be exacerbated by a weak job market.

Unseasonable
        weather and adverse weather conditions can negatively affect our net sales
        and
        comparable store sales.

Wet
        and
        cold weather, particularly during the spring and early summer months of the
        year
        when many of the products we sell are designed for outdoor use, are generally
        detrimental to our sales and can make it difficult to sell seasonal merchandise
        inventory. Although the impact of adverse weather conditions is mitigated
        by the
        geographic dispersion of our stores, unseasonable weather is an ongoing,
        significant risk to the performance of our business.

Our
        store expansion and relocation strategy depends upon our ability to successfully
        open, relocate and operate new stores each year.

Our
        growth in net sales depends to a substantial degree on successfully and
        cost-effectively implementing our ongoing, aggressive expansion program.
        We must
        adapt our merchandising, marketing and distribution initiatives to new markets,
        both domestically and, going forward, in Canada. We must also increase the
        number of our stores in markets in which we currently operate. Our ability
        to
        open additional stores depends, in large measure, upon our ability to locate
        and
        acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local land use and other
        regulations restricting the construction of buildings in the formats with
        which
        we operate may affect our ability to open new stores in some markets. Increased
        real estate, construction and development costs could also limit our growth
        opportunities. Our ability to continue to expand our operations depends also
        on
        our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified
        employees. If we are unable to open new stores at the rate we currently plan
        to
        do so and staff them with qualified employees, the growth in our net sales
        and
        our competitive position could be adversely affected.


If
        we
        fail to hire, train and retain qualified managers, sales associates and other
        employees in our stores we could lose sales to our
        competitors.

Customers’
        perceptions of the quality of service provided by employees can determine
        any
        retailer’s success or failure. Competition for qualified store managers and
        sales associates among retailers in the home improvement retailing business
        is
        intense, and if we fail to attract, train and retain qualified managers and
        sales associates in our existing and new stores our financial performance
        could
        be adversely impacted. Consumers shopping for goods and services for home
        improvement projects expect to have sales associates serving them who are
        knowledgeable about product categories located throughout our stores.

Excessive
        turnover, which has historically been high among employees in entry-level
        or
        part-time positions, increases the risk that sales associates will not have
        the
        training and experience needed to provide competitive, high quality customer
        service.

Our
        Commercial Business Customers demand a higher level of customer service that
        is
        challenging to meet on a consistent basis.

Commercial
        Business Customers in the home improvement industry expect to have their
        business handled by commercial sales specialists with an even greater depth
        of
        knowledge about the products these customers need. If we fail to staff our
        commercial sales desks in our stores with experienced and knowledgeable
        employees who can satisfy their demands, we run the risk that we will lose
        Commercial Business Customers to our competitors.

We
        have many competitors, who, if we fail to execute our merchandising, marketing
        and distribution strategies effectively, could take sales and market share
        away
        from us.

We
        operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and
        services and have numerous large and small, direct and indirect competitors.
        The
        principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores,
        price
        and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment
        and
        presentation, and customer service. Our failure to respond effectively to
        competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could affect our
        financial performance. Moreover, unanticipated changes in the pricing and
        other
        practices of our competitors, including the effects of competitor liquidation
        activities, may impact our expected results.

An
        unusual number of product liability or breach of warranty claims for defective
        products could expose us to expensive claims and damage our standing with
        our
        customers.

We
        are
        exposed to product liability and product warranty claims relating to the
        products we sell that could adversely affect our financial condition, results
        of
        operations and cash flows. Because we do not have direct control over the
        quality of products manufactured or supplied to us by our vendors and because
        we
        self-insure for such product liability and warranty claims, we are exposed
        to
        risks relating to the quality of such products. Product liability claims
        can be
        expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other
        personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Claims
        of
        this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in the
        products we stock and sell and our reputation.

Our
        financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical
        information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted.

An
        important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies, cost reductions, and
        sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of
        improvements to our management information systems to improve operations
        such as
        inventory replenishment systems, merchandise ordering, transportation, and
        receipt processing. Our financial performance could be adversely affected
        if our
        management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to
        improve, upgrade, maintain, and expand our systems.

If
        the domestic and international supply chain for the products we stock and
        sell
        is disrupted, our net sales and comparable store sales would be adversely
        impacted.

We
        source
        the approximately 40,000 products we stock and sell from approximately 7,000
        domestic and international vendors. We source many of those products directly
        from foreign manufacturers. Political or financial instability among suppliers,
        trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates and transport capacity
        and
        costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if
        they
        seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply
        chain.

Our
        inability to effectively manage and expand our relationships with selected
        suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our ability to
        differentiate ourselves from our competitors.

Part
        of
        our expansion strategy includes continued differentiation from our competitors.
        To better distinguish our product offering, we form strategic relationships
        with
        selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized
        and respected brand names. The inability to effectively and efficiently manage
        the relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business
        plan
        and financial results.

At
        February 3, 2006, we operated 1,234 stores in 49 states with a total of 140
        million square feet of selling space. We are currently

constructing

two
        primary prototype stores, a 116K/117K store for larger markets and a 94K
        store
        used primarily to serve smaller markets. Both prototypes include a lawn and
        garden center, averaging an additional 31,000 square feet for 116K/117K
        locations and 26,000 square feet for 94K locations. Of the total stores
        operating at February 3, 2006, approximately 84% are owned, which includes
        stores on leased land, with the remainder being leased from unaffiliated
        third
        parties. Approximately 60% of these leases are capital leases. We also own
        and
        operate 11 regional distribution centers and 10 flatbed distribution centers
        for
        lumber and building commodities. We lease and operate another two flatbed
        distribution centers. We also operate a facility to handle special order
        plumbing products, import products and internet fulfillment. We own our
        executive offices, which are located in Mooresville, North Carolina. We also

Item
        9A - Controls and Procedures

The
        Company's management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer
        and
        Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s
“disclosure controls and procedures”, (as such term is defined in
        Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
        amended, (the “Exchange Act”)). Based upon their evaluation, the Chief Executive
        Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the
        period
        covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
        effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be
        disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange
        Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) (1) is recorded,
        processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
        SEC’s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to the
        Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial
        officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
        disclosure.

In
        addition, based on that evaluation, no change in the Company’s internal control
        over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal fourth quarter ended
        February 3, 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
        materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s
        report on internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined
        in
        Rules 13a - 15(f) and 15d - 15(f) under the Exchange Act) and the attestation
        report of Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public
        accounting firm, on management’s assessment of internal control over financial
        reporting are included in Lowe’s 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders on pages 26
        and 27 under the headings, “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
        Financial Reporting” and “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
        Firm,” respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
