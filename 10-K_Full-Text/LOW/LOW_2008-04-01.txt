General
Information

Lowe’s
Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a Fortune 50 company and the
world’s second largest home improvement retailer, with specific emphasis on
retail do-it-yourself (DIY) customers, do-it-for-me (DIFM) customers who utilize
our installation services, and Commercial Business Customers.  We
offer a complete line of products and services for home decorating, maintenance,
repair, remodeling, and property maintenance.  As of February 1, 2008,
we operated 1,534 stores in 50 states and Canada, with 174 million square feet
of retail selling space.

Incorporated
in North Carolina in 1952, Lowe’s Companies, Inc. has been publicly held since
1961. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange - ticker symbol
“LOW.”

See Item
6, “Selected Financial Data,” for historical revenues, profits and identifiable
assets.

Who
We Serve

We serve
homeowners, renters and Commercial Business Customers.  Homeowners and
renters primarily consist of do-it-yourselfers, those taking advantage of our
installed sales programs, and others buying for personal and family
use.  Commercial Business Customers include repair and remodeling
contractors, electricians, landscapers, painters, plumbers, and commercial and
residential property maintenance professionals, among others.

To meet
customers’ varying needs, we combine merchandise sales and service in categories
that are relevant to them.  We offer a full array of home improvement
products in the following categories: appliances, lumber, flooring, paint,
millwork, fashion plumbing, building materials, lighting, tools, lawn &
landscape products, hardware, seasonal living, cabinets & countertops, home
style & organization, rough plumbing, outdoor power equipment, nursery,
rough electrical and home environment.

Our
Market

Based on
the most recent comprehensive data available, which is from 2006, we estimate
the size of the U.S. home improvement market to be approximately $755 billion
annually, comprised of $585 billion of product demand and $170 billion of
installed labor opportunity.  Data from a variety of primary and secondary
sources, including trade associations, government publications, industry
participants and other sources was analyzed as the basis for our
estimate.  This data captures a wide range of categories relevant to
our business, including major appliances and garden supplies.

As we
continue to monitor economic data and the home improvement marketplace, there
are many variables that impact consumer demand for the products and
services we offer.  Key indicators we monitor include housing
turnover, home ownership levels, real disposable personal income and
employment.  We also monitor demographic and societal trends that are
indicators of home improvement industry growth.  Currently, all of
these indicators suggest continued weakness in consumer demand.

§

Housing
      turnover, which peaked in calendar year 2005, continues to slow
      according to The National Association of Realtors®.  Recent data
      suggests that 2008 will remain challenging for housing
      turnover.

§

According
      to the U.S. Census Bureau, while U.S. home ownership levels have
      declined somewhat from near-record levels over the past year, they remain
      above their historical average.  Home ownership provides an
      established customer base for home maintenance and repair
      projects.   The vast majority of our customers are
      homeowners and they are not willing to let what is often their most
      valuable financial asset
deteriorate.

§

Although
      real disposable personal income continues to grow, it is projected to grow
      at a slower pace this year than last.  Real disposable personal
      income growth is forecasted to be 2.1% for calendar 2008 compared with
      3.1% for calendar 2007, as supported by data from the March 2008 Blue Chip
      Economic Indicators™.

§

Employment
      is an indicator of home improvement sales.  The forecasted
      average unemployment rate of 5.3% for 2008 from the March 2008 Blue
      Chip Economic Indicators™ is higher than the 4.6% average seen in
      both 2006 and 2007 and suggests that Americans will face relatively less
      favorable employment prospects this
year.


The home
improvement retailing business includes many competitors.  We compete
with a number of traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical and home supply
retailers, as well as other chains of warehouse home improvement stores and
lumberyards in most of our trade areas.  In addition, we compete, with
respect to some of our products, with general merchandise stores, mail order
firms, warehouse clubs and online retailers.  The principal
competitive factors are customer service, location, price, product and brand
selection, and name recognition.

Our
Stores

New
Store Expansion

Our
expansion strategy led to the opening of 153 stores in fiscal 2007 (149 new and
four relocated) that included two primary prototypes: a 117,000-square-foot
(117K) store for large markets and a 94,000-square-foot (94K) store to serve
smaller markets.  As we continue our expansion and strive to maximize
our return on investment, we consider market demographics and land availability,
among other factors, to determine the appropriate prototype for a particular
market.  In fiscal 2008, our growth will be comprised of 94K,
103,000-square-foot and 117K stores to meet the specific needs of each
market.

International
Expansion

In June
2005, we announced expansion plans into Canada.  Based on information
obtained through a thorough market assessment, we are adapting our U.S. business
model to best meet the unique needs and attributes of the Canadian
market.  We opened six stores in Canada in fiscal 2007, which are
our first stores outside the U.S., and will continue our Canadian expansion in
2008.

In
January 2007, we announced expansion plans into Mexico.  We expect to
open our first stores in Monterrey in fiscal 2009.

Investments
in Existing Stores

During
fiscal 2007, we continued our long history of investing in our existing stores
to enhance the shopping experience for our retail and Commercial Business
Customers.  This included relamping our stores at regular intervals to
ensure they remained bright, adding new displays, improving point-of-sale and
directional signage, adding more product selection, repainting our building
exteriors, and re-striping our parking lots.  We categorize our
merchandising-related investments in our stores as resets or
remerchandising.

Resets

Resets
are necessary to drive comparable store sales and keep our stores fresh with new
and innovative products.  These resets involve the replacement of a
particular product or vendor, and generally do not require major changes in the
store.  We conducted hundreds of resets in fiscal 2007.

Remerchandising

In fiscal
2007, we completed the remerchandising of 116 of our earlier format stores to
make them more closely resemble our most current store
prototypes.  These remerchandising efforts focused on moving entire
departments, improving adjacencies and enhancing the shopability within the
appliances, cabinets & countertops, flooring, fashion plumbing, paint,
lighting, home style & organization, lumber and building materials
departments.  In addition, we replaced or refurbished all of our
selling centers, including the returns and customer service areas of these
stores.  All new interior graphics, signage, and way-finding materials
were also added to increase shopability and brighten the
atmosphere.  Finally, self check-out was installed in all 116 of our
remerchandised stores.  We continuously make these investments to
maintain our best-in-class stores.  These enhancements enable our
stores to continue to offer customers the shopping experience and environment
they deserve, and also deliver stronger sales.


Serving
Our Customers

Our
vision is to be our customers’ first choice for home improvement.  To
achieve this vision, we continue to focus on excellent customer service,
Everyday Low Prices, and innovative operational, merchandising, marketing and
distribution strategies.  We believe customers’ perceptions of the
quality of service determine a retailer’s success or
failure.  Therefore, we are always looking for ways to improve our
level of service, optimize store labor and drive in-store process improvement,
build our talent pool, and enhance our sales culture.  The following
are several key initiatives we believe will continue to support our growth and
success going forward.

Everyday
Low Prices

Our
customers do not have to wait for a sale to find a great value.  We
offer low prices every day.  Our promise to customers is that if they
find a lower everyday or advertised price on an identical stock product at a
local competitor, we will not just match that price, but we will beat it by
10%.

Specialty
Sales

We
recognize the opportunity that our Specialty Sales initiatives represent and the
importance of these businesses to our long-term growth.  Our Specialty
Sales initiatives include three major categories: Installed Sales, Special Order
Sales and Commercial Business Customer sales, internally referred to as the “Big
3.”  In addition, our effort to utilize e-Commerce to drive sales and
conveniently provide product information to customers is managed by our
Specialty Sales group.

Installed
Sales

We offer
installation services in over 40 categories with flooring, millwork and cabinets
& countertops generating the highest sales.  Our Installed Sales
model, which includes the separation of selling and administrative tasks, allows
our sales associates to shift their focus to project selling, while project
managers ensure that the details related to an installation job are efficiently
executed.  Installed Sales, which includes both product and labor, has
proven to be a successful service initiative accounting for approximately 6% of
total sales in fiscal 2007.  We also continue to refine our offerings,
including an ongoing test of an in-home selling model for certain Installed
Sales categories.

Special
Order Sales

Our
Special Order Sales product offerings provide our customers the opportunity to
select a wider assortment of product options beyond the approximately 40,000 we
carry in our stores.  We are making the Special Order
Sales process easier for customers by providing more product displays and
electronic product catalogs in our stores, as well as on
Lowes.com.  We continue to enhance integrated design tools and
ordering systems storewide in order for customers to envision projects, as well
as to efficiently receive quotations and complete an order.

Special
Order kiosks, whether electronic or literature-based, are available in various
departments throughout the store for facilitating special orders in addition to
what is made available on Lowes.com.  These kiosks facilitate the
ability of customers to view product pictures, and special order hundreds of
thousands of products.

Our
Special Order Express initiative is intended to allow for faster and more
efficient delivery of Special Order products to customers, while at the same
time manage our inventory investment.  Under this approach, certain
items that do not have enough individual store demand to be economically stocked
in all stores, but have sizeable demand across a group of stores, will be kept
on hand in our distribution centers.  This allows for fast shipment to
our stores, or in some cases, direct shipment to a customer’s
home.  Our Special Order Express initiative allows us to balance
quickly satisfying customers’ needs with a desire to minimize our inventory
investment.  We will continue to refine and enhance this initiative in
fiscal 2008.

Commercial
Business Customers

Growth in
total sales to Commercial Business Customers outpaced the Company average in
fiscal 2007.  Our focus is to continue offering exceptional service to
repair/remodel, residential property management, and business maintenance
customers.  Because we understand that time is money for these
businesses, we continue to focus on ways to tailor our product and service
offerings for these customers to quickly find what they need, when they need
it.

In order
to enable Commercial Business Customers to quickly access the products they
need, our stores are merchandised with high-volume, take-with product
appropriate for the season.  We continue to evaluate and expand our
contractor packs, which are economical quantities of the items Commercial
Business Customers use most.  In addition, Commercial Business
Customers can phone or fax their orders in advance or order online for
pickup the same day or the next day, depending on the time of day the order is
placed. For added convenience, we deliver to job sites seven days a week in most
areas. We want to be a valued business partner to Commercial Business Customers,
so we ensure our LowesForPros.com site features up-to-date articles, job
estimators and business forms, e-newsletters, statistics and other vital
information that Commercial Business Customers can use for their
business.


e-Commerce

Our
multi-channel capabilities enable customers to buy at the store or
online.  Lowes.com is an information destination for customers around
the world and allows customers to buy online and ship anywhere in the
U.S.  Our site facilitates customers researching, comparing and buying
Lowe’s products and services whenever and from wherever they
desire.  We offer how-to and buying guides online to help customers
make smarter, more informed buying decisions and to empower them in their home
improvement projects.  We also offer customers the ability to check
product availability at their local store and our direct-ship facilities, and
offer store pick-up and hassle-free returns regardless of where the product was
purchased.  As more and more people are using the internet to research
the products they want, we continue to add content to our site and enhance our
merchandise selection to meet their needs.

Credit
Financing

We offer
a proprietary credit card for retail customers.  In addition, we offer
a Lowe’s Project Card in all stores.  Lowe’s Project Card provides a
major project, in-store financing solution to complement our Lowe’s Customer
Revolving Credit Card.

We also
offer proprietary credit programs for Commercial Business
Customers.  They include a Lowe’s Business Account, which is ideal for
small- to medium-size businesses and offers minimum monthly payments, and Lowe’s
Accounts Receivable, which is ideal for medium- to large-size businesses that
pay in full each month.

See Item
8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for a description of our
credit programs.

In
addition, we accept Visa®, MasterCard®, Discover® and American Express® credit
cards, as well as debit cards from all major networks.

Our
Products

Product
Sourcing

We source
our products from approximately 7,000 merchandise vendors worldwide, with no
single vendor accounting for more than six percent of total
purchases.  Management believes that alternative and competitive
suppliers are available for virtually all our products.  Whenever
possible, we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings for our
customers and gross margin improvement for Lowe’s.

In
addition to offering a wide selection of national brand name merchandise, we are
committed to building long-term value for Lowe’s through the development of
exclusive, proprietary brands where we focus on delivering the best quality, the
best value and recognizably differentiated products to meet our customers’ needs
and wants.

National
Brand Name Merchandise

In many
product categories, customers look for a brand they know and trust to instill
confidence in their purchase.  A typical Lowe's home improvement store
stocks approximately 40,000 items, with hundreds of thousands of items available
through our Special Order Sales system.  Each store carries a wide
selection of national brand name merchandise such as KitchenAid®, Samsung,
Whirlpool®, Pella®, Werner®, Kohler®, DeWalt®, John Deere, Troy-Bilt®,
Jenn-Air®, Bosch®, Valspar®, Owens Corning® and many more.  Our
merchandise selection provides the DIY, DIFM and Commercial Business Customer a
one-stop shop for products needed to complete home improvement, repair,
maintenance or construction projects.  See page 42 of Lowe’s 2007
Annual Report to Shareholders for the table summarizing sales by product
category for each of the last three fiscal years.

Proprietary
Brands

To
further differentiate our offering, we carry many brands that are exclusive to
Lowe’s.  These unique brands cover several categories like lighting,
flooring, home style & organization, tools and more, and give our customers
great quality and value. Exclusive brand names such as Premier Living™, Kobalt®,
Portfolio®, Harbor Breeze®, Reliabilt®, Perfect Flame™, Top-Choice® Lumber and
Utilitech™ are found only at Lowe’s.

Distribution
Network

To
efficiently move product from our vendors to our stores and maintain in-stock
levels, we own and operate 13 highly-automated regional distribution centers
(RDCs).  The RDCs are strategically located in North Carolina (2),
Georgia, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Texas, California, Ohio, Florida, Connecticut,
Wyoming, Illinois and Oregon.  On average, each RDC serves 118
stores.  We expect to open an additional RDC in Pittston, Pennsylvania
in fiscal 2008.  We also lease a third-party distribution facility to
serve our Canadian stores.

We
operate 14 flatbed distribution centers (FDCs) to distribute merchandise that
requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber,
boards, panel products, irrigation pipe, vinyl sidings, ladders and building
materials.  We own 12 and lease two of these FDCs.  We
expect to open an additional FDC in Purvis, Mississippi in fiscal
2008.

We also
operate four facilities to support our import business, Special Order Sales and
internet fulfillment.  We own two and lease two


of these
facilities.  In addition, we utilize three third-party transload
facilities.  These facilities do not hold inventory, but are the first
point of receipt for imported products.  The transload facilities sort
and allocate products to RDCs based on individual store demand and
forecasts.

On
average in fiscal 2007, over 72% of the stock merchandise we purchased was
shipped through our distribution network, while the remaining portion was
shipped directly to stores from our vendors.

Building
Our Brand

Customers
want Lowe’s to serve as a resource for products and projects to help them
maintain and enhance their homes and communities.  Our Marketing and
Advertising programs, communicated via television, radio, newspaper, magazine,
direct mail, sponsorships, internet and in-store programs, all play a critical
role in cultivating this emotional and rational connection with the consumer.
Through an extensive understanding of our customers and their needs and
expectations, we deliver a message that will develop loyal customer
relationships and differentiate Lowe’s from other home improvement
sources.

Media
Investment

A
combination of national broadcast and cable television, supplemented by an array
of national magazines and internet banner advertising, provides the platform for
building brand awareness. We complement the national media investment in
key markets by local television and radio schedules. Newspaper circulars and ROP
(Run of Press) serve as the primary communication vehicle for retail messaging,
and regularly feature Lowe’s breadth of product selection, customer services and
Everyday Low Price positioning. Major promotional events receive network radio
support with a local radio overlay in key markets.  We promote internet
access to Lowe’s retail advertising through the use of online banner
advertising. The Lowe’s brand has also been successfully integrated into
television programming, including the Oprah Winfrey show, Rate My Space on HGTV
and Indoors Out on the DIY network.

Direct
to Consumer Marketing

We
continue to refine programs to respond to the changing needs and lifestyles of
consumers.  Through innovative database technology, we create direct mail
campaigns based on precise criteria such as purchase activity, affinity group
subscription(s), household demographics, regional weather patterns and even
consumers who are preparing to move, are in the process of moving or have
recently moved into a new home (“New Movers”).  Despite the housing
slow-down, New Movers continue to spend considerably more on their previous and
new homes than the average homeowner.  This behavior has helped guide the
decision to further invest in this particular consumer base over the course of
the next several years. As a result, Lowe’s has finalized a two-year agreement
with the United States Postal Service’s change of address program and will add
this to its multi-dimensional portfolio of direct mail tactics that speak to the
highly engaged New Movers. Additionally, opt-in e-mail programs line up with
Lowe’s affinity and education programs:  Lowe’s Creative Ideas for Home and
Garden ®, Lowe’s Creative Ideas for Outdoor Living ™ and Lowe’s Creative Ideas
for Woodworkers ™.  Membership in the Team Lowe’s Racing Fan Club and
participation in the Build-n-Grow children’s clinics creates another level
of engagement with our consumers both inside Lowe’s stores and beyond our
walls.   Each of these varying acquisition and retention programs
creates loyal Lowe’s customers.

Multicultural
Marketing

Lowe’s
reaches its diverse communities and customer base in various manners, including
multicultural marketing and outreach to Hispanic, African-American and Asian
customers.  For these cultural groups, Lowe’s executes advertising across
many media, including television, radio and print, in both English and native
languages.  Some of the unique efforts include La Cancha Lowe’s, Lowe’s
Hispanic mobile marketing program providing fun to families at key soccer events
across the country; Lowe’s sponsorship of the CIAA’s annual Basketball
Tournament, the nation’s oldest black athletic conference consisting of ten
historically African-American institutions of higher education, that has
blossomed into one of largest collegiate post-season tournaments in the country;
and Lowe’s new Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese language websites offering a new
way for many Asian consumers to learn more about home improvement.

Team
Lowe’s Racing

As one of
the world’s fastest growing sports, NASCAR is an important part of building our
brand. We are the proud sponsor of Jimmie Johnson, back-to-back NASCAR Sprint®
Cup Series champion, the #48 car and Lowe’s Motor Speedway.  We also
host hospitality events at various sites throughout the racing season,
leveraging and further building membership in the Team Lowe’s Racing Fan
Club.  In 2007, we continued to foster our relationship with Adrian
Fernandez, who drove in the NASCAR Busch® Series race in Mexico City for
Lowe’s.  In addition, we teamed up with Adrian Fernandez and Fernandez
Racing to field the #15 car in the American Le Mans Series.

Reaching
Out

We
believe community involvement extends beyond the boundaries of our
stores.  Following are some examples of how we are partnering with
respected organizations to make a difference in our communities:


Habitat
for Humanity

Lowe’s is
a partner with Habitat for Humanity International, helping provide safe,
affordable housing for thousands of working families.  Lowe’s
contributed more than $4 million to Habitat projects in 2007, and Lowe’s
employee volunteers gave hands-on support at home sites coast-to-coast to help
Habitat families build their dreams.

Lowe’s
also underwrites Habitat for Humanity’s Women Build program, empowering women
volunteer teams to construct Habitat homes.  The volunteers in this
program built more than 90 homes in 2007.

American
Red Cross

As a
national disaster relief partner with the American Red Cross, Lowe’s made it
easier for Red Cross chapters to respond to disasters such as fires, floods and
tornadoes with much-needed supplies from local stores.  We also worked
side-by-side with the American Red Cross at hurricane fairs along the Gulf and
East coasts.  In 2007, Lowe’s contributed more than $500,000 to the
American Red Cross, including customer and employee donations.

The
Home Safety Council

Founded
by Lowe’s in 1993, The Home Safety Council is a nonprofit organization with a
vision of creating safer American homes.  Thanks to a $3 million
contribution in 2007 from the Lowe’s Charitable and Educational Foundation, The
Home Safety Council helped reach thousands of children and families with vital
safety information.

Lowe’s
Charitable and Educational Foundation

Founded
in 1957, the Lowe's Charitable and Educational Foundation (LCEF) has a long and
proud history of contributing to grassroots community
projects.  LCEF’s primary philanthropic focus areas include community
and public school improvement projects, safe and affordable housing, and
education scholarships. LCEF provides funding only to 501(c)(3)
organizations.  In 2007, LCEF awarded more than $19 million in
grants.  Two specific initiatives of LCEF during 2007 were SkillsUSA
and Rebuilding Together.

In 2007,
Lowe’s took steps through LCEF to address the country’s growing skilled worker
shortage and “skills gap” by contributing $500,000 to SkillsUSA programs
nationwide.  Thirty grants in 21 states received the first
SkillsUSA/Lowe’s $10,000 education grants supporting education program
enhancements and community service projects.  Fifty-eight schools
received CareerSafe vouchers, demonstrating Lowe’s corporate commitment to job
site safety.  Lowe’s has increased our commitment to SkillsUSA with a
pledge of $1 million for 2008.

Lowe’s
lives up to its tagline, “Let’s Build Something Together,” every
day.  In 2007, LCEF launched a partnership with Rebuilding Together,
the nation’s largest all-volunteer home rehabilitation
organization.  Grants ranging from $15,000 to $20,000 kicked off
rehabilitation projects in Long Island, N.Y., Orange County, Calif., and Broward
County, Fla., and LCEF pledged another $1 million in grants to Rebuilding
Together affiliates.  Between fall 2007 and spring 2008, that $1
million was slated to finance at least 100 projects.

Lowe’s
Heroes

Lowe’s
Heroes employee volunteers tackle local problems in their
communities.  In 2007, Lowe’s stores worked with representatives from
nonprofit organizations and concerned individuals from their communities to help
improve schools, build Habitat for Humanity homes or address safety
issues—making their communities better places to live.

Lowe’s
Employee Relief Fund

Lowe’s
Employee Relief Fund is dedicated to distributing emergency funds to our
employees who face financial hardships due to natural disasters, house fires or
illness.  The Company matches employee donations to the Fund.
 Since 1999, Lowe’s Employee Relief Fund has assisted more than 5,300
employees with more than $6 million in funds.

Information
Systems

We are
continuously assessing and upgrading our information systems in an effort to
support growth, augment new sales initiatives, control costs and enable better
decision-making.  During the last several years, we have made
substantial investments in developing and purchasing new computer
systems.

We have a
point-of-sale system, electronic bar code scanning system, various design
systems, a wired and wireless network, and dual UNIX servers in each of our
stores.  These systems provide the stores with real-time perpetual
inventory information, support all in-store selling, support labor planning and
management, and provide support for a variety of store administrative
functions.  In addition, these store systems provide the customer
support center organizations with information needed to support the
stores.  Key customer support center groups using this information
include inventory replenishment, finance, human resources and
merchandising.  Store information is communicated to the customer
support center's central computers via a terrestrial based (MPLS) network with
back-up provided by a satellite-based wide area network.  These
corporate systems provide customer checkout with automated credit card
and


Index

check
approval, host a variety of centralized design and specialty order systems for
the stores, provide store-based perpetual inventory information, provide sales
performance reporting, and support accurate processing of store sales
transactions.  In addition to the store and corporate office computing
infrastructure, we also have significant computing capacity at each RDC to
support these highly automated facilities.

We have
invested significant resources to safeguard sensitive employee and customer
information.  We work closely with industry standards groups to
incorporate security best practices into our technology
environment.  Our two state-of-the-art data centers provide many
additional fail-safe features to improve system availability and mitigate risks
associated with unplanned outages.  Our second data center opened in
late 2007 and provides complete back-up to our primary facility.  With
these two facilities, the Company is well positioned for future
growth.

Employees

As of
February 1, 2008, we employed approximately 160,000 full-time and 56,000
part-time employees, none of which are covered by collective bargaining
agreements.  Management considers its relations with its employees to
be good.

Item 1A

– Risk Factors

We are
exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Most are general risks and
uncertainties applicable to all retailers, but some are more particular to
retailers serving the home improvement industry.   Our operations
may also be affected by factors that are either not currently known to us or
which we currently consider immaterial to our business.  We describe
below some of the specific known factors that could negatively affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.  All
forward-looking statements made by us in this Annual Report to the Securities
and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K, in our Annual Report to Shareholders and
in our subsequently filed quarterly and current reports to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, as well as in our press releases and other public
communications, are qualified by the risks described below.

Our
sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general
economy.

General
economic factors and other conditions, both domestically and internationally,
may adversely affect the United States economy, the global economy and our
financial performance.  These include, but are not limited to, periods
of flat economic growth or recession, volatility and/or lack of liquidity from
time to time in U.S. and world financial markets and the consequent reduced
availability and/or higher cost of credit to Lowe’s and its customers, slower
rates of growth in real disposable personal income, higher rates of
unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, increasing fuel and energy costs,
inflation or deflation of commodity prices, natural disasters, acts of terrorism
and developments in the war against terrorism in Asia and the Middle
East.

Adverse
changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may
negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable store
sales.

Sales of
many of our product categories and services are driven by housing turnover and
activity level of home improvement projects.  Many of those sales are
to consumers who are either doing the home improvement projects themselves or
using our installation services, but many others are to professionals who are in
the business of providing construction, renovation, and property maintenance
services.  Rising interest-rates on variable rate mortgages,
increasing mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates, reduction in the
availability of mortgage financing and consumer credit, lower housing turnover,
home-price depreciation and increased heating and gas expenses could limit
consumers’ discretionary spending and affect their confidence level and could
lead to further reduced spending on home improvement projects.  The
impact of these economic factors specific to the home improvement industry would
be exacerbated by a weak job market.

Unseasonable
weather conditions and adverse weather events can negatively affect our total
sales and comparable store sales.

If
weather conditions are uncharacteristic of the time of year during any season,
they can hurt our sales by making it difficult to sell seasonal
merchandise.  Although the impact of unseasonable weather conditions
is mitigated somewhat by the broad geographic dispersion of our stores, they
continue to be a significant risk to the overall performance of our business,
particularly when they occur


across a
broad region of the United States.  Adverse weather events, such as a
prolonged and widespread drought, can hurt our sales of particular products as
well.

Our
store expansion and relocation strategy depends upon our ability to successfully
open and operate new stores each year.

Our
growth in total sales depends to a substantial degree on successfully and
cost-effectively implementing our ongoing expansion program.  We must
adapt our merchandising, marketing and distribution initiatives to new markets
both domestically and as we continue to expand into Canada and
Mexico.   We also plan to increase the number of our stores in
markets in which we currently operate.  Our ability to open additional
stores depends, in large measure, upon our ability to locate and acquire new
store sites on acceptable terms.   Local land use and other
regulations restricting the construction of buildings in the formats with which
we operate may affect our ability to open new stores in some
markets.  As we develop more new stores in metropolitan markets, we
may incur increased costs to remediate environmental pollution on some of the
sites we are redeveloping that was caused by previous owners of those
sites.  Increased real estate, construction and development costs
could also limit our growth opportunities.  Our ability to continue to
expand our operations depends also on our ability to attract and retain a large
and growing number of qualified employees.  If we are unable to open
new stores at the rate we currently plan and staff them with qualified
employees, the growth in our sales and our competitive position could be
adversely affected.

If
we fail to hire, train and retain qualified managers, sales associates and other
employees we could lose sales to our competitors.

Customers’
perceptions of the quality of service provided by employees can determine any
retailer’s success or failure.  Competition for qualified store
managers and sales associates among retailers in the home improvement retailing
business is intense, and if we fail to attract, train and retain qualified
managers and sales associates our financial performance could be adversely
impacted.  Consumers shopping for goods and services for home
improvement projects expect to have sales associates serving them who are
knowledgeable about product categories located throughout our
stores.

Excessive
turnover, which has historically been high among employees in entry-level or
part-time positions, increases the risk that sales associates will not have the
training and experience needed to provide competitive, high quality customer
service.

Our
success in serving the needs of Commercial Business Customers is dependent upon
our ability to attract and retain qualified commercial sales
specialists.

Commercial
Business Customers in the home improvement industry require that we have
well-trained commercial sales specialists at our project desks.  By
doing so, we can better serve the needs of this customer on a consistent
basis.  Our commercial sales specialists have a great depth of
knowledge about the products needed by Commercial Business
Customers.  If we fail to staff our project desks with experienced and
knowledgeable employees, we run the risk that we will lose Commercial Business
Customers.

We
have many competitors, who, if we fail to execute our merchandising, marketing
and distribution strategies effectively, could take sales and market share from
us.

We
operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and
services and have numerous large and small, direct and indirect
competitors.  The principal competitive factors in our industry
include location of stores, price and quality of merchandise, in-stock
consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, and customer
service.  Our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures
and changes in the retail markets could affect our financial
performance.  Moreover, unanticipated changes in the pricing and other
practices of our competitors, including the effects of competitor liquidation
activities, may impact our expected results.

An
unusual number of product liability or breach of warranty claims for defective
products could expose us to expensive claims and damage our standing with our
customers.

We are
exposed to product liability and product warranty claims relating to the
products we sell that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.  Because we do not have direct control over
the quality of products manufactured or supplied to us by our vendors and
because we self-insure for such product liability and warranty claims, we are
exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products.  Product
liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of
management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the
ultimate outcome. Claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on
customer confidence in the products we stock and in our reputation.

Our
financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical
information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted.

An
important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies, cost reductions, and
sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of
improvements to our management information systems to improve operations such as
inventory replenishment systems, merchandise ordering, transportation, and
receipt processing.  Our financial performance could be adversely
affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are
unable to improve, upgrade, maintain, and expand our systems.

If
the domestic and international supply chain for our products is disrupted, our
sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted.

We source
the approximately 40,000 products we stock and sell from approximately 7,000
domestic and international vendors.  We source many of those products
directly from foreign manufacturers.  Political or financial
instability among suppliers, trade


Index

restrictions,
tariffs, currency exchange rates and transport capacity and costs are beyond our
control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the
movement of products through our supply chain.

Our
inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers of
brand name products could negatively impact our ability to differentiate
ourselves from competitors.

Part of
our expansion strategy includes continued differentiation from
competitors.  To better distinguish our product offering, we form
strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products
under a variety of recognized and respected brand names.  The
inability to effectively and efficiently manage the relationships with these
suppliers could negatively impact our business plan and financial
results.

Item 2

- Properties

At
February 1, 2008, we operated 1,534 stores in the United States and Canada with
a total of 174 million square feet of selling space. Of the total stores
operating at February 1, 2008, approximately 87% are owned, which includes
stores on leased land, with the remainder being leased from unaffiliated
third-parties.  Approximately 49% of our store leases are capital
leases. We also own and operate 13 RDCs and 12 FDCs for lumber and building
commodities.  We lease and operate two additional FDCs. We lease one
third-party distribution facility to serve our Canadian
stores.   We also operate four facilities to support our import
business, Special Order Sales and internet fulfillment.  We own two
and lease two of these facilities.  In addition, we utilize three
third-party transload facilities, which do not hold inventory but are the first
point of receipt for imported products.  We own one data center and
lease one data center that serve as hubs for our computer processing, critical
data storage and information technology systems.  We own our executive
offices, which are located in Mooresville, North Carolina.  We also
own and maintain offices in Wilkes County, North Carolina, and lease and
maintain offices in Toronto, Canada and Monterrey, Mexico.
