Item 1 - Business

General

     Lowe's Companies, Inc. (Lowe's) is the second largest retailer of home
improvement products in the world, with specific emphasis on retail do-it-
yourself (DIY) and commercial business customers.  Lowe's specializes in
offering products and services for home improvement, home decor, home
maintenance, home repair and remodeling and maintenance of commercial
buildings.  Lowe's principal customer groups are DIY retail customers and
commercial business customers.  At January 28, 2000, Lowe's operated 576
stores in 37 states from coast to coast with approximately 57 million square
feet of retail selling space.

     Lowe's was incorporated in North Carolina in 1952 and has been a
publicly held company since 1961.  Lowe's common stock is listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, the Pacific Stock Exchange, and the London Stock
Exchange, with shares trading under the ticker symbol "LOW." Lowe's general
offices are located in Wilkesboro, North Carolina.

     Lowe's has one reportable industry segment - the operation of home
improvement retail stores.  Therefore, see Item 6 "Selected Financial Data"
for the historical data of revenues, profits and identifiable assets of the
Company.

Store Expansion

     Since 1989, Lowe's has been implementing an aggressive store
replacement and expansion strategy, which has transformed Lowe's from a
chain of small stores into a chain of destination home improvement
warehouses.  Lowe's current prototype store has a 121,000 square foot sales
floor with a lawn and garden center comprising approximately 35,000
additional square feet.  Lowe's 2000 expansion plan calls for opening 95
stores (including the relocation of 17 older, smaller format stores).  The
following table illustrates the growth of the Company over the last three
years.
                                               1999    1998    1997

   Number of stores, beginning of year          520     477     427
   New stores opened                             60      50      48
   Relocated stores opened                       31      31      24
   Stores closed                                (35)    (38)    (22)

   Number of stores, end of year                576     520     477

In April 1998, Lowe's announced plans for a major expansion into the
western United States, with plans to build in excess of 100 new stores in
certain western markets over the next three to four years.  During the
fourth quarter of 1999, Lowe's opened six stores in these western markets.
These first stores were located in cities such as Bakersfield and Long
Beach, California and Summerlin, Nevada.  In November 1998, the Company
entered into a merger agreement with Eagle Hardware and Garden, Inc.
(Eagle), which operated 36 home improvement centers in the western United
States.  The acquisition of Eagle, which closed on April 2, 1999, has
enabled Lowe's to accelerate its West Coast expansion and has provided an
immediate presence in a number of key metropolitan markets in the west.
The Eagle stores are in addition to Lowe's previously announced western
market expansion plans.

Customer Service

Lowe's serves both retail and commercial business customers.  Retail
customers are primarily do-it-yourself homeowners and others buying for
personal and family use.  Commercial business customers include building
contractors, repair and remodeling contractors, electricians, landscapers,
painters, plumbers and commercial building maintenance professionals.  Each
Lowe's store caters to this broad array of customers by combining the
merchandise, sales and service of: a home fashions and interior design center;
a lawn and garden center; an appliance dealer; a hard goods discounter;  a
hardware store;  an air conditioning, heating, plumbing and electrical supply
center;  and a building materials supplier.

     Lowe's is committed to providing superior customer satisfaction.
Customer expectations are being met by opening new stores in convenient
shopping locations, by supplying a large selection of in-stock merchandise,
by offering low prices and by providing knowledgeable assistance and fast
service.  If a customer is searching for an item that is not carried in a
store, it is likely available through our special order system.  The
Everyday Competitive Price ("ECP") strategy guarantees the lowest price in
the market and yet builds profitability for Lowe's by substantially
increasing revenues per store.  ECP gives Lowe's customers the confidence
to buy every day without waiting for promotional sales.  Customer
questions, problems, returns and exchanges are handled at a convenient
service desk near the main entrance of the store.  Our customer-friendly
return policy makes it simple to return or exchange products.   Most of our
stores have a separate lumber and building materials cashier and loading
area available for both DIY and commercial business customers.
Additionally, Lowe's offers specific services such as installation (through
subcontractors), delivery, loading, assembly, free how-to clinics, wood and
glass cutting, free kitchen design and a project desk to assist Lowe's
customers in planning their home improvement tasks.

     Lowe's offers two proprietary credit cards - one for individual retail
customers and the other for businesses.  Lowe's commercial business
customers can also make purchases on credit by using Lowe's in-house
accounts.  In addition, Lowe's accepts Visa, MasterCard, Discover and
American Express credit cards.

Products

     A typical Lowe's home improvement warehouse stocks more than 40,000
items, with hundreds of thousands of items available through our special
order system.  Each Lowe's home improvement warehouse carries a wide
selection of high quality, nationally advertised brand name merchandise.
The Company's merchandise selection is broad enough to supply both the DIY
retail and commercial business customer with practically every item needed
to complete any home improvement, repair or construction project.  See Note
14 on page 30 of the Annual Report to Security Holders for fiscal year
ended January 28, 2000 for the table illustrating sales by product category
for each of the last three fiscal years.

     The Company sources its products from approximately 6,500 merchandise
vendors worldwide, with no single vendor accounting for as much as 4% of
total purchases.  The Company is not dependent upon any single vendor.  To
the extent possible, the Company utilizes its global sourcing division to
purchase directly from foreign manufacturers and avoid third party
importers.  Management believes that alternative and competitive suppliers
are available for virtually all its products.

     In order to maintain appropriate inventory levels in stores and to
improve distribution efficiencies, the Company operates six highly
automated, efficient and state-of-the-art regional distribution centers
(RDC's).  The current RDC's are strategically located in North Carolina,
Georgia, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Washington and Texas.  Each Lowe's store is
now served by one of these RDC's.  The Company also operates nine smaller
support facilities in order to distribute merchandise that requires special
handling due to size or type of packaging, such as lumber, roofing, fencing
or lawn mowers.  Approximately 50% of the merchandise purchased by the
Company is shipped through its distribution facilities while the remaining
portion is shipped directly to stores from vendors.  The Company has begun
construction on a regional distribution center in Perris, California which
is expected to be operational in early 2001.  During 2000, construction
will also begin on another regional distribution center to be located in
Findlay, Ohio which is expected to begin operations in late 2001.

Marketing

     The Company reaches target customers through a mixture of television,
radio, direct mail, newspaper and NASCAR sponsorship.  Each marketing
initiative is based on understanding current and prospective customers.
The Company has a strategic alliance with the HGTV network that allows it
to control a substantial portion of the airtime in which only the Company's
and its vendors' commercials are aired.  This is only one example of how
the Company solicits vendor participation in its advertising programs.
Additionally, the Company hosts customer hospitality events and supports
the wide-ranging activities of Lowe's Home Safety Council.

     In 1999, the Company continued to introduce or redefine programs that
respond to the changing needs and lifestyles of targeted customers.
Primary to this effort is the Company's aggressive response to serve
commercial business customers.  The Company has responded to the special
needs of this customer group by carrying more professional brands,
increasing in-stock quantities for bigger jobs and testing various
marketing approaches to win the loyalty of commercial customers.  The
Company currently has thirty product categories available where customers
can have installation arranged through our stores.  In addition, non-
electronic kiosks (electronic kiosks are currently being tested) are
available in departments such as appliances, home decor/flooring,
electrical/lighting, millwork, hardware, seasonal, plumbing and tools.

Competition

     The home improvement retailing business is highly competitive.  The
principal competitive factors are price, location, customer service,
product selection and name recognition.  The Company competes with a number
of traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical and home supply retailers, as
well as other chains of warehouse home improvement stores and lumber yards
in most of its market areas. In addition, the Company competes, with
respect to some of its products, with discount stores, mail order firms,
and warehouse clubs.

     Lowe's is the second largest retailer of home improvement products in
the world.  Due to the large number and variety of competitors, management
is unable to precisely measure the Company's market share in its existing
market areas.  However, Lowe's defines the market segments that it serves
as DIY, repair/remodeling, rugs and carpets, appliances and specialty trade
construction.  This total market is estimated to be $300 billion of which
Lowe's share is estimated to be approximately 5%.

Information Systems

     The Company is continuously assessing and upgrading its information
systems to support growth, control costs, and enable better decision-
making.  During the last six years, the Company has made a substantial
investment in developing and purchasing new computer systems.  These new
applications include Distribution, Electronic Data Interchange, Payroll and
Human Resources, General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Forecasting and
Replenishment, and Supply Services.  Lowe's has a point of sale system,
electronic bar code scanning system, various design systems and a UNIX
Server in each of its stores.  Store information is communicated to the
support center's central computer via a terrestrial based (frame relay)
network with back-up being provided by a satellite based wide area network.
These systems provide efficient customer check-out with automated credit
card approval, store-based inventory management with automatic
replenishment orders, labor planning and item movement experience.  These
computers supply the general office functions with the information needed
to support the stores.

Employees

     At the end of January 2000, the Company employed approximately 70,000
full-time and 16,000 part-time employees, none of which are covered by any
collective bargaining agreements.  Management considers its relations with
its employees to be good.


Item 2 - Properties

     At January 28, 2000, the Company operated 576 stores with a total of
57.0 million square feet of selling space.  The current prototype large
store is a 121,000 square foot sales floor with a lawn and garden center
comprising approximately 35,000 additional square feet.  Of the total
stores operating at January 28, 2000, 357 of the facilities are owned with
the remainder being leased.  Approximately one-half of these leases are
capital leases.  The Company also owns and operates six regional
distribution centers and nine smaller support facilities, four of which are
reload centers for lumber and building commodities.  The Company's general
offices are located in Wilkesboro, North Carolina and occupy several
buildings, the majority of which are owned.

     See the "Lowe's Stores" table on page 7 of the Annual Report to
Security Holders for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2000.
