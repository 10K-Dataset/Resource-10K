General
Information

Lowe’s
Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is a Fortune 50 company and the
world’s second largest home improvement retailer.  As of January 30,
2009, we operated 1,638 stores across 50 states and 11 stores in
Canada.  Our 1,649 stores represent approximately 187 million square
feet of retail selling space.

Incorporated
in North Carolina in 1952, Lowe’s Companies, Inc. has been publicly held since
1961. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange - ticker symbol
“LOW.”

See Item
6, “Selected Financial Data,” for historical revenues, profits and identifiable
assets.

Who
We Serve

We serve
homeowners, renters and Commercial Business Customers.  Homeowners and
renters primarily consist of do-it-yourself (DIY) customers and do-it-for-me
(DIFM) customers who utilize our installed sales programs, as well as others
buying for personal and family use.  Commercial Business Customers
include those who work in the construction, repair/remodel, commercial and
residential property management, and business maintenance
professions.

To meet
customers’ varying home improvement needs, we offer a complete line of products
and services for home decorating, maintenance, repair, remodeling, and property
maintenance.  We offer home improvement products in the following
categories: appliances, lumber, paint, flooring, building materials, millwork,
lawn & landscape products, fashion plumbing, hardware, lighting, tools,
seasonal living, rough plumbing, outdoor power equipment, cabinets &
countertops, nursery, rough electrical, home environment, home organization, and
windows & walls.

Our Market

Using the
most recent comprehensive data available, which is from 2007, we estimate the
size of the U.S. home improvement market to be approximately $695 billion
annually, comprised of $535 billion of product demand and $160 billion of
installed labor opportunity during that period.  Data from a variety of
primary and secondary sources, including trade associations, government
publications, industry participants and other sources was analyzed as the basis
for our estimate.  This data captures a wide range of categories
relevant to our business, including major appliances and garden
supplies.  Based on the most recently available data we believe that
the size of the U.S. home improvement market decreased by more than 7% in
2008.

The home
improvement retailing business includes many competitors.  We compete
with a number of traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical and home supply
retailers, as well as other chains of warehouse home improvement stores and
lumberyards in most of our trade areas.  In addition, we compete, with
respect to some of our products, with general merchandise stores, mail order
firms, warehouse clubs, and online retailers.  The principal
competitive factors are customer service, location, price, product and brand
selection, and name recognition.

There are
many variables that impact consumer demand for the products and services we
offer.  Key indicators we monitor include employment, real disposable
personal income, housing turnover, and home ownership levels.  We also
monitor demographic and societal trends that are indicators of home improvement
industry growth.

§

Employment
      is an indicator of home improvement sales.  The forecasted
      average unemployment rate of 8.6% for 2009 from the March 2009 Blue
      Chip Economic Indicators™ is higher than the 5.7% average seen in
      2008 and suggests that Americans will continue to face challenging
      employment prospects this year.

§

Although
      real disposable personal income continues to grow, it is projected to grow
      at a slower pace for 2009 than the long-term average annual increase of
      3.4%, calculated from 1960 to 2008.  Real disposable personal
      income growth is forecasted to be 1.7% for calendar 2009, compared with
      1.1% for calendar 2008, based on data from the March 2009 Blue Chip
      Economic Indicators™.

§

Housing
      turnover, which peaked in calendar year 2005, continues to slow
      according to The National Association of Realtors®.  Recent data
      suggests that 2009 will remain challenging for housing
      turnover.

§

According
      to the U.S. Census Bureau, while U.S. home ownership levels over the
      past year have continued their decline
from


2007,
      they remain above their historical average.  Home ownership
      provides an established customer base for home maintenance and repair
      projects.   The vast majority of our customers are
      homeowners and they are not willing to let what is often their most
      valuable financial asset
deteriorate.

Currently,
all of these indicators suggest continued weakness in consumer
demand.  In this economic environment, we seek to balance our
long-term growth plans with a near-term focus on conserving capital and
maintaining liquidity.

Our
Stores

New
Store Expansion

We
opened 115 new stores in fiscal 2008, including five Canadian stores
located primarily in the Greater Toronto Area.  Our 2008 store
openings included three primary prototypes: 117,000-square-foot (117K) and
103,000-square-foot (103K) stores for large markets and a 94,000-square-foot
(94K) store to serve smaller markets.  The following table illustrates
our store expansion over the last three years:

We expect
to open 60 to 70 new stores in fiscal 2009, which includes continued expansion
in Canada as well as our first stores in Monterrey, Mexico.  Our
fiscal 2009 store openings will be comprised primarily of 117K, 103K and 94K
stores.  As we continue our expansion and strive to maximize our
return on investment, we consider market demographics and land availability,
among other factors, to determine the appropriate prototype for a particular
market.  The reduction in store openings in 2009 as compared to 2008
reflects the challenging current economic environment.

Investments
in Existing Stores

During
fiscal 2008, we continued our long history of investing in our existing stores
to enhance the shopping experience for our retail and Commercial Business
Customers, while at the same time rationalizing our capital spending on these
efforts to ensure appropriate return on investment.  These efforts
included re-lamping our stores at regular intervals to ensure they remained
bright, adding new displays, improving point-of-sale and directional signage,
adding more product selection, repainting our building exteriors, and
re-striping our parking lots.  We categorize our merchandising-related
investments in our stores as resets or remerchandising.

Resets

Resets
are necessary to keep our stores fresh with new and innovative products, updated
fashions and compelling displays.  These resets can involve changing
products, displays and vendors.  However, they generally do not
require major changes in the store.  We conducted hundreds of resets
in fiscal 2008, with each reset typically being performed across most
or all of our stores.

Remerchandising

In fiscal
2008, we completed the remerchandising of 79 of our earlier format stores to
make them more closely resemble our most current store
prototypes.  These remerchandising efforts were focused on moving
entire departments, improving adjacencies and enhancing the shopability within
the appliances, cabinets & countertops, flooring, fashion plumbing, paint,
lighting, and home style & organization departments.  We also
replaced or refurbished all of our selling centers as well as returns and
customer service areas of these stores.  All new interior graphics,
signage, and way-finding materials were also added to increase shopability and
brighten the atmosphere.  Finally, self check-out was included as a
part of these remerchandising efforts for locations where it had not previously
been installed.  These enhancements enable our stores to deliver
stronger sales by offering our customers a best-in-class shopping
experience.

Serving
Our Customers

Our
vision is to be our customers’ first choice for home improvement.  To
achieve this vision, we continue to focus on excellent customer service,
Everyday Low Prices, New Lower Price, and innovative operational, merchandising,
marketing and distribution


strategies.  We
believe customers’ perceptions of the quality of service determine a retailer’s
success or failure.  Therefore, we are always looking for ways to
improve our level of service, optimize store labor and drive in-store process
improvement, build our talent pool, and enhance our sales
culture.  The following are several key initiatives we believe will
continue to support our growth and success going forward.

Everyday
Low Prices

Our
customers do not have to wait for a sale to find a great value.  We
offer low prices every day.  Our promise to customers is that if they
find a lower everyday or advertised price on an identical stock product at a
local competitor, we will not just match that price, but we will beat it by
10%.

Specialty
Sales

Our
Specialty Sales initiatives include Installed Sales, Special Order Sales and
Commercial Business Customer sales.

We recognize the
opportunity that our Specialty Sales initiatives represent and the importance of
these businesses to our long-term growth.  However, in the current
economic environment demand for Installed Sales and Special Order Sales
offerings has declined due to hesitancy by consumers to make big ticket
discretionary purchases.

Installed
Sales

We offer
installation services in over 40 categories with flooring, millwork and cabinets
& countertops generating the highest sales.  Our Installed Sales
model, which includes the separation of selling and administrative tasks, allows
our sales associates to maintain their focus on project selling, while project
managers ensure that the details related to an installation job are efficiently
executed.  Installed Sales, which includes both product and labor,
accounted for approximately 6% of total sales in fiscal 2008.

Special
Order Sales

Our
Special Order Sales product offerings provide our customers the opportunity to
select a wider assortment of product options beyond the approximately 40,000 we
carry in our stores.  We are making the Special Order Sales process
easier for customers by providing more product displays and electronic product
catalogs in our stores, as well as on Lowes.com.  We continue to
enhance integrated design tools and ordering systems storewide in order for
customers to envision projects, as well as to efficiently receive quotations and
complete an order.

Our
Special Order Express initiative is intended to allow for faster and more
efficient delivery of Special Order products to customers, while at the same
time provide the ability to better manage our inventory
investment.  Under this approach, certain items that do not have
enough individual store demand to be economically stocked in all stores, but
have sizeable demand across a group of stores, will be kept on hand in our
distribution centers.  This allows for fast shipment to our stores, or
in some cases, direct shipment to a customer’s home.  Our Special
Order Express initiative allows us to balance quickly satisfying customers’
needs with a desire to minimize our inventory investment.  We will
continue to refine and enhance this initiative in fiscal 2009.

Commercial
Business Customers

Growth in
total sales to Commercial Business Customers continued to outpace the company
average in fiscal 2008.  Our focus remains being a valued business
partner to our customers who work in the construction, repair/remodel,
commercial and residential property management, and business maintenance
professions.  Because we understand the challenges of the current
economic environment and the importance of timeliness to these customers, we
continue to evaluate and tailor our product, service, and competitive offerings
to best meet the needs of these customers.  These programs focus on
in-stock and special order merchandise, contractor packs, business credit,
pricing for larger projects, our LowesForPros.com dedicated business website,
and convenience services such as fast ordering and 7-day delivery.

Lowes.com

Lowes.com
seeks to empower consumers by providing a 24/7 shopping experience and helping
reduce the complexity of product decisions and home improvement projects by
providing online product information, customer ratings and reviews, online
buying guides and how-to videos and information.  These tools help
consumers make smarter, more informed purchasing decisions and give consumers
confidence as they undertake simple to more complex home improvement
projects.  We also enable consumers to choose from a variety of
multichannel fulfillment options including buy online and pick-up in-store,
product delivery and direct shipment to customers’ homes.  As our business
evolves we continue to look for opportunities beyond fulfillment to leverage
emerging technologies and online trends to build strong relationships with
consumers that will make us the first choice for their home improvement
needs.

Credit
Financing

We offer
a proprietary credit card for retail customers.  In addition, we offer
a Lowe’s Project Card in all stores.  Lowe’s Project Card provides a
major project, in-store financing solution to complement our Lowe’s Consumer
Revolving Credit Card.


We also
offer proprietary credit programs for Commercial Business
Customers.  They include a Lowe’s Business Account, which is ideal for
small- to medium-size businesses and offers minimum monthly payments, and Lowe’s
Accounts Receivable, which is ideal for medium- to large-size businesses that
pay in full each month.

In
addition, we accept Visa®, MasterCard®, Discover® and American Express® credit
cards, as well as debit cards from all major networks.

For
additional detail regarding our credit programs, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, and Item 8, “Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data.”

Our
Products

Product
Sourcing

We source
our products from over 7,000 merchandise vendors worldwide, with no single
vendor accounting for more than seven percent of total
purchases.  Management believes that alternative and competitive
suppliers are available for virtually all our products.  Whenever
possible, we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings for our
customers and gross margin improvement for Lowe’s.

In
addition to offering a wide selection of national brand name merchandise, we are
committed to building long-term value for Lowe’s through the development of
exclusive, proprietary brands where we focus on delivering the best quality, the
best value and recognizably differentiated products to meet our customers’ needs
and wants.

National
Brand Name Merchandise

In many
product categories, customers look for a brand they know and trust to instill
confidence in their purchase.  A typical Lowe's home improvement store
stocks approximately 40,000 items, with hundreds of thousands of items available
through our Special Order Sales system.  Each store carries a wide
selection of national brand name merchandise such as KitchenAid®, Samsung,
Whirlpool®, Pella®, Werner®, Kohler®, DeWalt®, John Deere, Troy-Bilt®, Bosch®,
Valspar®, Owens Corning®, Electrolux®, Porter-Cable® and many
more.  Our merchandise selection provides the DIY, DIFM and Commercial
Business Customer a one-stop shop for products needed to complete home
improvement, repair, maintenance or construction projects.

Proprietary
Brands

To
further differentiate our offering, we carry many brands that are exclusive to
Lowe’s.  These unique brands cover several categories like lighting,
flooring, tools and more, and give our customers great quality and value.
Exclusive brand names such as Premier Living™, Kobalt®, Portfolio®, Harbor
Breeze®, Reliabilt®, Top-Choice® Lumber and Utilitech™ are found only at
Lowe’s.

Distribution
Network

To
efficiently move product from our vendors to our stores and maintain in-stock
levels, we own and operate 14 highly-automated regional distribution centers
(RDCs).  The RDCs are strategically located in North Carolina (2),
Georgia, Indiana, Pennsylvania (2), Texas, California, Ohio, Florida,
Connecticut, Wyoming, Illinois and Oregon.  On average, each RDC
serves 118 stores.  We also utilize a third-party distribution
facility to serve our Canadian stores.

We
operate 15 flatbed distribution centers (FDCs) to distribute merchandise that
requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber,
boards, panel products, irrigation pipe, vinyl sidings, ladders and building
materials.  We own 13 and lease two of these FDCs.

We also
operate four facilities to support our import business, Special Order Sales and
internet fulfillment.  We own two and lease two of these
facilities.  In addition, we utilize three third-party transload
facilities.  These facilities do not hold inventory, but are the first
point of receipt for imported products.  The transload facilities sort
and allocate products to RDCs based on individual store demand and
forecasts.

On
average in fiscal 2008, over 72% of the stock merchandise we purchased was
shipped through our distribution network, while the remaining portion was
shipped directly to stores from our vendors.

Building Our Brand

Customers
want Lowe’s to serve as a resource for products and projects to help them
repair, maintain, and enhance their homes and communities.  Our
marketing and advertising programs, communicated via television, radio,
newspaper, magazine, direct mail,


sponsorships,
internet and in-store programs, all play a critical role in cultivating this
emotional and rational connection with the consumer. Through an extensive
understanding of our customers and their needs and expectations, we deliver a
message that will develop loyal customer relationships and differentiate Lowe’s
from other home improvement sources.

With the
downturn in the economy that accelerated in the second half of fiscal 2008,
consumers became even more value conscious.  As a result, we adjusted
our communication to ensure that we presented value to consumers even more
clearly, given our platform of Everyday Low Prices.

New
Lower Price

Our
ongoing New Lower Price initiative, which has been in place for several years,
highlights price reductions on products that consumers want to purchase
everyday.  In the current economic environment, we are emphasizing
this initiative to pass along cost savings in order to deliver enhanced value to
our customers.

Media
Investment

A
combination of national broadcast and cable television, supplemented by a number
of national magazines, internet banner advertising and search investment,
provides the platform for building brand awareness. We complement the
national media investment in key markets by local television and radio
schedules.

In the
past, newspaper circulars and ROP (Run of Press) served as the primary
communication vehicle for retail price and item messaging, and regularly
featured Lowe’s breadth of product selection, customer services and Everyday Low
Price positioning. However, given the accelerating erosion in newspaper
subscription bases and readership, we have invested time and money in
alternative retail price and item advertising delivery vehicles.  We
are testing new on-line vehicles that deliver to a large audience at a low
cost.  We believe this is more efficient and effective advertising in
today’s fast paced and on-line world.

Major
promotional events receive network radio support with a local radio overlay in
key markets.  We promote internet access to Lowe’s retail advertising
through the use of online banner and circular advertising. In many cases, we
feature our entire circular on-line within the on-line advertising section of
major market newspapers.  This is a location of increasing readership,
as more households read their newspaper on line.  The Lowe’s brand has
also been successfully integrated into television programming, including the
Oprah Winfrey show and Rate My Space on HGTV.

Direct
to Consumer Marketing

We
continue to refine programs to respond to the changing needs and lifestyles of
consumers.  Through innovative database technology, we create direct mail
campaigns based on precise criteria such as purchase activity, affinity group
subscription(s), household demographics, regional weather patterns, opt-in email
requests, and even consumers who are preparing to move, are in the process of
moving or have recently moved into a new home (“New Movers”).

Despite
the housing slow-down, New Movers continue to spend considerably more on their
previous and new homes than the average homeowner.  This past year, we
executed our New Movers program through the U.S. Postal Service’s change of
address program.  As the renter population grew in 2008, we quickly
remixed our focus of this New Movers program to be more inclusive of this
customer group, as well as the new opportunities associated with repairing and
renovating foreclosed homes that have been repurchased.

Additionally,
opt-in e-mail programs line up with Lowe’s affinity and education
programs:  Lowe’s Creative Ideas for Home and Garden®, Lowe’s Creative
Ideas for Outdoor Living™ and Lowe’s Creative Ideas for Woodworkers™.  The
Lowe’s Creative Ideas Magazine subscription base is now as large as many major
magazines and has become a very efficient way to market Lowe’s to a group of our
most valuable customers.

Membership
in the Team Lowe’s Racing Fan Club and participation in the Build-n-Grow
children’s clinics creates another level of engagement with our consumers both
inside Lowe’s stores and beyond our walls.  Each of these varying
acquisition and retention programs creates loyal Lowe’s customers.

Multicultural
Marketing

Lowe’s
reaches its diverse communities and customer base in various manners, including
multicultural marketing and outreach to Hispanic, African-American and Asian
customers.  For these cultural groups, Lowe’s executes advertising across
many media, including television, radio, print, and on line, in both English and
native languages.  Some of the unique efforts include La Cancha Lowe’s,
Lowe’s Hispanic mobile marketing program providing fun to families at key soccer
events across the country; Lowe’s sponsorship of the CIAA’s annual Basketball
Tournament, the nation’s oldest black athletic conference consisting of ten
historically African-American institutions of higher education, that has
blossomed into one of largest collegiate post-season tournaments in the country;
the national Lowe’s sponsorship of the Piolin and Monique radio programs
targeted to Hispanic and African American listeners; and Lowe’s new Chinese,
Korean, and Vietnamese language websites offering a new way for many Asian
consumers to learn more about home improvement.


Team
Lowe’s Racing

NASCAR
remains an important part of building our brand. We are the proud sponsor of
Jimmie Johnson, three time NASCAR Sprint® Cup Series champion, the #48 car and
Lowe’s Motor Speedway.  We also host hospitality events at various
sites throughout the racing season, leveraging and further building membership
in the Team Lowe’s Racing Fan Club.  In 2008, we continued to sponsor
Adrian Fernandez and Fernandez Racing to field the #15 car in the American Le
Mans Series whose fan base is very different than that of
NASCAR.  Going to market through both the #48 and #15 teams, helps us
to connect with a broad base of customers through one of America’s favorite
sports – auto racing.

Reaching
Out

We
believe community involvement extends beyond the boundaries of our
stores.  In 2008, Lowe's and the Lowe's Charitable and
Educational Foundation contributed more than $26 million to communities in which
we operate across North America.  Following are some examples of how
we are partnering with respected nonprofit organizations to make a difference in
our communities:

Lowe’s
Charitable and Educational Foundation

The
Lowe’s Charitable and Educational Foundation (LCEF) was created in 1957 to
assist communities through financial contributions while also encouraging
employees to become involved through volunteerism.  In 2008, the
Foundation supported more than 1,400 community and education projects in the
U.S. and Canada with grants totaling more than $15 million.  Programs
funded by LCEF include Lowe’s Toolbox for Education

®,

SkillsUSA and Rebuilding
Together®.

o

Toolbox
      for Education® has two goals: Get parents involved in their children’s
      education and provide grants to parent groups to help improve their
      children’s schools.  In 2008, Lowe’s Toolbox for Education grant
      program contributed more than $4 million to schools throughout all 50
      states.

o

In
      2008, LCEF donated $1 million to SkillsUSA, a national nonprofit
      organization serving teachers and high school and college students who are
      preparing for careers in trade, technical and skilled service
      occupations.  Additionally in June, Lowe’s helped kick off the
      SkillsUSA National Leadership and Skills Conference in Kansas City, Mo.,
      which showcases the skills of career and technical education
      students.

o

Lowe’s
      also continued its commitment to supporting safe and affordable housing in
      2008 with a contribution from LCEF of $1 million to Rebuilding Together,
      the nation’s largest all-volunteer home rehabilitation
      organization.  For the second year, Lowe’s and Rebuilding
      Together worked together to support 83 projects that allowed low-income
      homeowners to stay warm and safe in their own
  homes.

Habitat
for Humanity

As a home
improvement retailer, Lowe’s helps our customers every day through the trials
and triumphs of home ownership.  For more than five years, Lowe’s and
Habitat for Humanity® International have worked together to combat substandard
housing across America.  In 2008, Lowe’s contributed $2 million to
help Habitat for Humanity International forward its goal of eliminating poverty
housing, bringing Lowe’s total Habitat donations to more than $18 million since
2003.  This support has benefited more than 1,400
families.  Additionally since 2004, Lowe’s has underwritten the
Habitat for Humanity Women Build® program, which empowers women to learn
construction skills through How-to Clinics held at Lowe’s stores and to put
those skills to use on build sites nationwide.  In 2008, Habitat for
Humanity and Lowe’s launched National Women Build Week, hosting 150 Women Build
projects in all 50 states in the week leading up to Mother’s
Day.  Lowe’s pledged $750,000 to the initiative, contributing a $5,000
grant to each National Women Build Week participating affiliate.

Partnering
with Customers

In
addition to contributions made by Lowe’s, we have partnered with our customers
to support organizations such as the American Red Cross and the Muscular
Dystrophy Association (MDA).  Over the nearly 10-year span that Lowe’s
has supported the American Red Cross, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and
wildfires have destroyed property and forever changed lives.  A
constant throughout has been the quick action of Lowe’s employees and customers
to help establish and support donation sites, resulting in more than $20 million
in contributions.  In addition, for the first time during 2008, Lowe’s
took its grassroots store support for MDA nationwide, making it one of the
largest supporters of MDA’s Shamrocks Against Dystrophy Campaign. In 2008,
Lowe’s stores helped raise more than $2 million during the Shamrocks campaign,
bringing the total raised since the Lowe’s program began in the stores to more
than $4 million.

Partnering
with Employees

Lowe’s
also partners with its employees through Lowe’s Heroes and the Lowe’s Employee
Relief Fund.  Lowe’s Heroes employee volunteers tackle local problems
in their communities.  In 2008, Lowe’s Heroes responded to needs big
and small from Ontario, Canada, to Orange County, California.  The
Lowe’s Employee Relief Fund distributes emergency funds to our employees who
face financial hardships due to natural disasters, house fires or
illness.  Making our donations even more powerful, Lowe’s matches
each


employee

Information
Systems

We are
continuously assessing and upgrading our information systems in an effort to
support growth, augment new sales initiatives, control costs and enable better
decision-making.  Our systems support all functions in the stores,
distribution facilities, field-based offices, and the customer support centers
in Mooresville, NC and Wilkesboro, NC.  Our two state-of-the-art data
centers provide many additional fail-safe features to improve system
availability and mitigate risks associated with unplanned outages.

We have
invested significant resources to safeguard sensitive employee and customer
information.  We work closely with industry standards groups to
incorporate security best practices into our technology
environment.

Employees

As of
January 30, 2009, we employed approximately 164,000 full-time and 65,000
part-time employees, none of which are covered by collective bargaining
agreements.  Management considers its relations with its employees to
be good.

Item 1A - Risk Factors

We are
exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Most are general risks and
uncertainties applicable to all retailers, but some are more particular to
retailers serving the home improvement industry.   Our operations
may also be affected by factors that are either not currently known to us or
which we currently consider immaterial to our business.  We describe
below some of the specific known factors that could negatively affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.  All
forward-looking statements made by us in this Annual Report to the Securities
and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K, in our Annual Report to Shareholders and
in our subsequently filed quarterly and current reports to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, as well as in our press releases and other public
communications, are qualified by the risks described below.

Our
sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general
economy.

General
economic factors and other conditions, both domestically and internationally,
may adversely affect the U.S. economy, the global economy and our financial
performance.  These include, but are not limited to, periods of flat
economic growth or recession, volatility and/or lack of liquidity from time to
time in U.S. and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability
and/or higher cost of credit to Lowe’s and its customers, slower rates of growth
in real disposable personal income, higher rates of unemployment, higher
consumer debt levels, increasing fuel and energy costs, inflation or deflation
of commodity prices, natural disasters, acts of terrorism and developments in
the war against terrorism in Asia and the Middle East.

The deep
global recession that officially began in the U.S. in December 2007 and the
financial/credit crisis that has led to the collapse, government bailout or
acquisition of weakened major financial institutions have had and will continue
to have significant adverse effects on our results of
operations.  Rising unemployment, reduced consumer confidence and
reduced access to credit have combined to lead to sharply reduced consumer
spending, particularly by our customers on many of the discretionary, big-ticket
items we sell that tend to be larger home improvement project
driven.  Consumer confidence and willingness to spend on discretionary
items remains low and our sales and results of operations will continue to be
adversely affected throughout the current fiscal year and, if the recovery from
this deep recessionary period and financial crisis is unusually gradual and
prolonged as some are predicting, potentially beyond.

Adverse
changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may
negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable store
sales.

Sales of
many of our product categories and services are driven by housing turnover and
activity level of home improvement projects.  Sharply declining home
prices that are expected to continue to decline in 2009, increasing mortgage
delinquency and foreclosure rates, reduction in the availability of mortgage
financing, rising interest rates on variable rate mortgages, and significantly
lower housing


turnover,
have limited and may continue to limit consumers’ discretionary spending,
particularly on discretionary items, and affect their confidence level leading
to further reduced spending on home improvement projects.  The impact
of these economic factors specific to the home improvement industry is
exacerbated by rising unemployment in a weak job market.

Unseasonable
weather conditions and adverse weather events can negatively affect our total
sales and comparable store sales.

If
weather conditions are uncharacteristic of the time of year during any season,
they can hurt our sales by making it difficult to sell seasonal
merchandise.   Although the impact of unseasonable weather
conditions is mitigated somewhat by the broad geographic dispersion of our
stores, they continue to be a significant risk to the overall performance of our
business, particularly when they occur across a broad region of the
U.S.  Adverse weather events, such as a prolonged and widespread
drought, can hurt our sales of particular products as well.

Our
store expansion and relocation strategy depends upon our ability to successfully
open and operate new stores each year.

Our
growth in total sales depends not only on a recovery from the current
recessionary period but also to a substantial degree on successfully and
cost-effectively implementing our ongoing expansion program.  We
scaled back our expansion plans significantly last year and plan to scale back
even further in the current fiscal year in response to the weak
environment.   As we expand further, we must adapt our
merchandising, marketing and distribution initiatives to new markets both
domestically and as we continue to expand into Canada and
Mexico.   We also plan to increase the number of our stores in
markets in which we currently operate.  Our ability to open additional
stores depends, in large measure, upon our ability to locate and acquire new
store sites on acceptable terms.   Local land use and other
regulations restricting the construction of buildings in the formats with which
we operate may affect our ability to open new stores in some
markets.  As we develop more new stores in metropolitan markets, we
may incur increased costs to remediate environmental pollution on some of the
sites we are redeveloping that was caused by previous owners of those
sites.  Our ability to continue to expand our operations depends also
on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified
employees.  If we are unable to open new stores at the rate we
currently plan and staff them with qualified employees, the growth in our sales
and our competitive position could be adversely affected.

If
we fail to hire, train and retain qualified managers, sales associates and other
employees we could lose sales to our competitors.

Customers’
perceptions of the quality of service provided by employees can determine any
retailer’s success or failure.  If we fail to attract, train and
retain qualified managers and sales associates our financial performance could
be adversely impacted.  Consumers shopping for goods and services for
home improvement projects expect to have sales associates serving them who are
knowledgeable about product categories located throughout our
stores.

Excessive
turnover, which has historically been high among employees in entry-level or
part-time positions, increases the risk that sales associates will not have the
training and experience needed to provide competitive, high quality customer
service.

Our
success in serving the needs of Commercial Business Customers is dependent upon
our ability to attract and retain qualified commercial sales
specialists.

Commercial
Business Customers in the home improvement industry require that we have
well-trained commercial sales specialists at our project desks.  By
doing so, we can better serve the needs of this customer on a consistent
basis.  Our commercial sales specialists have a great depth of
knowledge about the products needed by Commercial Business
Customers.  If we fail to staff our project desks with experienced and
knowledgeable employees, we run the risk that we will lose Commercial Business
Customers.

We
have many competitors, who, if we fail to execute our merchandising, marketing
and distribution strategies effectively, could take sales and market share from
us.

We
operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and
services and have numerous large and small, direct and indirect
competitors.  The competitive environment in which we operate is
particularly challenging during recessionary periods with heavy promotions,
particularly of discretionary items, and competitor closings. The principal
competitive factors in our industry include location of stores, price and
quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and
presentation, and customer service.  Our failure to respond
effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could
affect our financial performance.  Moreover, changes in the
promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors, including the
effects of competitor liquidation activities, may impact our expected
results.

An
unusual number of product liability or breach of warranty claims for defective
products could expose us to expensive claims and damage our standing with
customers.

We are
exposed to product liability and product warranty claims relating to the
products we sell that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.  Because we do not have direct control over
the quality of products manufactured or supplied to us by our vendors and
because we self-insure for such product liability and warranty claims, we are
exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products.  Product
liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of
management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the
ultimate outcome. Claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on
customer confidence in the products we stock and in our reputation.


Our
financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical
information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted.

An
important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies, cost reductions, and
sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of
improvements to our management information systems to improve operations such as
inventory replenishment systems, merchandise ordering, transportation, and
receipt processing.  Our financial performance could be adversely
affected if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are
unable to improve, upgrade, maintain, and expand our systems.

If
the domestic or international supply chain for our products is disrupted, our
sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted.

We source
the approximately 40,000 products we stock and sell from approximately 7,000
domestic and international vendors.  We source many of those products
directly from foreign manufacturers.  Political or financial
instability among suppliers, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange
rates and transport capacity and costs are beyond our control and could
negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of
products through our supply chain.

The current global
recession and credit crisis are adversely affecting the operations and financial
stability of some of our vendors by reducing their sales and restricting their
access to capital.  We may have to replace some of our smaller
vendors, and some of our vendors may not be able to fulfill their financial
obligations to us or to do so in a timely manner.

Our
inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers of
brand name products could negatively impact our ability to differentiate
ourselves from competitors.

Part of
our expansion strategy includes continued differentiation from
competitors.  To better distinguish our product offering, we form
strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products
under a variety of recognized and respected brand names.  The
inability to effectively and efficiently manage the relationships with these
suppliers could negatively impact our business plan and financial
results.

Item 1B - Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2 - Properties

At
January 30, 2009 we operated 1,649 stores in the U.S. and Canada with a total of
187 million square feet of selling space. Of the total stores operating at
January 30, 2009, approximately 88% are owned, which includes stores on leased
land, with the remainder being leased from unaffiliated
third-parties.  Approximately 49% of our store leases are capital
leases. We also own and operate 14 RDCs and 13 FDCs for lumber and building
commodities.  We lease and operate two additional FDCs. We operate one
third-party distribution facility to serve our Canadian
stores.   We also operate four facilities to support our import
business, Special Order Sales and internet fulfillment.  We own two
and lease two of these facilities.  In addition, we utilize three
third-party transload facilities, which do not hold inventory but are the first
point of receipt for imported products.  We own one data center and
lease one data center that serve as hubs for our computer processing, critical
data storage and information technology systems.  We own our executive
offices, which are located in Mooresville, North Carolina.  We also
own and maintain offices in Wilkes County, North Carolina, and lease and
maintain offices in Toronto, Canada and Monterrey, Mexico.
