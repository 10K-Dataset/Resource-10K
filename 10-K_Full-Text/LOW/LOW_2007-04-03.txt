Our
        Stores

New
        Store Expansion

Our
        expansion strategy led to the opening of 155 stores in fiscal 2006 (151 new
        and
        four relocated) that included two primary prototypes:

a
        117,000-square-foot (117K) store for large markets and a 94,000-square-foot
        (94K) store to serve smaller markets. In fiscal 2007, we estimate that
        approximately 80% of our growth will be comprised of 117K stores in larger
        markets and approximately 20% of our growth will be comprised of 94K stores
        in
        smaller markets.

International
        Expansion

In
        June
        2005, we announced expansion plans into Canada. Based on information obtained
        through a thorough market assessment, we are adapting our U.S. business model
        to
        best meet the unique needs and attributes of the Canadian market. Plans are
        to
        open five to six stores in the Greater Toronto Area in the second half of
        fiscal
        2007.

In
        January 2007, we announced expansion plans into Mexico. We expect to open
        three
        to five stores in Monterrey in fiscal 2009.

Investments
        in Existing Stores

During
        fiscal 2006, we continued our long history of investing in our existing stores
        to create a more inviting shopping experience for our retail and Commercial
        Business Customers. This included relamping our stores at regular intervals
        to
        ensure they remain bright, adding new displays, improving point-of-sale and
        directional signage, adding more product selection, repainting our building
        exteriors, and re-striping our parking lots. We categorize our
        merchandising-related investments in our stores as follows:


Resets

Resets
        are necessary to drive comparable store sales increases and keep our stores
        fresh with new and innovative products. These resets involve the replacement
        of
        a particular product or vendor and do not require major changes in the store.
        We
        conducted hundreds of resets in fiscal 2006.

Remerchandising

In
        fiscal
        2006, we completed the remerchandising of 150 of our earlier format stores
        to
        make them more closely resemble our most current store prototypes. These
        remerchandising efforts focused on moving entire departments, improving
        adjacencies, and enhancing the shopability within the appliances, cabinets
&
countertops, flooring, fashion plumbing, paint, walls/windows, lighting,
        home
        organization, lumber and building materials departments. In addition, we
        replaced or refurbished all of our selling centers, including the returns
        and
        customer service areas of these stores. All new interior graphics, signage,
        and
        way-finding materials were also added to increase shopability and brighten
        the
        atmosphere. Finally, we installed self check-out in all 150 of our
        remerchandised stores. We were able to remerchandise these stores with minimal
        disruption to our customers. We continuously make these investments to maintain
        our best-in-class stores. These enhancements enable our stores to continue
        to
        deliver the sales performance we expect, and also offer customers the shopping
        experience and environment they deserve.

Serving
        Our Customers

Our
        vision is to be our customers’ first choice for home improvement. To achieve
        this vision, we continue to focus on excellent customer service, Everyday
        Low
        Prices, and innovative operational, merchandising, marketing and distribution
        strategies. We believe customers’ perceptions of the quality of service
        determine a retailer’s success or failure. Therefore, we are always looking for
        ways to improve our level of service, optimize store labor and drive in-store
        process improvement, build our talent pool, and enhance our sales culture.
        The
        following are several key initiatives we believe will continue to support
        our
        growth and success going forward.

Specialty
        Sales

We
        recognize the opportunity that our Specialty Sales initiatives represent
        and the
        importance of these businesses to our long-term growth. Our Specialty Sales
        initiatives include three major categories: Installed Sales, Special Order
        Sales
        and Commercial Business Customer sales, internally referred to as the “Big 3.”
In addition, our effort to utilize e-Commerce to drive sales and conveniently
        provide product information to customers is managed by our Specialty Sales
        group.

Installed
        Sales

We
        offer
        installation services in over 40 categories with

flooring,
        millwork and cabinets & countertops generating the highest sales. Our
        Installed Sales model, which includes the separation of selling and
        administrative tasks, allows our sales associates to shift their focus to
        project selling, while project managers ensure that the details related to
        an
        installation job are efficiently executed. Installed Sales, which includes
        both
        product and labor, has proven to be a successful service initiative accounting
        for approximately 6% of total sales in fiscal 2006. We also continue to refine
        our offerings, including an ongoing test of an in-home selling model for
        certain
        Installed Sales categories.

Special
        Order Sales

Our
        Special Order Sales product offerings provide our customers the opportunity
        to
        select a wider assortment of product options beyond the approximately 40,000
        we
        carry in our stores. We are making the Special Order Sales process easier
        for
        customers by providing more product displays and electronic product catalogs
        in
        our stores, as well as on Lowes.com. We continue to enhance integrated design
        tools and ordering systems storewide in order for customers to envision
        projects, as well as to efficiently receive quotations and complete an
        order.

Special
        Order kiosks are available in departments such as appliances, walls/windows,
        lighting, millwork, hardware, building materials, seasonal living, fashion
        plumbing and tools for facilitating special orders in addition to what is
        made
        available on Lowes.com.

Whether
        t

hese
        kiosks are electronic or

literature-

based,
        all facilitate the ability of customers to view product pictures, and special
        order over a million products and parts.

Our
        flexible fulfillment initiative is intended to allow for faster and more
        efficient delivery of Special Order products to customers, while at the same
        time manage our inventory investment. Under this approach, certain items
        that do
        not have enough individual store demand to be economically stocked in all
        stores, but have sizeable demand across a group of stores, will be kept on
        hand
        in our distribution centers. This allows for fast shipment to our stores,
        or in
        some cases, direct shipment to a customer’s home. Our flexible fulfillment
        initiative allows us to balance quickly satisfying customers’ needs with a
        desire to minimize our inventory investment. We will continue to refine and
        enhance this fulfillment option in fiscal 2007.


Commercial
        Business Customers

Growth
        in
        sales to Commercial Business Customers remained strong in fiscal 2006. Our
        focus
        is to continue offering exceptional service to construction, residential
        property management, and business maintenance customers. Because we understand
        that time is money for these businesses, we continue to focus on ways to
        tailor
        our product and service offerings for these customers to quickly find what
        they
        need, when they need it.

In
        order
        to enable Commercial Business Customers to quickly access the products they
        need, our stores are merchandised with high-volume, take-with product
        appropriate for the season. We continue to evaluate and expand our contractor
        packs, which are economical quantities of the items Commercial Business
        Customers use most. In addition, Commercial Business Customers can phone
        or fax
        their orders in advance for pickup the same day or the next day, depending
        on
        the time of day the order is placed. For added convenience, we deliver to
        job
        sites seven days a week in most areas. We want to be a valued business partner
        to Commercial Business Customers, so we ensure our LowesForPros.com site
        features up-to-date articles, job estimators and business forms, e-newsletters,
        statistics and other vital information that Commercial Business Customers
        can
        use for their business.

e-Commerce

Our
        multi-channel capabilities enable customers to buy at the store or online.
        Lowes.com is an information and e-Commerce destination for customers around
        the
        world. Our site facilitates customers researching, comparing and buying Lowe’s
        products and services

wherever
        and whenever they desire. We of

fer
        how-to and buying guides online to help customers make smarter, more informed
        buying decisions and to empower them in their home improvement projects.
        We also
        offer customers the ability to check product availability at their local
        store
        and our direct-ship facilities, and offer store pick-up and hassle-free returns
        regardless of where the product was purchased. As more and more people are
        using
        the internet to research the products they want, we continue to add content
        to
        our site and enhance our merchandise selection to meet their needs. We remain
        committed to the internet as a channel for future growth.

Everyday
        Low Prices

Our
        customers do not have to wait for a sale to find a great value. We offer
        low
        prices every day. Our promise to customers is that if they find a lower everyday
        or advertised price on an identical stock product at a local competitor,
        we will
        not just match that price, but we will beat it by 10%.

Credit
        Financing

We
        offer
        a proprietary credit card for retail customers. In fiscal 2006, we launched
        Lowe’s Project Card in all stores. Lowe’s Project Card provides a major project,
        in-store financing solution to complement our Lowe’s Customer Revolving Credit
        Card. Lowe’s Project Card provides consumers an APR as low as 7.99% (ranging
        from 7.99% to 17.99%), credit lines up to $30,000 with repayment terms from
        months to 120 months, and low fixed monthly payments. A project window allows
        customers to purchase with no payments or interest accrual for a six-month
        period after the first purchase.

We
        feature proprietary credit programs for Commercial Business Customers. These
        programs include a Lowe’s Business Account, which is ideal for small- to
        medium-size businesses and offers minimum monthly payments; and Lowe’s Accounts
        Receivable, which is ideal for medium- to large-size businesses that pay
        in full
        each month.

In
        addition, we accept Visa®, MasterCard®, Discover® and American Express® credit
        cards, as well as debit cards.

Self-Checkout

To
        meet
        customer expectations for convenience at all levels of the shopping experience,
        we have self-checkout in approximately 400 of our stores. All product types
        and
        quantities are permitted, most tender types are accepted and the customer
        interface is bi-lingual. Our plan for fiscal 2007 is to add self-checkout
        to
        over 250 additional stores, which includes stores that will be remerchandised
        as
        well as all new stores.


Our
      Products

A
        typical
        Lowe's home improvement store stocks approximately 40,000 items,

with
        hundreds of thousands of

items
        available through our Special Order Sales system. Each store carries a wide
        selection of national brand name merchandise such as KitchenAid®, Samsung,
        Whirlpool®, Pella®, Werner®, Kohler®, DeWalt®, John Deere, Troy-Bilt®,
        Jenn-Air®, Bosch®

and
        many

more.
        Our merchandise selection provides the DIY retail, DIFM and Commercial Business
        Customer a one-stop shop for products needed to complete home improvement,
        repair, maintenance or construction projects. See page 42

of
        Lowe’s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders for the table summarizing sales by
        product category for each of the last three fiscal years.

Lowe’s
        Exclusives

In
        many
        product categories, customers look for a brand they know and trust to instill
        confidence in their purchase. To further differentiate our offering, we carry
        many brands that are exclusive to Lowe’s. These unique brands cover several
        categories like paint, lighting, flooring, walls/windows, tools

and
        more, and

give our
        customers superior performance and results. Exclusive brand names such as
        Premier Living™, Kobalt®, Portfolio®, Harbor Breeze®,

Reliabilt®,
        Perfect Flame™ and

Top-Choice® Lumber are found only at Lowe’s.

We
        continue to cultivate and create strategic alliances with our vendor partners
        in
        an effort to enhance our market share where such partnerships are advantageous
        to the customer, our Company and our vendors. We are also concentrating on
        increasing the electronic exchange of item and order information with our
        vendors, improving data integrity and reducing errors, leading to fewer returns
        and order changes and a better overall customer experience.

Product
        Sourcing

We
        source
        our products from approximately 7,000 merchandise vendors worldwide, with
        no
        single vendor accounting for more than five percent of total purchases.
        Management believes that alternative and competitive suppliers are available
        for
        virtually all our products. Where product specifications and customer
        preferences permit, we purchase directly from foreign manufacturers,
        avoiding third-party importers. This provides savings for our customers and
        both
        brand building and gross margin improvement opportunities for Lowe’s.

Distribution
        Network

To
        efficiently move product from our vendors to our stores and maintain in-stock
        levels, we own and operate 11 highly-automated regional distribution centers
        (RDCs). The RDCs are strategically located in North Carolina (2), Georgia
        (1),
        Indiana (1), Pennsylvania (1), Texas (1), California (1), Ohio (1), Florida
        (1),
        Connecticut (1), and Wyoming (1). On average, each RDC serves 126 stores.
        We
        expect to open additional RDCs in Rockford, Illinois, and Lebanon, Oregon,
        in
        fiscal 2007, and are planning for an additional RDC in fiscal 2008.

We
        also
        operate 13 flatbed distribution centers to distribute merchandise that requires
        special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber, boards,
        panel
        products, irrigation pipe, vinyl sidings, ladders and building materials.
        We own
        12 of these flatbed distribution centers, and we lease one flatbed distribution
        center. We expect to open two additional flatbed distribution centers in
        fiscal
        2007.

We
        also
        operate four facilities to support our import business, Special Order Sales,
        and
        internet fulfillment. We own two of these facilities, and we lease two of
        these
        facilities. In addition, we utilize two third-party transload facilities.
        These
        facilities do not hold inventory, but are the first point of receipt for
        imported products. The transload facilities sort and allocate products to
        RDCs
        based on individual store demand and forecasts.

On
        average in fiscal 2006, nearly 70% of the stock merchandise we purchased
        was
        shipped through our distribution network, while the remaining portion was
        shipped directly to stores from our vendors. In the fourth quarter of fiscal
        2006, we reached nearly 75%.

        radio, newspaper, magazine, direct mail, sponsorships, internet, and in-store
        programs all play a critical role in helping us reach customers. Each marketing
        initiative is based on understanding customers in terms of demographics,
        needs,
        expectations, insights and beliefs as these relate to the home, home improvement
        and business.

Broadcast
        - Television, Radio

We
        continued to utilize national television to build brand awareness and
        positioning. We supplemented our national broadcast advertising in key markets
        with local television and radio.

National
        radio was used to support major promotional events throughout the year, in
        particular during key holiday weekends like the Fourth of July. We also
        continued to foster relationships with

cable
        network partners such as HGTV (Home and Garden Television), BET (Black
        Entertainment Television) and Univision.


Print
      - Newspaper, Magazine

We
        implemented an enhanced print plan in fiscal 2006 that included national
        magazine advertising and ROP (Run of Press) newspaper ads. Circulars remained
        a
        critical avenue for reaching customers with our Everyday Low Price message
        and
        wide product and service selection.

Direct
        to Consumer

In
        fiscal
        2006, we continued to refine programs to respond to the changing needs and
        lifestyles of consumers. Through innovative database technology, we created
        direct mail campaigns based on precise criteria such as purchase activity,
        affinity group memberships, home purchases and sales, household demographics
        and
        even regional weather patterns

.

Additionally,
        an opt-in e-mail program links up with Lowe’s affinity groups, including
        subscribers to our bi-monthly magazine

Lowe’s
        Creative Ideas

®,
        as
        well as members of Lowe’s Woodworkers Club, Lowe’s Garden Club and Team Lowe’s
        Racing Fan Club. This fosters an ongoing relationship with customers even
        when
        they are not in a Lowe’s store.

Multicultural
        Marketing

We
        continued to produce marketing and communications designed to reach specific
        cultural segments, including the growing number of Hispanic and African-American
        home improvement consumers. Print, direct mail, point-of-purchase materials
        and
        television are just a few of the channels through which we communicated with
        these consumer groups. To make shopping easier for Hispanic customers, we
        continued to expand bi-lingual store signage.

At
        the
        end of fiscal 2006, nearly 78% of the stores had bi-lingual way-finding
        signage.

Team
        Lowe’s Racing

As
        one of
        the world’s fastest growing sports, NASCAR is an important part of building our
        brand. We are the proud sponsor of Jimmie Johnson, the 2006 NASCAR Nextel® Cup
        Series champion, and the #48 car, the #5 car in the Busch® Series, and Lowe’s
        Motor Speedway. We also host hospitality events at various sites throughout
        the
        racing season, leveraging and further building membership in the Team Lowe’s
        Racing Fan Club. In 2006, we continued to foster our relationship with Adrian
        Fernandez, who drove in several NASCAR Busch® Series races for Lowe’s. In
        addition, we teamed up with Adrian Fernandez and Fernandez Racing to field
        the
        #12 car in the 14-race Grand American Rolex Sports Car series.

Reaching
        Out

We
        believe community involvement extends beyond the boundaries of our stores.
        Following are some examples of how we are partnering with respected
        organizations to make a difference in communities and homes across
        America.

Habitat
        for Humanity

Lowe’s
        is
        a national partner with Habitat for Humanity International, helping provide
        safe, affordable housing for thousands of working families. Lowe’s contributed
        more than $5 million to Habitat projects in 2006 and Lowe’s employee volunteers
        gave hands-on support at home sites coast-to-coast to help Habitat families
        build their dreams.

Lowe's
        is
        also the national underwriter of Habitat for Humanity's Women Build program,
        empowering women volunteer teams in the construction of Habitat homes. The
        volunteers in this program built more than 50 homes in 2006.

American
        Red Cross

As
        a
        national Disaster Relief partner with the American Red Cross, Lowe’s made it
        easier for the Red Cross chapters to respond to disasters such as floods
        and
        tornadoes with much-needed supplies from local stores. We also worked
        side-by-side with the Red Cross at hurricane fairs along the Gulf and East
        coasts. In 2006, Lowe’s contributed more than $500,000 to the American Red
        Cross, including customer and employee donations.

The
        Home Safety Council

Founded
        by Lowe's in 1993, The Home Safety Council is a nonprofit organization with
        a
        vision of creating safer American homes. In 2006, we, along with our vendors,
        helped reach thousands of children and families with vital safety
        information.

Lowe’s
        Charitable and Educational Foundation

Founded
        in 1957, the Lowe's Charitable and Educational Foundation (LCEF) has a long
        and
        proud history of contributing to grassroots community projects. LCEF's primary
        philanthropic focus areas include community and public school improvement
        projects, safe and affordable housing, and education scholarships. LCEF provides
        funding only to

501(c)(3)
        organizations in communities where we operate stores or distribution centers.
        In
        2006, LCEF awarded more than $15 million for community improvement projects
        and
        K-12 public school initiatives.


Lowe’s
        Heroes

Lowe's
        Heroes employee volunteers tackle local problems in their communities. In
        2006,
        Lowe’s stores worked with representatives from nonprofit organizations and
        concerned individuals from their communities to help improve schools, build
        Habitat for Humanity homes or address safety issues—making their communities
        better places to live.

Lowe’s
        Employee Relief Fund

Lowe's
        Employee Relief Fund is dedicated to distributing emergency funds to our
        employees who face financial hardships due to natural disasters, house fires
        or
        illness.

The
        Company matches employee donations to the Fund.  Since 1999, Lowe’s
        Employee Relief Fund has assisted more than 4,000 employees with more than
        $5
        million in funds.

Our
        Market

We
        estimate the size of the U.S. home improvement market to be approximately
        $725
        billion annually, $560 billion of product demand, and $165 billion of installed
        labor opportunity.  Data from a variety of primary and secondary sources,
        including trade associations, government publications, industry participants
        and
        other sources was analyzed as the basis for our estimate. This estimate includes
        import and export data and key end-use markets, such as residential repair
        and
        remodeling, and nonresidential construction and maintenance.  This data
        also includes a wide range of categories relevant to our business, including
        major appliances and garden supplies.

As
        we
        continue to monitor economic data and the home improvement marketplace, there
        are many indicators demonstrating continued strength in consumer demand for
        the
        products and services we offer. The key indicators we monitor include personal
        income, employment growth, housing turnover and home ownership levels.
        Demographic and societal trends also remain supportive of home improvement
        industry growth.

§

Personal
                disposable income continues to grow, which is supported by data from
                the
                March 2007 Blue Chip Economic Indicators™, which forecasts real disposable
                income growth of 3.3% for calendar 2007, compared with 2.6% for
                calendar 2006.

§

Employment
                growth is a strong indicator of home improvement sales. The historically
                low unemployment rate of 4.5% suggests Americans will likely be more
                confident in calendar 2007 about employment prospects than in the
                past
                several years.

§

Housing
                turnover has slowed from the record pace of calendar 2005, according
                to
                The National Association of Realtors®, but the most recent data suggests
                encouraging signs of stabilization in housing turnover in calendar
                2007.

§

Near
                record U.S. homeownership levels provide an established customer
                base for
                home maintenance and repair projects. The vast majority of our customers
                are homeowners and they are not willing to let what is often their
                most
                valuable financial asset deteriorate.

The
        home
        improvement retailing business includes many competitors. We compete with
        a
        number of traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical and home supply retailers,
        as well as other chains of warehouse home improvement stores and lumberyards
        in
        most of our trade areas. In addition, we compete, with respect to some of
        our
        products, with discount stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs and online
        retailers. The principal competitive factors are customer service, location,
        price, product and brand selection, and name recognition.

Information
        Systems

We
        are
        continuously assessing and upgrading our information systems in an effort
        to
        support growth, augment new sales initiatives, control costs and enable better
        decision-making. During the last several years, we have made a substantial
        investment in developing and purchasing new computer systems.

We
        have a
        point-of-sale system, electronic bar code scanning system, various design
        systems, a wired and wireless network, and dual UNIX servers in each of our
        stores. These systems provide the stores with real-time perpetual inventory
        information, support all in-store selling, provide labor management, and
        provide
        support for a variety of store administrative functions. In addition, these
        store systems provide the customer support center functions, including inventory
        replenishment, finance, human resources and merchandising with information
        needed to support the stores. Store information is communicated to the customer
        support center's central computers via a terrestrial based (MPLS) network
        with
        back-up provided by a satellite-based wide area network. These corporate
        systems
        provide customer checkout with automated credit card and check approval,
        host a
        variety of centralized design and specialty order systems for the stores,
        provide store-based perpetual inventory information, provide sales performance
        reporting, and support accurate processing of all store sales transactions.
        In
        addition to the store and corporate office computing infrastructure, we also
        have significant computing capacity at each RDC to support these highly
        automated facilities.


Index

We
        have
        invested significant resources to safeguard sensitive employee and customer
        information. We work closely with industry standards groups to incorporate
        security best practices into our technology environment. Our state-of-the-art
        data center provides many additional fail-safe features to improve system
        availability and mitigate risks associated with unplanned outages. We expect
        to
        open a second Lowe’s owned and operated data center in fiscal 2007. This
        facility will allow us to in-source our current disaster recovery capabilities
        and provide more robust capabilities to support our future growth.

Employees

As
        of
        February 2, 2007, we employed approximately 157,000 full-time and 53,000
        part-time employees, none of which are covered by collective bargaining
        agreements. Management considers its relations with its employees to be
        good.

Item
        1A. - Risk Factors

We
        are
        exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Most are general risks and
        uncertainties applicable to all retailers, but some are more particular to
        retailers serving the home improvement industry. Our operations may also
        be
        affected by factors that are either not currently known to us or which we
        currently consider immaterial to our business. We describe below some of
        the
        specific known factors that could negatively affect our business, financial
        condition and results of operations. All forward-looking statements made
        by us
        in this Annual Report to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K,
        in
        our Annual Report to Shareholders and in our subsequently filed quarterly
        and
        current reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as in
        our
        press releases and other public communications, are qualified by the risks
        described below.

Our
        sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general
        economy.

General
        economic factors and other conditions, both domestically and internationally,
        may adversely affect the United States, the global economy and our financial
        performance, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism, developments
        in
        the war against terrorism in Asia and the Middle East, natural disasters,
        increasing fuel and energy costs, inflation or deflation of commodity prices,
        recession, consumer debt levels and the volatility of financial
        markets.

Adverse
        changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may
        negatively impact the rate of growth of our net sales and comparable store
        sales.

Sales
        of
        many of our product categories and services are driven by housing turnover
        and
        activity level of home improvement projects. Many of those sales are to
        consumers who are either doing the home improvement projects themselves or
        using
        our installation services, but many others are to professionals who are in
        the
        business of providing construction, renovation, and property maintenance
        services. Rising interest-rates, reduction in the availability of credit,
        increased heating and gas expenses, slowing housing turnover and slowing
        home-price appreciation could limit consumers’ discretionary spending or affect
        their confidence level and lead to reduced spending on home improvement
        projects. The impact of these economic factors specific to the home improvement
        industry would be exacerbated by a weak job market.

Unseasonable
        weather and adverse weather conditions can negatively affect our net sales
        and
        comparable store sales.

Wet
        and
        cold weather, particularly during the spring and early summer months of the
        year
        when many of the products we sell are designed for outdoor use, are generally
        detrimental to our sales and can make it difficult to sell seasonal merchandise.
        Although the impact of adverse weather conditions is mitigated by the geographic
        dispersion of our stores, unseasonable weather is a risk to the performance
        of
        our business in any given season or year.

Our
        store expansion and relocation strategy depends upon our ability to successfully
        open, relocate and operate new stores each year.

Our
        growth in net sales depends to a substantial degree on successfully and
        cost-effectively implementing our ongoing, aggressive expansion program.
        We must
        adapt our merchandising, marketing and distribution initiatives to new markets,
        both domestically and, going forward, in Canada and Mexico. We also plan
        to
        increase the number of our stores in markets in which we currently operate.
        Our
        ability to open additional stores depends, in large measure, upon our ability
        to
        locate and acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local land use and
        other
        regulations restricting the construction of buildings in the formats with
        which
        we operate may affect our ability to open new stores in some markets. As
        we
        develop more new stores in metropolitan markets, we may incur increased costs
        to
        remediate environmental pollution on some of the sites we are redeveloping
        that
        was caused by previous owners of those sites. Increased real estate,
        construction and development costs could also limit our growth opportunities.
        Our ability to continue to expand our operations depends also on our ability
        to
        attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees. If
        we are
        unable to


open
        new
        stores at the rate we currently plan to do so and staff them with qualified
        employees, the growth in our sales and our competitive position could be
        adversely affected.

If
        we
        fail to hire, train and retain qualified managers, sales associates and other
        employees we could lose sales to our competitors.

Customers’
        perceptions of the quality of service provided by employees can determine
        any
        retailer’s success or failure. Competition for qualified store managers and
        sales associates among retailers in the home improvement retailing business
        is
        intense, and if we fail to attract, train and retain qualified managers and
        sales associates our financial performance could be adversely impacted.
        Consumers shopping for goods and services for home improvement projects expect
        to have sales associates serving them who are knowledgeable about product
        categories located throughout our stores.

Excessive
        turnover, which has historically been high among employees in entry-level
        or
        part-time positions, increases the risk that sales associates will not have
        the
        training and experience needed to provide competitive, high quality customer
        service.

Our
        Commercial Business Customers demand a higher level of customer service that
        is
        challenging to meet on a consistent basis.

Commercial
        Business Customers in the home improvement industry expect to have their
        business handled by commercial sales specialists with an even greater depth
        of
        knowledge about the products these customers need. If we fail to staff our
        commercial sales desks with experienced and knowledgeable employees, we run
        the
        risk that we will lose Commercial Business Customers.

We
        have many competitors, who, if we fail to execute our merchandising, marketing
        and distribution strategies effectively, could take sales and market share
        from
        us.

We
        operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and
        services and have numerous large and small, direct and indirect competitors.
        The
        principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores,
        price
        and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment
        and
        presentation, and customer service. Our failure to respond effectively to
        competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could affect our
        financial performance. Moreover, unanticipated changes in the pricing and
        other
        practices of our competitors, including the effects of competitor liquidation
        activities, may impact our expected results.

An
        unusual number of product liability or breach of warranty claims for defective
        products could expose us to expensive claims and damage our standing with
        our
        customers.

We
        are
        exposed to product liability and product warranty claims relating to the
        products we sell that could adversely affect our financial condition, results
        of
        operations and cash flows. Because we do not have direct control over the
        quality of products manufactured or supplied to us by our vendors and because
        we
        self-insure for such product liability and warranty claims, we are exposed
        to
        risks relating to the quality of such products. Product liability claims
        can be
        expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other
        personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Claims
        of
        this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in the
        products we stock and in our reputation.

Our
        financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical
        information systems or if those systems are seriously disrupted.

An
        important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies, cost reductions, and
        sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of
        improvements to our management information systems to improve operations
        such as
        inventory replenishment systems, merchandise ordering, transportation, and
        receipt processing. Our financial performance could be adversely affected
        if our
        management information systems are seriously disrupted or we are unable to
        improve, upgrade, maintain, and expand our systems.

If
        the domestic and international supply chain for the products we stock is
        disrupted, our sales and gross margin would be adversely impacted.

We
        source
        the approximately 40,000 products we stock and sell from approximately 7,000
        domestic and international vendors. We source many of those products directly
        from foreign manufacturers. Political or financial instability among suppliers,
        trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates and transport capacity
        and
        costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if
        they
        seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply
        chain.

Our
        inability to effectively manage our relationships with selected suppliers
        of
        brand name products could negatively impact our ability to differentiate
        ourselves from competitors.

Part
        of
        our expansion strategy includes continued differentiation from competitors.
        To
        better distinguish our product offering, we form strategic relationships
        with
        selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized
        and respected brand names. The inability to effectively and efficiently manage
        the relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business
        plan
        and financial results.

        primarily to serve smaller markets. Both prototypes include a lawn and garden
        center, averaging an additional 31,000 square feet for 117K locations and
        26,000
        square feet for 94K locations. Of the total stores operating at February
        2,
        2007, approximately 86% are owned, which includes stores on leased land,
        with
        the remainder being leased from unaffiliated third parties. Approximately
        50% of
        our store leases are capital leases. We also own and operate 11 RDCs and
        flatbed distribution centers for lumber and building commodities. We lease
        and
        operate one flatbed distribution center. We also operate four facilities
        to
        support our import business, special order sales, and internet fulfillment.
        We
        own two of these facilities, and we lease two of these facilities. In addition,
        we utilize two third-party transload facilities. These facilities do not
        hold
        inventory, but are the first point of receipt for imported products. We own
        our
        executive offices, which are located in Mooresville, North Carolina. We also
        own
        and maintain offices in Wilkes County, North Carolina.

Lowe's
        common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The ticker
        symbol
        for Lowe's is “LOW”. As of March 23, 2007, there were 31,770 holders of record
        of Lowe's common stock. The table, "Lowe's Quarterly Stock Price Range and
        Cash
        Dividend Payment", on page 44

of the
        2006 Lowe’s Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended February 2,
        2007 sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices
        per
        share of the common stock as reported by the NYSE Composite Tape and the

        periods.

In
        January 2005, the Board of Directors approved a program under which the Company
        was authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of the Company’s common stock

- Controls and Procedures

The
          Company's management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer
          and
          Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s
“disclosure controls and procedures”, (as such term is defined in
          Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
          amended, (the “Exchange Act”)). Based upon their evaluation, the Chief Executive
          Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the
          period
          covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
          effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to
          be
          disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange
          Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) (1) is recorded,
          processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
          SEC’s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to the
          Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial
          officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
          disclosure.

In
          addition, based on that evaluation, no change in the Company’s internal control
          over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal fourth quarter ended
          February 2, 2007 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
          to
          materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s
          report on internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined
          in
          Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) and the attestation report of Deloitte
          & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm,
          on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting are
          included in Lowe’s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders on pages 26

and

          the headings, “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”
and “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,” respectively, and

We

        subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of February 2, 2007 and February 3, 2006, and

        management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control
        over financial reporting as of February 2, 2007, and the effectiveness of
        the
        Company's internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2007,
