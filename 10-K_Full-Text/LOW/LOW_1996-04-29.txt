         in the definitive Proxy Statement which was filed, pursuant to 
         regulation 14A with the SEC on April 16, 1996, and is hereby 
         incorporated by reference.

         The Company's Executive Compensation Program is comprised of the 
         following elements:

Base Salary

     Salaries for Executive Officers are established on the basis of the 
qualifications and experience of the executive, the nature of the job 
responsibilities and salaries for competitive positions in the 
retailing industry.

     Executive Officers' base salaries are reviewed annually and are 
approved by the Committee.  Salaries of Executive Officers are compared with 
those of comparable executive positions in the retailing industry throughout 
the United States.  The Committee uses the median level of base salary as a 
guideline, in conjunction with the executive's performance and qualifications, 
for establishing salary levels.

1994 Incentive Plan

     The purpose of the 1994 Incentive Plan is to attract, motivate, retain 
and reward the executives whose leadership and performance are critical to the 
Company's success in enhancing shareholder value, to place further emphasis on 
executive ownership of Company Stock and to assure deductibility of executive 
compensation.
     

     The 1994 Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of stock options.  The 
option price cannot be less than the market price of the Company's Common 
Stock on the date on which the option is granted.  Consequently, stock options 
granted under the 1994 Incentive Plan measure performance and create 
compensation solely on the basis of the appreciation in the price of the 
Company's Common Stock.

     Stock appreciation rights (STARs) also may be granted under the 1994 
Incentive Plan.  STARs entitle the recipient to receive a cash payment based 
on the appreciation in the Company's Common Stock following the date of the 
award and, accordingly, measure performance and create compensation only if 
the price of the Company's Common Stock appreciates.  



     Company Common Stock also may be issued under stock awards pursuant to 
the 1994 Incentive Plan.  The stock awards that have been made to date provide 
that the shares are subject to forfeiture and nontransferable for seven years 
following the award.  Accelerated vesting is permitted if the Company achieves 
certain financial objectives during the three- and five-year periods following 
the award.

     The Management Bonus Program is the final component of the 1994 Incentive
Plan.  The Management Bonus Program provides bonus opportunities which can be 
earned upon achievement by the Company of preset annual financial goals.  No 
bonuses are paid if performance is below the threshold level of corporate 
profitability.  Additional bonus amounts are earned on a proportionate scale 
up to 100% of the stated bonus opportunity if the preset financial goals are 
met.  Maximum bonuses were paid for the fiscal years ended January 31, 1994 
and January 31, 1995, because the Company's financial results exceeded the 
preset performance goals. A partial bonus equal to 25.669% of the basic bonus 
opportunity was paid for the year ended January 31, 1996, because financial 
results exceeded the minimum performance threshold but were below the goals 
established for full bonus payment.  


Benefit Restoration Plan

     The Benefit Restoration Plan was adopted by the Company in May 1990, to
provide qualifying executives with benefits equivalent to those received by 
all other employees under the Company's basic qualified employee benefit 
plans.  Qualifying executives are those executives whose annual additions and 
other benefits, as normally provided to all participants under those qualified 
plans, would be curtailed by the effect of Internal Revenue Code 
restrictions,and who are selected by the Committee to participate in the Plan.
The Benefit Restoration Plan benefits are determined annually.  Participating 
executives may elect annually to defer benefits or to receive a current cash 
payment.

Other Compensation

     The Company's Executive Officers participate in the various qualified and 
non-qualified employee benefit plans sponsored by the Company.  The Company 
makes only nominal use of perquisites in compensating its Executive Officers.


Item 12 -	Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management

     Reference is made to "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
Management" included in the definitive Proxy Statement which was filed 
pursuant to regulation 14A, with the SEC on April 16, 1996, and is hereby

of the Board", "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" included in 
the definitive Proxy Statement which was filed, pursuant to regulation 14A, 
with the SEC on April 16, 1996, and is hereby incorporated by reference.
