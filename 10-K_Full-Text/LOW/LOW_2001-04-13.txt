                                 Part I

Item 1 - Business

General

     Lowe's Companies, Inc. (Lowe's) is the second largest retailer of home
improvement products in the world, with a specific emphasis on retail do-it-
yourself (DIY) and commercial business customers.  Lowe's specializes in
offering products and services for home improvement, home decor, home
maintenance, home repair and remodeling and maintenance of commercial
buildings.  As of February 2, 2001, Lowe's operated 650 stores in 40 states
from coast to coast with approximately 67.8 million square feet of retail
selling space.

     Lowe's was incorporated in North Carolina in 1952 and has been a
publicly held company since 1961.  Lowe's common stock is listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, the Pacific Stock Exchange, and the London Stock
Exchange, with shares trading under the ticker symbol "LOW." Lowe's general
offices are located in Wilkesboro, North Carolina.

     Lowe's has one reportable industry segment - the operation of home
improvement retail stores.  Therefore, see Item 6 "Selected Financial Data"
for the historical data of revenues, profits and identifiable assets of the
Company.

Store Expansion

     Lowe's is continuing to maintain an aggressive growth strategy.  Lowe's
current prototype store has a 121,000 square foot sales floor with an
attached lawn and garden center comprising approximately 30,000 additional
square feet.  Lowe's 2001 expansion plan calls for opening 115 to 120 stores
(including the relocation of 12 older, smaller format stores).  The following
table illustrates the growth of the Company over the last three years.

                                             2000     1999     1998

   Number of stores, beginning of year        576      520      477

   Number of stores, end of year              650      576      520

     In 1998, the Company began a major expansion into the western United
States.  The Company opened 18 stores in the west during fiscal 2000, with an
additional 29 planned in 2001.  Additionally, in 1999, the Company completed
a merger with Eagle Hardware & Garden which added 41 stores in the western
United States, including both Alaska and Hawaii.

Customer Service

     Lowe's serves both retail and commercial business customers.  Retail
customers are primarily do-it-yourself homeowners and others buying for
personal and family use.  Commercial business customers include repair and
remodeling contractors, electricians, landscapers, painters, plumbers and
commercial and residential building maintenance professionals.  Each Lowe's
store caters to this broad array of customers by combining the merchandise,
sales and service of: a home fashions and interior design center; a lawn and
garden center; an appliance dealer; a hard goods discounter; a hardware
store; an air conditioning, heating, plumbing and electrical supply center;
and a building materials supplier.

     Lowe's is committed to providing superior customer satisfaction.
Customer expectations are being met by opening new stores in convenient
shopping locations; by supplying a large selection of high quality, in-stock
merchandise; by offering competitive everyday low prices and by providing
knowledgeable assistance, installation and special order services. If a
customer is searching for an item that is not carried in a store, it is
likely available through our special order system.  The Everyday Competitive
Price ("ECP") strategy guarantees the lowest price in the market and yet
builds profitability for Lowe's by substantially increasing revenues per
store.  ECP gives Lowe's customers the confidence to buy every day without
waiting for promotional sales.  Customer questions, problems, returns and
exchanges are handled at a convenient service desk near the main entrance of
the store.  Our customer-friendly return policy makes it simple to return or
exchange products.   Most of our stores have a separate lumber and building
materials cashier and loading area available for both DIY and commercial
business customers. Additionally, Lowe's offers specific services such as
installation (through subcontractors), delivery, loading, assembly, free how-
to clinics, wood and glass cutting, free kitchen design and a project desk to
assist Lowe's customers in planning their home improvement projects, no
matter how big or small.

     Lowe's offers two proprietary credit cards - one for individual retail
customers and the other for commercial business customers.  Lowe's commercial
business customers can also make purchases on credit by using Lowe's in-house
accounts.  In addition, Lowe's accepts Visa, MasterCard, Discover and
American Express credit cards.

Products

     A typical Lowe's home improvement warehouse stocks more than 40,000
items, with hundreds of thousands of items available through our special
order system.  Each store carries a wide selection of nationally advertised
brand name merchandise. The Company's merchandise selection is broad enough
to supply both the DIY retail and commercial business customer with
practically every item needed to complete any home improvement, repair,
maintenance or construction project.  See Note 14 on page 33 of the Annual
Report to Security Holders for fiscal year ended February 2, 2001 for the
table illustrating sales by product category for each of the last three
fiscal years.

     Excluding special order vendors, the Company sources its products from
approximately 7,000 merchandise vendors worldwide, with no single vendor
accounting for more than 4% of total purchases.  The Company is not dependent
upon any single vendor.  To the extent possible, the Company utilizes its
Global Sourcing Division to purchase directly from foreign manufacturers and
avoid third party importers.  Management believes that alternative and
competitive suppliers are available for virtually all its products, further
enhancing product quality and operating margins.

     In order to maintain appropriate inventory levels in stores and to
improve distribution efficiencies, the Company operates five highly
automated, efficient and state-of-the-art regional distribution centers
(RDC's).  The current RDC's are strategically located in North Carolina,
Georgia, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Texas.  Each Lowe's store is served by
one of these RDC's.  The Company also operates nine smaller support
facilities in order to distribute merchandise that requires special handling
due to size or type of packaging, such as lumber, various imports and
building materials.  Approximately 50% of the merchandise purchased by the
Company is shipped through its distribution facilities, while the remaining
portion is shipped directly to stores from vendors.  The Company is
constructing regional distribution centers in Perris, California, which is
expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2001, and in Findlay,
Ohio, which is expected to be operational in late 2001.

Marketing

     The Company reaches target customers through a mixture of television,
radio, direct mail, newspaper, event sponsorships, and in-store programs.
Each marketing initiative is based on understanding current and prospective
customers.  The Company has a strategic alliance with the HGTV network that
allows it to control a substantial portion of the airtime in which only the
Company's and its vendors' commercials are aired.  This is only one example
of how the Company solicits vendor participation in its advertising programs.
Additionally, the Company hosts customer hospitality events through its Team
31 Nascar sponsorship, supports the wide-ranging activities of Lowe's Home
Safety Council, and aggressively utilizes its proprietary credit programs to
drive customer traffic and purchases.

     In 2000, the Company continued to introduce or redefine programs that
respond to the changing needs and lifestyles of targeted customers.  Primary
to this effort is the Company's aggressive response to serve commercial
business customers.  The Company has responded to the special needs of this
customer group by carrying more professional brands, increasing in-stock
quantities for bigger jobs and testing various marketing approaches to win
the loyalty of commercial customers.  The Company currently has thirty
product categories available where customers can have installation arranged
through our stores.  In addition, kiosks (web based kiosks are currently
being tested) are available in departments such as appliances, home
decor/flooring, electrical/lighting, millwork, hardware, seasonal, plumbing
and tools for our customer's special product ordering.

Competition

     The home improvement retailing business is highly competitive. The
principal competitive factors are price, location, customer service, product
and brand selection, and name recognition.  The Company competes with a
number of traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical and home supply
retailers, as well as other chains of warehouse home improvement stores and
lumber yards in most of its market areas. In addition, the Company competes,
with respect to some of its products, with discount stores, mail order firms,
and warehouse clubs.

     Lowe's is the second largest retailer of home improvement products in
the world.  Due to the large number and variety of competitors, management is
unable to precisely measure the Company's market share in its existing market
areas.  However, Lowe's defines the market segments that it serves as DIY,
appliances, lawn & garden, home d,cor, repair/remodeling, specialty trade
contractor, and property management.  This total market is estimated to be
$400 billion of which Lowe's share is estimated to be approximately 5%.

Information Systems

     The Company is continuously assessing and upgrading its information
systems to support growth, to control costs, and to enable better decision-
making.  During the last six years, the Company has made a substantial
investment in developing and purchasing new computer systems.  Lowe's has a
point of sale system, electronic bar code scanning system, various design
systems and a UNIX Server in each of its stores.  Store information is
communicated to the support center's central computer via a terrestrial based
(frame relay) network with back up being provided by a satellite based wide
area network.  These systems provide efficient customer check-out with
automated credit card approval and store-based inventory management with
automatic replenishment orders.  In addition, the systems also provide labor
planning and item movement experience.  These computers supply the general
office functions with the information needed to support the stores.

Employees

     As of February 2, 2001, the Company employed approximately 77,000 full-
time and 17,000 part-time employees, none of which are covered by any
collective bargaining agreements.  Management considers its relations with
its employees to be good.

Item 2 -	Properties

     At February 2, 2001, the Company operated 650 stores with a total of 67.8
million square feet of selling space. The current prototype large store is a
121,000 square foot sales floor with a lawn and garden center comprising
approximately 30,000 additional square feet.  Of the total stores operating at
February 2, 2001, approximately 60% of the facilities are owned, with the
remainder being leased.  Approximately one-half of these leases are capital
leases. The Company also owns and operates five regional distribution centers
and nine smaller support facilities, four of which are reload centers for
lumber and building commodities.  The Company's general offices are located in
Wilkesboro, North Carolina and occupy several buildings, the majority of which
are owned.


Item 3 - Legal Proceedings

     The Company is a defendant in legal proceedings considered to be in the
normal course of business, none of which, singularly or collectively, are
considered material to the Company.


Item 4 - 	Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

     Not applicable.
