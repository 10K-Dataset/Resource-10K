================================================================================

Item 1.  Business

         Fiserv was formed on July 31,  1984,  through  the  combination  of two
major regional data processing firms located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Tampa,
Florida.  These  firms--First  Data  Processing of Milwaukee and Sunshine  State
Systems of Tampa--began their operations in 1964 and 1971, respectively,  as the
data processing operations of their parent financial institutions. Historically,
operations  were  expanded by  developing  a range of services  for these parent
organizations as well as other financial institutions.
         Since its  organization  in 1984,  the  Company  has grown  through the
continuing  development of highly specialized services and product enhancements,
the  addition of new  clients and the  acquisition  of firms  complementing  the
Fiserv organization.

Business Strategy

         The market for products and services offered by financial  institutions
continues to undergo change. New alternative lending and investment products are
being  introduced  and  implemented  by the industry with great  frequency;  the
distinctions among financial services  traditionally offered by savings and loan
associations,  banks  and  credit  unions  continue  to  narrow;  and  financial
institutions diversify and consolidate on an ongoing basis in response to market
pressures,  as well as under  the  auspices  of the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) and the Credit Union National Association (CUNA).
         Although  such market  changes  have led to  consolidations  which have
reduced  the  number  of  financial  institutions  in the  United  States,  such
consolidations  have not  resulted  in a  material  reduction  of the  number of
customer accounts serviced by the financial industry as a whole. New entrants to
the once limited financial  services industry have opened new markets for Fiserv
services.
         To  stay   competitive   in  this   changing   marketplace,   financial
institutions are finding they must  aggressively meet the growing needs of their
customers  for a broad  variety of new products and services  that are typically
transaction-oriented and fee-based. The growing volume and types of transactions
and  accounts  have  increased  the  data   processing   requirements  of  these
institutions.  As a consequence,  Fiserv management  believes that the financial
services  industry  has  become  one of the  largest  users  of data  processing
products and services.
         Moreover,  Fiserv  expects that the industry  will  continue to require
significant  commitments  of  capital  and human  resources  to the  information
systems requirements, to require application of more specialized systems, and to
require  development,  maintenance  and  enhancement of  applications  software.
Fiserv  believes  that  economies  of scale in data  processing  operations  are
essential to justify the required level of expenditures  and commitment of human
resources.
         In  response to these  market  dynamics,  the means by which  financial
institutions  obtain data processing services has changed.  Many smaller,  local
and  regional   third-party   data   processors  are  leaving  the  business  or
consolidating  with larger providers.  A number of large financial  institutions
previously providing third-party processing services for other institutions have
withdrawn from the business to concentrate  on their primary,  core  businesses.
Similarly,  an  increasing  number of  financial  institutions  that  previously
developed  their own software  systems and maintained  their own data processing
operations have outsourced their data processing requirements by licensing their
software from a third party or by  contracting  with  third-party  processors to
reduce costs and enhance their  products and services.  Outsourcing  can involve
simply the  licensing  of software,  thereby  eliminating  the costly  technical
expertise  within  the  financial  institution,  or the  utilization  of service
bureaus,  facilities  management  or  resource  management  capability.   Fiserv
provides all of these options to the financial industry.
         To  capitalize  on these  industry  trends  and to become  the  premier
national  provider  of  data  processing  products  and  services,   Fiserv  has
implemented a strategy of continuing to develop new products, improving the cost
effectiveness  of  services  provided to clients,  aggressively  soliciting  new
clients and making both opportunistic and strategic acquisitions.





Systems, Services and Products

         No  matter  what a  financial  institution  requires,  Fiserv  offers a
business-specific  solution  to  satisfy  its  needs--from  data  processing  to
specialized in-house processing systems to customized  outsourcing.  Within this
dynamic  relationship,  Fiserv  brings the  resources,  expertise  and technical
specialization  that gives an  institution  the security to focus its efforts on
reaching its strategic business goals.
         All Fiserv  products  and  services  are  designed to help clients meet
their ultimate goal:  giving their customers the best possible  service quickly,
accurately and completely.  Through their  relationship  with Fiserv,  financial
institutions  gain the tools to  enhance  and  expand  their  customer  service:
advanced  technology,  dependable  and  responsive  support,  product and system
flexibility, and value for their money.
         As a technology partner,  Fiserv offers data processing solutions based
on the  financial  institution's  requirements.  This  broad  base of  offerings
results in delivery  options  including  service bureau  capabilities;  in-house
software systems;  and strategic  technology  alliances including facilities and
resource  management  services.  A  host  of  financial  information  technology
products and services  complement  these delivery  methods:  item processing and
imaging technology  services;  backroom automation software systems;  electronic
funds  transfer  services;  plastic  cards and  other  related  card  management
services;   rate  risk  management   systems;   self-directed   retirement  plan
processing;  network  installation  and  integration  services;  human resources
outsourcing;  design and production of business forms and marketing  literature;
and delivery and support of leading third-party software and hardware products.


Comprehensive Service Dimension

         Fiserv  focuses on  providing  financial  data  processing  systems and
related  information  management  services and products to banks, credit unions,
mortgage banks,  savings institutions and other financial  intermediaries.  This
focus  allows the  Company to  concentrate  its  advanced  technology,  industry
experience,  research  and  development  on creating  and  supporting  solutions
uniquely designed for the financial  industry.  Based on market surveys of total
clients  served,  Fiserv is the nation's  leading  independent  data  processing
provider  for  banks and  savings  institutions;  the  leading  item  processing
provider  for banks and  savings  institutions  combined;  the  number  two data
processing  provider for credit unions;  and the number two software and service
provider for the mortgage industry.
         Many financial  institutions,  including banks, credit unions, mortgage
banks and  savings  institutions,  rely on Fiserv  data  center  service  bureau
solutions for their information  processing needs. These solutions offer clients
a choice of online systems compatible with their existing equipment. Fiserv data
centers focus on the  financial  institution's  needs within its local  business
climate,  helping to better serve the customer base and provide  quality service
at all points of customer contact.
         In-house  software  systems give clients a service delivery method that
enables them to process their own work.  These  solutions  offer clients a broad
array of  service  capabilities  to respond to  emerging  market  opportunities.
Specific to this Fiserv solution is the option of migrating  between in-house or
service bureau  delivery  approaches  without new software  conversion.  The end
result: a business alliance designed to help financial  institutions  respond to
their  customers  while  enabling  each  institution  to  select  its  preferred
operating environment.
         Strategic technology alliances offer financial  institutions the option
of full data processing management by Fiserv personnel on-site; or management of
their  systems at a Fiserv data  center.  Facilities  Management  brings  Fiserv
personnel to the client's site,  while Resource  Management  brings the client's
operations to one of the many Fiserv data processing or computer service centers
throughout  the United  States.  Both  solutions are designed to meet the unique
requirements  of the client by  partnering  to  minimize  operating  costs while
allowing each client to maintain control of its software applications.
         For  institutions  seeking to expand or enhance their mortgage  banking
capabilities,  Fiserv  offers  a  specialized  line  of  mortgage  products  and
services.  The  benefits  of  complete  PC  Windows(TM)-based   origination  and
secondary marketing solutions and online, real-time loan servicing solutions are
available to help clients effectively meet their mortgage banking needs.
         Offering  comprehensive item processing (IP) services to more financial
institutions  than any other external  provider,  Fiserv  maintains a network of
specialized,  regional  processing  centers  in  45  cities.  In a  field  where
efficiencies  are gained through  volume,  Fiserv is well positioned to leverage
its resources and technological expertise for the benefit of IP services clients
nationwide.   Other  item  processing   services  include:   proof  of  deposit,
inclearing,  statement rendering,  bulkfile,  lockbox, item research,  overdraft
processing,  qualified  returns  and return  items,  cash letter  deposit,  fine
sorting, account reconcilement and adjustments.
         A growing trend in check  operations is the use of imaging  technology.
Fiserv offers a full range of image integration products and services.  Included
are  image  and  document   management  systems  for  management,   storage  and
presentation of check and document images.
         Fiserv  is  among  the  nation's  leading   third-party   providers  of
electronic funds transfer (EFT) services,  providing transaction  authorization,
comprehensive  Automated  Teller Machine / Point-of-Sale  (ATM / POS) processing

coupled  with access to all major EFT  services  networks,  helps to keep Fiserv
clients competitive.
         As a leading  systems  integrator,  Fiserv  creates joint ventures that
combine core competencies in hardware, software, functional application systems,
networks,  data  management and end-user  computing,  along with dedicated human

portfolio of cash management  solutions includes electronic banking information,

         Fiserv backroom automation systems provide PC-based  productivity tools
that deliver the  software,  service and support  necessary to meet the customer
service  challenges facing the financial  industry.  The systems are designed to
streamline backroom operations by reducing time, keystrokes and labor.
         A full  range  of  human  resource,  benefit  and  payroll  information
services are available through Fiserv to help large organizations  enhance their
personnel  management  tasks.  Marketing   communications  and  a  comprehensive
financial business forms service,  including  communications  needs analysis and
complete project  management,  provide  assistance at all levels of planning and
implementation.  Concept, development and design of printed pieces, ranging from

Servicing the Market

         The  market  for Fiserv  data  processing  services  and  products  has
specific  needs and  requirements,  with  strong  emphasis  placed by clients on
software flexibility, product quality, reliability of service, comprehensiveness
and  integration  of product  line,  timely  introduction  of new  products  and
features,  and cost value.  Through its multiple product offerings,  the Company
successfully  services  these  market  needs for  clients  ranging  in size from
start-ups to some of the largest institutions worldwide.
         Fiserv   believes  that  the  position  it  holds  as  an  independent,
growth-oriented  company  dedicated  to  its  business  is an  advantage  to its
clients.  The  Company  differs  from  many  of the  data  processing  resources
currently  available  since it isn't a  regional  or local  cooperatively  owned
organization,  nor a data  processing  subsidiary,  an  affiliate of a financial
institution or a hardware  vendor.  Due to the economies of scale gained through
its broad market presence,  Fiserv offers clients a selection of data processing
solutions designed to meet the specific needs of financial institutions.
         The  Company  believes  this  independence  and  primary  focus  on the
financial industry helps its business development and related Client Service and
Product  Support  teams remain  responsive to the data  processing  needs of its
market, now and for the future.
         "The Client Comes First" is one of the Company's  founding  principles.
It's a belief backed by a dedication  to providing  ongoing  client  service and
support--no  matter the institution  size. The Fiserv Client Support and Account
Management staff is responsible for the day-to-day interface with the operations
of clients.
         The  Company's  commitment  of  substantial  resources  to training and
technical support helps keep Fiserv clients first.  Fiserv conducts the majority
of its new and ongoing  client  training in its data centers,  where the Company
maintains  fully  equipped  demonstration  and  training  facilities  containing
equipment  used in the delivery of Fiserv  services.  Fiserv also provides local
and on-site training services.

Product Development

         In order to meet the changing  data  processing  needs of the financial
institutions served by Fiserv, the Company continually  develops,  maintains and
enhances its systems.  Resources applied to product  development and maintenance
are believed to be  approximately 8% to 10% of Company  revenues,  about half of
which is dedicated to software development.
         Unique to  Fiserv,  its  network  of  development  and data  processing
centers applies the shared expertise of multiple Fiserv teams to design, develop
and  maintain  specialized  processing  systems  around the  leading  technology
platforms.   The  applications  of  its  account  processing  systems  meet  the
preferences  and diverse  requirements of the various  international,  national,
regional  or  local  market-specific   financial  service  environments  of  the
Company's many clients.
         Though all Fiserv  centers rely on the Company's  nationally  developed
and supported  software,  each center has specialized  capabilities  that enable
them to offer system  application  features and functions unique to their client
base.  Where  the  client's  requirements  warrant,  Fiserv  purchases  software
programs from third parties which are interfaced  with existing  Fiserv systems.
In developing its products,  Fiserv stresses  responsiveness to the needs of its
clients through close client contact.
         Fiserv provides a dedicated system designed, developed,  maintained and
enhanced  according  to  each  client's  goals  for  service  quality,  business
development,   asset/liability   mix,   local-market   positioning   and   other
user-defined parameters.

Competition

         The market for data  processing  services to banks,  credit  unions and
savings institutions is highly competitive.  The Company's principal competitors
include  internal data processing  departments,  data  processing  affiliates of
financial  institutions or large computer  hardware  manufacturers,  independent
computer  service  firms  and  processing  centers  owned and  operated  as user
cooperatives.  Fiserv competitors  include EDS, M&I, Bisys,  ALLTEL, ISSC (IBM),
Symitar  and  various  regional  firms.  Certain  of these  competitors  possess
substantially greater financial, sales and marketing resources than the Company.
Competition   from  in-house  data   processing  and  software   departments  is
intensified by the efforts of computer hardware vendors who encourage the growth
of internal data centers.
         Competitive  factors for processing  services  include product quality,
reliability  of service,  comprehensiveness  and  integration  of product  line,
timely  introduction  of new  products  and  features,  and price.  The  Company
believes that it competes  favorably in each of these  categories.  In addition,
the Company believes that its position as an independent vendor,  rather than as
a cooperative,  an affiliate of a financial institution or a hardware vendor, is
a competitive advantage.
         First Trust and Lincoln  Trust compete with a number of large and small
providers of retirement plan administration services.

Government Regulation

         The Company's data processing  subsidiaries are not themselves directly
subject to federal or state  regulations  specifically  applicable  to financial
institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions. As a provider of services
to these entities,  however,  the data  processing  operations are observed from
time to time by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation,  the National Credit
Union  Association,  the  Office  of  Thrift  Supervision,  the  Office  of  the
Comptroller  of the Currency and various  state  regulatory  authorities.  These
regulators make certain recommendations to the Company regarding various aspects
of  its  data  processing   operations.   Such   recommendations  are  generally
implemented by the Company. In addition,  the Company's  operations are reviewed
annually  by  an  independent  auditor  to  provide  required  internal  control
evaluations for its clients' auditors and regulators.
         As trust  companies  under  Colorado law, First Trust and Lincoln Trust
are subject to the regulations of the Colorado Division of Banking.  First Trust
and Lincoln Trust  historically have complied with such regulations and although
no assurance can be given,  the Company  believes  First Trust and Lincoln Trust
will  continue to be able to comply with such  regulations.  Commencing in 1991,
First Trust received  approval of its application for Federal Deposit  Insurance
Corporation coverage of its customer deposits.

Employees

         Fiserv  employs  8,590  specialists  throughout  the United  States and
worldwide in its information  management centers and related product and service
companies.  This service support network includes  employees with backgrounds in
computer science and the financial  industry,  often  complemented by management
and other direct experience in banks, credit unions, mortgage firms, savings and
other financial institution business environments.
         Fiserv  employees  provide  expertise in sales and  marketing;  account
management  and  client  services;  computer  operations,  network  control  and
technical  support;   programming,   software   development,   modification  and
maintenance; conversions and client training; and related support services.
         Fiserv employees are not represented by a union, and there have been no
work stoppages,  strikes or organizational  attempts.  The service nature of the
Fiserv business makes its employees an important  corporate asset, and while the
market for qualified  personnel is competitive,  the Company does not experience
difficulty with hiring or retaining its staff of top industry professionals.  In
assessing  companies to acquire,  the quality and  stability of the  prospective
company's staff are emphasized.
         Management attributes its ability to attract and keep quality employees
to, among other things, the Company's growth and dedication to  state-of-the-art
software development tools and hardware technologies.

Item 2.  Properties

         Fiserv currently  operates  full-service data centers,  software system

England;   Singapore;  and  Burlington,   Calgary,  Edmonton,  Halifax,  London,
Montreal,  Ottawa,  Regina, St.  Catherines,  Toronto,  Vancouver,  Victoria and
Winnipeg, Canada.
         The Company owns facilities in Brookfield,  Corvallis, Fresno, Hartford
and Lincoln;  all other  buildings  in which  centers are located are subject to
leases  expiring  through  1998 and  beyond.  The  Company  owns or  leases  129
mainframe  computers  (Data  General,  Digital,  Hewlett  Packard,  IBM, NCR and
Unisys). In addition,  the Company maintains its own national data communication
network consisting of communications processors and leased lines.
         Fiserv  believes  its  facilities  and  equipment  are  generally  well
maintained and are in good operating  condition.  The Company  believes that the
computer  equipment  it owns and its various  facilities  are  adequate  for its
present and foreseeable  business.  Fiserv  periodically  upgrades its mainframe
capability as needed. Fiserv contracts with multiple sites to provide processing
backup  in the  event  of a  disaster  and  maintains  duplicate  tapes  of data
collected and software used in its business in locations away from the Company's
facilities.
         Fiserv regards its software as  proprietary  and utilizes a combination
of trade secrecy law,  internal security  practices and employee  non-disclosure
agreements  for  protection.  The Company has not  patented  or  registered  the
copyrights on its software.  The Company  believes that legal  protection of its
software, while important, is less significant than the knowledge and experience
of the Company's management and personnel and their ability to develop,  enhance
and market new products and  services.  The Company  believes  that it holds all
proprietary rights necessary for the conduct of its business.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

         In the normal course of business,  the Company and its subsidiaries are
named as defendants in various lawsuits in which claims are asserted against the
Company.  In the  opinion of  management,  the  liabilities,  if any,  which may
ultimately result from such lawsuits are not expected to have a material adverse
effect on the financial statements of the Company.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

         During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report, no
matter was submitted to a vote of security holders of the Company.
