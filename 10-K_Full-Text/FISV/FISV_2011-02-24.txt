FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability
established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include those that express a plan, belief, expectation, estimation, anticipation, intent, contingency, future development or similar expression, and can
generally be identified as forward-looking because they include words such as “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “could,” “should” or words of similar meaning. Statements that describe our
objectives or goals are also forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this report involve significant risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors, both foreseen and unforeseen, that could cause actual results to differ
materially from our current expectations. The factors that may affect our results include, among others: the impact on our business of the current state of the economy, including the risk of reduction in revenue resulting from the elimination of
existing or potential clients due to consolidation or financial failures in the financial services industry or from decreased spending on the products and services we offer; legislative and regulatory actions in the United States, including the
impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and related regulations, and internationally; changes in client demand for our products or services; pricing or other actions by competitors; the potential impact of our
strategic initiatives; our ability to comply with government regulations, including privacy regulations; and other factors discussed in this report under the heading “Risk Factors.” You should consider these factors carefully in evaluating
forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring
after the date of this report. We are not including the information provided on the websites referenced herein as part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

PART I

In this report, all references to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Fiserv, Inc. (“Fiserv”), a
Wisconsin corporation, and, unless the context otherwise requires, its consolidated subsidiaries.

Item 1.
Business

Overview

Fiserv, Inc. is the leading global provider of financial services technology solutions, including electronic commerce systems and services such as transaction processing, electronic bill payment and
presentment, business process outsourcing, document distribution services, and software and systems solutions. Fiserv is a Fortune 500 company and is publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. We serve approximately 16,000 clients
worldwide, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants, and government agencies. The majority of the services we provide to our clients are non-discretionary in nature and
are necessary for our clients to operate their business. Our operations are principally located in the United States where we operate centers for full-service financial data and transaction processing, software system development, item processing
and check imaging, and technology support.

In 2010, we had $4.1 billion in total revenue and $958 million in net cash
provided by operating activities from continuing operations. Processing and services revenue, which in 2010 represented 83% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily generated from account and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally
have terms of three to five years. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, our international operations contributed 6%, 5% and 5% of total revenue, respectively, from Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, France, India, Indonesia, Luxembourg,
Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Poland, Singapore, and the United Kingdom.



Since we began, we have grown our business by developing highly specialized services and
product enhancements, adding new clients, and acquiring businesses that complement ours. In 2007, we acquired CheckFree Corporation (“CheckFree”), a leading provider of electronic commerce services and products, including electronic bill
payment and presentment and Internet banking. The acquisition was the largest in our history, has enabled us to deliver a wide range of integrated products and services, and has created new opportunities for growth.

We originally incorporated in Delaware in 1984, and reincorporated as a Wisconsin corporation in 1992. Our headquarters are located at
255 Fiserv Drive, Brookfield, Wisconsin 53045, and our telephone number is (262) 879-5000.

The Markets We Serve

General

The
market for products and services offered by financial institutions is experiencing continuous change. The financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment, deposit, lending, investment and risk management products, and the
distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same ultimate customers.

The growing volume and types of transactions and payment mechanisms have increased the data and transaction processing and other service
needs of financial institutions. We believe that financial institutions will be required to continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions and manage information in this rapidly evolving and competitive
environment. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive are essential to justify the required amounts of investments in capital and human
resources.

The number of financial institutions in the United States continues to decline as a result of the current state of
the economy as well as other market and regulatory pressures. Consolidation has not, however, resulted in a material reduction in the number of customers or financial accounts serviced by the financial industry as a whole. Our revenue is diversified
and our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation has on us. We have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset
size, and we typically enter into multi-year agreements. Our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25% of our annual revenue, and our remaining revenue is spread across the balance of our client base. Our largest client
represents approximately 6% of our annual revenue.

We anticipate that demand for products that facilitate electronic
transactions will continue to increase, which should translate to revenue opportunities for us. As a result, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring
revenue-based products and services gives us a solid foundation for growth. In addition, we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients. Our ongoing operations are reported in the
Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) and Financial Institution Services (“Financial”) business segments.

Payments

The
businesses in our Payments segment primarily provide electronic bill payment and presentment services and debit and other card-based payment products and services to meet the electronic transaction processing needs of the financial services
industry. Our businesses in this segment also provide Internet banking, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, card and print personalization services, and fraud and risk management products and services.



Financial

The businesses in our Financial segment provide financial institutions with the products and services they need to run their operations. Many financial institutions that previously developed their own
software systems and maintained their own data processing operations have outsourced their data processing requirements by licensing software from third-parties or by contracting with third-party processors. This has allowed them to reduce costs and
enhance their products and services. Outsourcing can involve the licensing of software, which reduces the need for costly technical expertise within a financial institution, or the utilization of service bureaus, facilities management or resource
management capabilities, which can enhance capacity and capabilities. Within the Financial segment, we provide banks, thrifts and credit unions with account processing services, item processing services, loan origination and servicing products, cash
management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions.

Our Strategy

Our vision is to be a global leader in transaction-based technology solutions. Our mission is to provide integrated
technology and services solutions which enable best-in-class results for our clients. We are focused on operating businesses where we have: deep industry expertise that enables us to serve the market with high effectiveness; a strong competitive
position, currently or via a clear path in the foreseeable future; long-term, trusted, ongoing client relationships which are not based on one-time transactions; differentiated solutions that deliver higher-than-normal value to our clients through
integration and innovation; and strong management to execute strategies in a disciplined manner. Consistent with this focus, we continue to execute the following strategic platforms:

Enhanced Client Relationship Value

. We plan to increase the number and breadth of our client relationships by, among other matters,
continuing to integrate our product and services groups, combining products and services to deliver improved value propositions, and streamlining our service and support processes.

Acquisitions

. We expect to acquire businesses when we identify: a compelling strategic need, such as a product, service or
technology that helps fill a specific market requirement; an opportunity to change market dynamics; a way to achieve business scale; or some similar consideration.

Innovation

. We seek to be an innovation leader in all of our key markets, leveraging our assets and capabilities to be at the forefront of our markets.

Operational Excellence

. We believe we can improve our performance by using the opportunities created by our size and scale. For
example, we are using our consolidated buying power and shared utility structures to provide cost savings.

Capital
Discipline

. Finally, we intend to make capital allocation decisions that offer the best prospects for our long-term growth and profitability, which may include, among other matters, internal investment, repayment of debt, repurchases of our own
shares, capital improvements or acquisitions.

Principal Solutions and Services

Financial information regarding our business segments is included in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements on page 52.

Payments

E-Banking

Our e-banking
business is comprised of our electronic bill payment and presentment services and our Internet banking and cash management products. Financial institutions can offer our bill payment services to consumers either through a hosted application or
through various protocols that link online banking applications



to our internal billing and payment system. These systems allow our clients’ customers to: manage household bills via an easy-to-use, online tool; view relevant billing and payment
information; pay and manage all of their bills at one location; experience the same speed of payment they would normally have at a biller’s site; and conveniently make next-day payments to many of the companies with which they do business. We
use our platform to process the vast majority of the payment transactions that we handle, which enables us to improve our economies of scale. Once a consumer has accessed the system through a financial institution, he or she can elect to pay an
electronic bill delivered by us or can instruct the system to pay any individual or company within the U.S. In 2010, we processed more than 1.4 billion online bill payment transactions.

Our principal online consumer and business banking product is
Voyager

®

, a software platform upon which we have built a number of software applications to support multiple
lines of banking businesses. Using universal standards, Voyager has been designed to be highly scalable to meet the evolving needs of our clients. This structure enables our clients to deploy new Internet-based financial services by adding
applications to our platform at any time and by integrating future applications to any Internet connected point-of-presence. Corillian Online

®

combines our electronic bill payment and online banking solutions into a fully integrated product that provides extensive personal money management and other valuable
tools. We also provide a series of treasury management solutions, including online business banking, commercial cash management, remote deposit, and corporate data exchange, under our BANKLINK

®

brand.

Our Mobile
Money

TM

product provides a variety of mobile banking and
payments services, including balance inquiry, transaction history, bill payment and transfers, through a mobile device to our clients and their customers. It enables financial institutions to reach more consumers via the mobile channel than any
other single technology solution because it supports all three mobile access modes: browser, text banking, and mobile application.

In 2010, we introduced ZashPay

®

, a person-to-person payments
service that enables the secure, electronic movement of money to and from bank accounts based in the U.S., typically within one to three business days. Using our existing bill payment network, a payment is originated directly from the sender’s
bank account and is transmitted directly into the recipient’s account, utilizing the same secure processes as an online banking transaction. ZashPay can be accessed through the websites of participating financial institutions as well as a
proprietary portal, www.ZashPay.com.

Biller Business

We believe that consumers will continue to shift their financial transactions from traditional paper-based methods to electronic methods if they have easy-to-access, easy-to-use, secure and cost-effective
methods of receiving and paying their bills electronically. In 2010, we delivered approximately 330 million electronic bills to consumers through our various distribution channels. Consumers access our electronic billing and payment solutions
via numerous hosted channels, including through a financial institution’s Internet portal, through the billers’ Internet sites, and through our biller services internet portals, the largest of which is www.mycheckfree.com. Additionally,
consumers can make bill payments, including emergency or expedited payments, through our agent-assisted, Internet or interactive voice response phone tools and at our nationwide walk-in bill payment locations. These diverse services allow the
customers of our clients to pay bills wherever and however they feel most comfortable. Furthermore, because our biller clients are able to receive all these services from Fiserv, we can eliminate the operational complexity and expense of supporting
multiple vendor solutions or in-house developed solutions. Our electronic biller services business also offers a host of club management and electronic financial transaction services within the health and fitness industry.

Card Services

Fiserv’s Card Services business, a leader in the electronic funds transfer marketplace, provides a total payments solution through a
variety of products and services. We offer ATM and point of sale PIN-based debit transaction processing, signature debit processing, ATM driving and monitoring, electronic benefits transfer



switching and national and regional network access. We own the
ACCEL/Exchange

®

network and operate approximately 20,000 ATMs. Comprehensive integration with our account
processing products and services allows us to drive down costs and leverage efficiencies for our clients through enterprise offerings in areas such as risk management and loyalty rewards. Our Card Services business’ clients include more than
4,200 banks and credit unions of all asset sizes, resellers (via both business alliance and remarketer agreements), independent sales organizations and merchant acquirers across the United States. In 2010, we processed over 8.8 billion ATM and debit
transactions, making us one of the largest financial transaction processors in the nation.

Our feature-rich credit products
and services fulfill a wide range of bank card, retail, commercial and consumer credit processing requirements through an integrated, full-service credit management solution that utilizes a globally recognized processing platform. Our credit
processing system provides credit decisioning, authorization processing, online cardholder account management, customer service case management, letters, card production, statements, targeted marketing programs, collections, and recovery management.

Output Solutions

Our output solutions business provides clients with: electronic document management through our electronic document delivery products and services; card manufacturing, personalization and mailing;
statement production and mailing; design and fulfillment of direct mail solutions; forms distribution; laser printing and mailing; and office supplies.

Investment Services

We provide a range of technology platforms and
software solutions which assist over 325 firms, including broker dealers, global asset managers, investment advisors, banks and insurance companies, to deliver portfolio management, enhanced trading solutions, performance measurement, reporting
services, corporate actions, billing, and trading automation to their clients. Our fee-based investment management clients are typically sponsors or managers in the managed accounts and wealth management market that offer separately managed
accounts, unified managed accounts, mutual fund advisory accounts, and investment management products; or global institutional money managers, managing investments of institutions and high net worth individuals. Our primary product is a real-time
portfolio management and trading system used by nine of the top ten largest brokerage firms, based on assets under management, and eight of the top ten largest asset managers offering managed accounts. The number of accounts using our market leading
platform topped three million for the first time in 2009. In 2010, we acquired AdviceAmerica, Inc., a developer of software for financial advisors, wealth managers and bank trust departments. This extends our capabilities into front-office
applications such as financial planning, customer relationship management and proposal tools that support the growing needs of financial advisors.

Risk Management

Our risk management business provides
a suite of products and services, including financial crime, compliance, anti-money laundering, fraud prevention, market surveillance and employee fraud detection solutions. Our offerings in this market include Fiserv KRM, Fraud Risk Manager

TM

, Fraud Detection System

SM

, Fraudlink

®

, and Fraudguard

®

.

Financial

We
provide products and services to meet the financial technology needs of banks, credit unions, thrifts and leasing and finance companies. Many of the products and services that we provide are sold as an integrated solution to our clients and include
account, item, and lending processing.



Account Processing

We provide integrated account servicing and management capabilities to our bank, thrift and credit union clients, as well as ancillary value-added products and services that complement the account
processing systems. Account processing solutions are the principal systems that enable a bank to operate and include systems that process customer deposit and loan accounts, an institution’s general ledgers, central information files and other
financial information. These solutions also include extensive security, report generation and other features that financial institutions need to process transactions for their depositors and other customers, as well as to comply with applicable
regulations. Account processing solutions are offered through online data transmission connections to our data processing centers, often called “service bureaus,” or as stand-alone, in-house licensed software for installation on
client-owned computer systems.

While many of our clients contract to obtain all or a majority of their data processing
requirements from us, the modular design of many of our service bureau and software solutions allows clients to start with one application and, as needed, add applications and features developed by us or by third parties. We support a broad range of
terminals and other client-owned peripheral devices manufactured by a variety of vendors. This support capability reduces our clients’ initial conversion expenses, enhances existing clients’ ability to change equipment and broadens our
market.

Our account processing solutions are as follows:

•

Bank and Thrift Account Processing Solutions

. The principal service bureau solutions used by banks and thrifts are: Premier

®

, Signature

TM

, Cleartouch

®

, Source One

SM

solutions to our banking clients, including Premier, Signature and Precision. The Signature system is available both domestically and internationally.

•

, Portico

®

, Reliance

®

, Spectrum

®

, and XP2

®

. These solutions are offered in a service bureau environment, as an in-house licensed software system or in both delivery modes.

Item Processing

We offer item processing solutions to financial institutions and other financial intermediaries. We provide item processing and imaging systems via in-house solutions or in a service bureau environment to
account processing clients as well as to those who do not utilize our account processing systems. Our item processing services include source capture solutions via a web-based platform for check image capture at branch, merchant, consumer, and ATM
locations. Through the Fiserv Clearing Network, we provide complete check clearing and image exchange services. We provide image archive services with online retrieval and full disaster backup, and a number of check imaging products that enable
financial institutions to leverage the processes provided for in the Check Clearing Act of the 21st Century. Our ACH software,
PEP+

®

, enables payments to be originated and received through the ACH system, and, together with our
PEP+reACH

TM

product, allows returned checks, checks at the
point-of-sale, and checks sent to a lockbox to be converted to electronic payments. Our account reconciliation software, ARP/SMS

TM

, is an online, real-time positive pay and reconcilement system that enables clients to monitor deposits and identify
duplicate items, which reduces their exposure to check fraud and helps them manage electronic check conversion. Our compliance solutions enable financial institutions, corporations and government agencies to maintain compliance with state and
federal regulations applicable to them. We also provide consulting services, business operations services and software products that facilitate the transformation of our clients’ payments environment. We enhance a client’s ability to
achieve its goals by enabling it to identify, select and implement the most effective and cost-efficient strategies. Finally, we offer traditional item processing services, including image capture, proof of deposit, in-clearings, statements,
exception and return processing and fraud detection.



Lending Solutions

Our lending business offers a variety of products and services to financial institutions and other financial intermediaries, including: loan origination systems, consumer and commercial lease and loan
servicing products, and default mitigation and business process outsourcing services; a mortgage loan servicing platform and loan origination and tracking systems; and portfolio analytical services.

Corporate Transactions

In 2009, we completed the sale of our Loan Fulfillment Services business (“Fiserv LFS”) and the sale of the balance of our
investment support services business (“Fiserv ISS”). In 2008, we completed the sale of a majority of our health businesses (“Fiserv Health”) to UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc. for approximately $480 million, net of income taxes
and transaction costs, as well as the first of the two transactions to dispose of Fiserv ISS by selling Fiserv Trust Company and the accounts of our institutional retirement plan and advisor services operations to TD AMERITRADE Online Holdings, Inc.
for approximately $200 million, net of income taxes and transaction costs. We also completed the sale of a 51% interest in substantially all of the businesses in our Insurance Services segment (“Fiserv Insurance”) to Trident IV, LP.

Servicing the Market

Our mission is to provide integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. The markets for our account and transaction processing services have specific
needs and requirements, with strong emphasis placed by clients on flexibility, quality, comprehensiveness and integration of product lines, service reliability, timely introduction of new products and features, cost effectiveness, and service
excellence. We believe that our financial strength and primary focus on the financial services industry enhances our ability to meet these needs and service our clients. In addition, we believe that our dedication to providing excellent client
service and support no matter the size of the client and our commitment of substantial resources to training and technical support helps us to retain clients. For example, we conduct client training in technology centers, where we maintain fully
equipped demonstration and training facilities that contain equipment used in the delivery of our services. We also provide on-site training services and online education to clients.

Product Development

To meet the changing technology needs of our clients,
we continually develop, maintain and enhance our products and systems. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, product development expenditures represented approximately 9%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of our total revenue. Our network of development and financial
information technology centers apply the expertise of multiple teams to design, develop and maintain specialized processing systems around our multiple technology platforms. The applications of our account processing systems meet the preferences and
diverse requirements of the international, national, regional or local market-specific financial service environments of our clients. In developing our products, we stress interaction with and responsiveness to the needs of our clients, including
customization of software to meet client needs. We have adopted web services and service-oriented architecture principles in our software development practices so that we and our clients can benefit from the efficient development of technology. We
provide dedicated solutions that are designed, developed, maintained and enhanced according to each client’s goals for service quality, business development, asset and liability mix, and local market positioning as well as other user-defined
parameters.

Intellectual Property

We regard our transaction processing services and related products and our software as proprietary, and utilize a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, internal security
practices and employee and third party non-disclosure agreements for protection. We continue, where appropriate, to seek and



secure patents with respect to our technology. The majority of our patents cover various electronic billing and payment innovations, other financial software products or services, or aspects of
our separately managed accounts services. We believe that we possess all proprietary rights necessary to conduct our business.

Competition

Payments

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (“FIS”), Online Resources Corporation, and Jack Henry and Associates (“Jack Henry”) compete with us most directly as full service banking
and bill payment competitors while other companies compete with us in specific business lines, such as bill payment or online banking. Western Union is the primary competitor to our biller-direct bill payment and walk-in payments businesses. A
number of other companies compete with us in the card-based payment transaction processing business, including MasterCard Incorporated, Visa, Inc. and First Data Corporation. In addition, the possibility of billers and financial institutions
continuing to use or deciding to create in-house systems to handle their own electronic billing and payment transactions, and their own Internet banking solutions in the case of financial institutions, remains a competitive threat. Computer hardware
vendors also offer customized software solutions that permit our clients to develop and use in-house solutions over our products and services. Our markets are highly competitive, and some of our competitors have substantial flexibility in competing
with us, including through the use of integrated product offerings and through pricing. We expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand their product lines and services. In addition,
many companies that provide outsourced Internet finance solutions are consolidating, creating larger competitors with greater resources and broader product lines. Our investment services business competes primarily with providers of portfolio
accounting software and outsourced services and with in-house solutions developed by large financial institutions.

Financial

The market for technology products and services within the financial industry is highly competitive. Our principal
competitors include internal data processing departments, data processing affiliates of large companies and large computer hardware manufacturers, independent computer service firms, and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives.
Some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do. Competition for in-house data processing and software departments is intensified by the efforts of computer hardware vendors which encourage
the growth of internal data centers and consulting service providers who assist these departments with the design and implementation of customized software solutions. Our software products compete in several different market segments and
geographies, including with large diversified computer software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products. Competitive factors for account processing services include product quality, service reliability, product line
comprehensiveness and integration, timely introduction of new products and features, and price. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories. In addition, we believe that our position as an independent vendor, rather than as a
cooperative, an affiliate of a larger corporation or a hardware vendor, is a competitive advantage. We compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions, including FIS, Jack Henry, and
Open Solutions, Inc. There has been significant consolidation among providers of information technology products and services to financial institutions, and we believe this consolidation will continue in the future.

Government Regulation

Fiserv and its subsidiaries are generally not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial
institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions. However, as a provider of services to these financial institutions, our data processing and electronic commerce operations are examined on a regular basis by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Bank,
the National Credit Union Association, the Office of Thrift



Supervision, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and various state regulatory authorities. Because we use the Federal Reserve’s ACH network to process many of our transactions, we
are subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s rules with respect to its ACH network. In addition, independent auditors annually review many of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients, their auditors and regulators.

In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The
Dodd-Frank Act introduces substantial reforms to supervision and operation of the financial services industry, including introducing changes that: affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions; provide for a new resolution procedure
for large financial companies; create a new agency responsible for implementing and enforcing compliance with consumer financial laws; introduce more stringent regulatory capital requirements; and implement changes to corporate governance and
executive compensation practices. It also calls for a number of studies to be conducted and requires significant rule-making. We expect that the Dodd-Frank Act will result in numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry. Until
there are further developments in the rule-making process, however, it is too early to determine what impact this complex legislation will have on us or our clients.

In conducting our electronic commerce business, we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the electronic movement of money. In 2001, the USA Patriot Act amended the Bank Secrecy Act to
expand the definition of Money Services Businesses (“MSBs”) so that it may include businesses operated by us. To this end, in 2002, CheckFree submitted a request for an administrative ruling from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(“FinCEN”) with respect to whether FinCEN views CheckFree as an MSB. To date, we have not received a ruling from FinCEN. If this part of our business is determined to be an MSB, then it will have to register with FinCEN as an MSB and be
regulated as such. Also, nearly all states and the District of Columbia have enacted statutes that require entities engaged in money transmission to register with that jurisdiction’s banking department. We have registered with the relevant
banking departments. In addition, our electronic commerce business is subject to the regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the electronic funds transfer rules embodied in Regulation E promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board and, when
conducting certain transactions, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. CheckFreePay Corporation and its subsidiaries (“CheckFreePay”) are registered as an MSB with FinCen for our walk-in bill payment and ZashPay personal payment services. In
addition, CheckFreePay currently maintains 46 licenses to comply with the various statutes that regulate money transmission mentioned above, and we are subject to annual examinations by such jurisdictions.

From time to time, in order to comply with our obligations under federal and state laws, we are required to comply with annual reporting
or licensing requirements and to implement operating policies and procedures to protect, among other matters, the privacy and security of our clients’ information.

Employees

We have approximately 19,000 employees, many of whom are
specialists in our information management centers and related product and service businesses. This service support network includes employees with backgrounds in computer science and the financial industry, often complemented by management and other
employees with direct experience in banks, thrifts, credit unions, savings institutions, and other financial services environments. Our employees provide expertise in: programming, software development, modification and maintenance; computer
operations, network control and technical support; client services and training; business process outsourcing; item and mortgage processing; system conversions; sales and marketing; and account management.

None of our employees in the United States are represented by a union, and there have been no work stoppages, strikes or, to our
knowledge, attempts to organize. The service nature of our business makes our employees an important corporate asset. Although the market for qualified personnel is competitive, we have not experienced significant difficulty with hiring or retaining
our staff of top industry professionals. In assessing potential acquisition candidates, the quality and stability of the prospective company’s staff are emphasized.

free of charge (other than an investor’s own Internet access charges) through our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably
practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

You should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the
other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Our business may be adversely impacted by U.S.
and global market and economic conditions.

For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue
from products and services we provide to the financial services industry. Given this concentration, we are exposed to the current global economic conditions in the financial services industry. A more troubled or prolonged poor economic environment
could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Consolidations and failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential
clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients.

Many financial institutions are experiencing operating losses,
including many of our clients. In some cases, these operating losses have resulted in the failure and/or consolidation of banks and other financial institutions. Failures, mergers and consolidations of financial institutions reduce the number of our
clients and potential clients, which could adversely affect our revenue. Further, if our clients fail or merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their
use of our services. It is also possible that the larger banks or financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could have greater leverage in negotiating terms with us or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the
services which we currently provide or could provide. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively.

The market for our services is competitive. Our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer. Some of our competitors have substantial resources. Since many of our
larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications in-house, we often compete against our potential clients’ in-house capabilities. Our existing large clients may also seek to perform internally portions of the services
that we currently provide to them. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies, including international providers of similar products and services to ours, having a lower
cost structure. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect
our business, results of operations and financial condition.



If we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace, or if our
ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful, we could lose clients.

The markets for our products and
services are characterized by constant technological changes, frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards. Our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative
products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success. We may not be successful in developing, marketing or selling new products and services that meet
these changing demands. In addition, we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of these services, or our new services and their enhancements may not adequately meet the demands
of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. We continually engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services. If we are unsuccessful in completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology, it would likely have a material
adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients or attract new ones.

If we are unable to renew client contracts at favorable
terms, we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

Failure to
achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business. Our contracts with our clients for account processing services generally run for a period of three to five years in our Financial segment and provide for
termination fees upon early termination. Our contracts with financial services organizations for electronic commerce services generally provide for terms of two to five years. At the end of the contract term, clients have the opportunity to
renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to engage one of our competitors to provide products and services. In addition, it is possible that clients could seek to renegotiate terms with us. If we are not successful in achieving
high renewal rates and favorable contract terms, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

The market
for our electronic transaction services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough to sustain profitability.

If the number of electronic transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. We believe future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by the cost, ease-of-use, security, and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses. In order to consistently
increase and maintain our profitability, consumers and businesses must continue to adopt our services. In addition, if we are unable to continue to decrease the cost of processing transactions, our margins could decrease, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our electronic commerce business also relies on contracts with financial services organizations, businesses, billers, Internet portals and other third parties to provide
branding for our electronic commerce services and to market our services to their customers. These contracts are an important source of the growth in demand for our electronic commerce products. If any of these third parties abandons, curtails or
insufficiently increases its marketing efforts, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements.

In the past several years, we have sold several businesses, including Fiserv Health, Fiserv ISS, Fiserv Insurance, and Fiserv LFS. In
connection with these sales, we made representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agreed to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale. In particular, in
connection with the sale of Fiserv ISS, we agreed to retain, or to indemnify the buyers from, certain liabilities associated with our operation of the business prior to its sale, including liabilities that relate to legal actions, including class
action lawsuits, individual lawsuits and arbitration



proceedings, in which plaintiffs, who are owners of self-directed individual retirement accounts for which Fiserv ISS acted as a custodian, allege that we are responsible for the losses caused by
Ponzi schemes in which such plaintiffs were involved. Our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and related regulations may have an adverse impact on our clients
and our business.

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the
“Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, establishes the new federal Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the
“BCFP”) and requires the BCFP and other federal agencies to implement numerous new regulations. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act or the resulting regulations will impact our business or the
businesses of our current and potential clients. To the extent the regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act negatively impact the business, operations or financial condition of our clients, our business and results of operations could be
materially and adversely affected because, among other matters, our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions. We could be required to
invest a significant amount of time and resources to comply with additional regulations or to modify the manner in which we provide products and services to our clients; and such regulations could limit how much we can charge for our services. We
may not be able to update our existing products and services, or develop new ones, to satisfy our clients’ needs. Any of these events, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

We may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others.

Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. We may violate the rights of others without our
knowledge. We may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our clients against third party infringement claims. If the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are infringing its intellectual property rights, or
that our intellectual property rights are invalid, we may be forced to change our products or services, and such changes may be expensive or impractical. We may then be forced to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights. If
we are unable to agree on acceptable terms, we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations. In addition, we may also be liable for significant financial damages for a violation of intellectual
property rights, and we may incur significant expense in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them. Any adverse result related to violation of third party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely
harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit, they may result in costly and time consuming litigation, and may divert our management and key personnel
from operating our business.

Security breaches or computer viruses could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and
damaging our reputation.

We receive, process, store and transmit our clients’ and their customers’ sensitive
information electronically. Unauthorized access to our computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our operations. These
concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the Internet. Computer viruses can be distributed and rapidly spread over the Internet. Computer viruses could infiltrate our systems, disrupting our delivery of services and
making our applications unavailable. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could have a negative impact on our reputation, could expose us to liability, could decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and could
cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.



Operational failures in our outsourcing or transaction processing businesses could harm our business and
reputation.

An operational failure in our outsourcing or transaction processing businesses could harm our business or
cause us to lose clients. Interruptions of service could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses, including those related to the payment of service credits or other liabilities. A prolonged interruption
of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue. In addition, a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our present and potential clients to
choose another service provider.

We may experience software defects, development delays or installation difficulties, which would harm our
business and reputation and expose us to potential liability.

Our services are based on sophisticated software and
computing systems, and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services. Further, the software underlying our services has occasionally contained and may in the future contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced
or when new versions are released. In addition, we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on platforms used by our clients. Defects in our software, errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or
other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations, delay in market acceptance, additional development and remediation costs, diversion of technical and other resources, loss of clients, negative publicity or exposure to
liability claims. Although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements, we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability.

Our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. The impairment of a significant portion of these assets
would negatively affect our results of operations.

Our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that
represent approximately 75% of our total assets at December 31, 2010. These assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions, including significant goodwill and intangible assets associated
with our acquisition of CheckFree. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. If the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired, then it is
written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings. An impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our results of operations.

Increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations.

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $3.4 billion of long-term debt, including current maturities. We and our subsidiaries
may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our current level of indebtedness and any future increase in our level of indebtedness could: decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general
corporate or other purposes; limit our flexibility to make acquisitions; increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and increase
our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions
and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash
requirements, we may be required, among other things: to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets; to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. Such
measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms, particularly
given current and anticipated economic and credit market conditions.



Acquisitions subject us to risks, including increased debt, assumption of unforeseen liabilities and
difficulties in integrating operations.

A major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has
been our ability to identify, acquire and integrate complementary businesses. We anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses, products and services. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in
the future, which could adversely affect our future growth. Or, businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected, which could adversely affect our business and financial
results. We may not be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the potential benefits of bringing them together. In addition, the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and
divert our resources.

These risks may arise for a number of reasons: we may not be able to find suitable businesses to
acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms; we face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers; we may need to borrow more money from lenders or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future
acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us; changes in accounting, tax, securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions; we may incur unforeseen obligations or
liabilities in connection with acquisitions; we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business; we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition; we
could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience; and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of non-cash impairment charges.

Misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position.

Our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology. We actively seek to protect our proprietary rights. Nevertheless, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services
or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. The steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology. Agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy. Effective
patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available. Misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning
such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If we fail to comply
with applicable regulations our businesses could be harmed.

Our financial services data processing subsidiaries are not
currently directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and credit unions. However, as a provider of services to these financial institutions, our data processing operations
are examined on a regular basis by various federal and state regulatory authorities. It is also possible that new regulations will be imposed on us by the Dodd-Frank Act. If we fail to comply with any applicable regulations, we could be exposed to
suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings, our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients. In addition, the future enactment of more restrictive laws or rules
on the federal or state level, or, with respect to our international operations, in foreign jurisdictions on the national, provincial, state or other level, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our failure to comply with a series of complex regulations in our payments businesses could subject us to liability.

CheckFreePay is licensed as a money transmitter in those states where such licensure is required. These licenses require us to demonstrate
and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and also require us to file



periodic reports. In addition, the businesses are subject to regulation in the United States by FinCEN, including anti-money laundering regulations and certain restrictions on transactions to or
from certain individuals or entities. The complexity of these regulations will continue to increase our cost of doing business. In addition, any violations of law may result in civil or criminal penalties against us and our officers or the
prohibition against us providing money transmitter services in particular jurisdictions.

Item 1B. Unresolved
Staff Comments

Not applicable.

Item 2. Properties

We currently operate
full-service data centers, software system development centers and item processing and back office support centers in 122 cities. We own 13 buildings, and the remaining 157 locations where we operate our businesses are subject to leases expiring in
2011 and beyond. In addition, we maintain our own national data communication network consisting of communications processors and leased lines. We believe our facilities and equipment are generally well maintained and are in good operating
condition. We believe that the computer equipment that we own and our various facilities are adequate for our present and foreseeable business needs. We periodically upgrade our mainframe capability. We maintain our own, and contract with multiple
service providers to provide, processing back-up in the event of a disaster. We also maintain copies of data and software used in our business in locations that are separate from our facilities.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries are named as defendants in lawsuits in which claims are asserted against us. In the opinion of management, the liabilities, if any, which may
ultimately result from such lawsuits are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Overview

Company Background

We provide financial services technology
solutions, including electronic commerce systems and services such as transaction processing, electronic bill payment and presentment, business process outsourcing, document distribution services, and software and systems solutions. We serve
approximately 16,000 clients worldwide including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants, and government agencies. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring
account and transaction fees under contracts with terms ranging from three to five years, and we benefit from high contract renewal rates with our existing clients. The majority of the services we provide to our clients are non-discretionary in
nature and are necessary for them to operate their business.

Our operations are primarily in the United States and are
comprised of the Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) segment, the Financial Institution Services (“Financial”) segment, and the Corporate and Other segment. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment
and presentment services and debit and other card-based payment products and services to meet the electronic transaction processing needs of the financial services industry. The businesses in this segment also provide Internet banking, investment
account processing services for separately managed accounts, card and print personalization services, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts and credit unions with account processing
services, item processing services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. The Corporate and Other segment primarily
consists of unallocated corporate overhead expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and intercompany eliminations.

Industry Trends

Market conditions and volatility over the past two years have created a difficult operating environment for financial institutions and
other businesses in the United States and internationally. As a result, financial institutions have exercised caution in their information technology spending. Despite this challenging environment, in 2010, our revenue was $4.1 billion, net income
per share from continuing operations was $3.34, and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $958 million which increased 1%, 10% and 13%, respectively, as compared to 2009. We believe these financial results
demonstrate the resilience of our recurring fee-based revenue model, the largely non-discretionary nature of our products and services, and mild improvement in the general condition of the financial industry. We believe that financial institutions
are increasingly focused on technology solutions that can help them win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue and enhance their operating efficiency. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial
institutions moving from in-house transaction processing solutions to outsourced solutions.

In each of 2010 and 2009,
approximately 1% of all financial institutions in the United States failed or were subject to government action, which has resulted in the loss of a small number of our clients. However, we believe that the number of government actions in 2011 will
decline slightly as compared to 2010. The increase in bank failures and forced consolidations during the past two years has been, to some extent, offset by a general decline in the level of acquisition activity among financial institutions. A
consolidation benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our platform, or elects to move to one of our platforms, and negatively impacts us when a competing platform is selected. Consolidations and acquisitions also impact our
financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts. These fees are primarily generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary from period to period based on the
number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. We generally do not receive contract termination fees when a financial institution is subject to a government action.

In addition, new legislation, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, will result in numerous new
regulations that will impact the financial industry, although it is too early to determine what impact this complex legislation will have on us or our clients.



Enterprise Priorities

We continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions which enable best-in-class results for our clients.
These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and
differentiating through innovation in our products and services.

Based on our financial results and our focus on growth and
innovation in 2010, we believe we achieved our enterprise priorities for the year. With respect to 2011, our three key enterprise priorities are: (i) to deliver an increased level of high quality revenue growth and increase our earnings per
share as compared to 2010; (ii) to further center the Fiserv culture on growth resulting in more clients and deeper client relationships and to secure a higher share of strategic solutions; and (iii) to provide innovative solutions that
increase differentiation and enhance results for our clients.

Business Developments

Despite the challenges facing the financial industry, we continue to invest in the development of new and strategic products in categories
such as payments, including ZashPay, our person-to-person payment service; account processing, including Acumen, our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions; and others that we believe will increase value to our clients
and enhance the capabilities of our existing solutions. We believe our wide range of market-leading solutions along with the investments we are making in new and differentiated products will favorably position us and our clients to capitalize on the
opportunities in the marketplace.

Critical Accounting Policies

General

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the
reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions
that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates.

Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets

We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine
the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary,
to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to
record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate.

We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
value may not be recoverable. Accounting guidance requires us to perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. First, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based
on the present value of estimated future cash flows and we compare the aggregate fair values to our market capitalization as an assessment of the



appropriateness of our fair value measurements. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not
required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any
impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated
future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2010 determined that our goodwill was not impaired.

We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset
may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given
the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Based on our impairment assessments in 2010, we
determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired.

Revenue Recognition

The majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account and transaction-based fees. Deferred revenue consists primarily of advance
billings for services. Revenue is recognized as services are provided. Revenue is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant
judgments or assumptions. Given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information
about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Other

We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing,
other than letters of credit. We use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates, managing our ratio of fixed to floating-rate debt and foreign exchange rate risks. We do not enter into any derivative
financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Results of Operations

Components of Revenue and Expenses

The following summary describes
the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Processing and Services

Processing and services revenue, which in 2010 represented 83% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily generated from account and
transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenue are most reflective of our
business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following:
personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses.



Product

Product revenue, which in 2010 represented 17% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily derived from integrated print and card production (12%) and software licenses (5%). Cost of product includes
costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. Prior to our sale of a 51%
interest in substantially all of the businesses in our Insurance segment (“Fiserv Insurance,” which is now owned and operated by StoneRiver Group, L.P., or “StoneRiver”) on July 14, 2008, product revenue and cost of product
also included prescription related items which were recognized on a gross basis.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales
personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses.

Financial Results

The following table presents certain amounts
included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes.

(1)

Percentage of revenue is calculated as the relevant revenue, expense, income or loss amount divided by total revenue, except for cost of processing and services and
cost of product amounts which are divided by the related component of revenue.



Total Revenue

Total revenue increased
$56 million, or 1%, in 2010 compared to 2009, and decreased $510 million, or 11%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in total revenue during 2010 was primarily due to 2% revenue growth in our Payments segment and included a 0.5% increase in
revenue in our Financial segment, in each case, as compared to 2009. The decrease in total revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance in July 2008, which resulted in a decrease of $513
million, or 11%. As a result of this transaction, the revenue of Fiserv Insurance is no longer included in our consolidated revenue beginning July 15, 2008. In addition, 2009 revenue was impacted by a 1% increase in revenue in our Payments
segment and a 3% decline in revenue in our Financial segment. Incremental revenue from acquired companies was $3 million and $27 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Revenue in our Payments segment increased $48 million, or 2%, in 2010 and increased $29 million, or 1%, in 2009 compared to the prior year periods. Revenue growth in our Payments segment during 2010 and
2009 was primarily driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased $58 million, or 4%, and $37 million, or 2%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively. This growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and
increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our electronic payments businesses, including our electronic banking and electronic funds transfer businesses. Payments segment revenue growth in 2010 was partially offset by lower product
revenue, which decreased $10 million, or 2%, as compared to 2009, due to lower revenue in our output solutions business, primarily in the first quarter of 2010. In 2009, Payments segment revenue growth was partially offset by revenue declines in our
investment services business from a reduction in the number of accounts processed as a result of the volatility in the U.S. equity markets at that time and a decline in product revenue due primarily to lower software license revenue.

Revenue in our Financial segment increased $9 million, or 0.5%, in 2010 and decreased $50 million, or 3%, in 2009 compared to the prior
year periods. Revenue growth in our Financial segment during 2010 was favorably impacted by a $31 million, or 2%, increase in processing and services revenue due primarily to increased revenue in our bank and credit union account processing
businesses and higher contract termination fee revenue, and was negatively impacted by volume declines in our check processing business which we expect will continue in 2011, decreased revenue in our mortgage lending business, and lower software
license revenue. In 2009, Financial segment revenue was negatively impacted by a $35 million decrease in contract termination fee revenue and a decline in check processing revenue.

Total Expenses

Total expenses decreased $5 million, or 0.2%, in
2010 compared to 2009, notwithstanding an increase in revenue in 2010, primarily due to increased operating leverage and effective management of our overall cost structure. The decrease in total expenses in 2009 of $548 million, or 15%, compared to
2008 was primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance in July 2008, which resulted in a decrease in total expenses of $469 million, or 13%.



Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased
to 54.3% in 2010 from 55.4% in 2009 and 56.3% in 2008. The decreases in 2010 and 2009, which had a positive overall impact on our operating margin, were favorably impacted by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses,
operating efficiency initiatives across the company, and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure.

Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 74.2% in 2010 compared to 71.7% in 2009 and 81.7% in 2008. Cost of product was relatively unchanged in 2010 compared to 2009; however, cost of
product as a percentage of product revenue increased in 2010 due primarily to a decline in higher margin project revenue in our output solutions business and lower software license revenue. In 2008, the higher percentage of product revenue was
primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance, which generated historical overall operating margins of less than 10% primarily due to the inclusion of prescription product costs, which totaled $312 million in 2008, in both product
revenue and cost of product.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $11 million, or 1%, and $62 million, or
8%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to lower employee severance expenses. The decrease in 2009 compared to
2008 was primarily due to a decrease of $36 million from our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance and lower integration expenses associated with our acquisition of CheckFree Corporation (“CheckFree”).

Operating Income and Operating Margin

(1)

Represents the percentage point improvement or decline in operating margin.

Total operating income increased $61 million, or 6%, and $38 million, or 4%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. Operating margin increased to 24.4% in 2010 from 23.2% in
2009 and 19.8% in 2008. The operating margin improvements of 120 basis points and 340 basis points in 2010 and 2009, respectively, were due in part to our continuing operational effectiveness activities and the implementation of strategic
initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure. In addition, the increase in operating income and margin in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to lower merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CheckFree and the sale of a 51%
interest in Fiserv Insurance, which generated lower operating margins, partially offset by a decrease in higher-margin contract termination fees.



Operating income in our Payments segment increased $8 million, or 1%, and $38 million, or
7%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 28.3%, 28.6% and 27.2% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and decreased 30 basis points in 2010 and increased 140 basis points in 2009. Payments segment
operating income and margin in 2010 compared to 2009 were impacted by increased expenses associated with the development and support of new and existing products and services which we expect to enhance our long term revenue growth, partially offset
by increased operating leverage and scale efficiencies in our transaction processing electronic payments businesses. The increases in operating income and margin in 2009 compared to 2008 were primarily due to cost savings associated with the
integration of CheckFree and improved operating leverage in our electronic payments businesses, partially offset by a decline in higher-margin software license revenue.

Operating income in our Financial segment increased $22 million, or 4%, and $24 million, or 4%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 30.3%, 29.3% and 27.4%
in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and increased 100 basis points in 2010 and 190 basis points in 2009. These improvements in operating income and operating margin were primarily due to revenue growth in 2010 and scale and cost efficiencies in
our bank and credit union account processing businesses. In addition, operating income and margin were positively impacted by an increase in higher-margin contract termination fee revenue in 2010 and negatively impacted by a decline in contract
termination fee revenue in 2009.

The operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment decreased $31 million and $20 million
in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior years. The operating loss decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to a $21 million decrease in employee severance expenses and lower merger and integration costs associated with our
acquisition of CheckFree. The operating loss decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to lower expenses, primarily related to our acquisition of CheckFree.

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased $22 million, or 10%,
and $40 million, or 15%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior years. These decreases were primarily due to the continued reduction in total outstanding borrowings in 2010 and 2009. In addition, interest expense in 2010 was lower
than 2009 due to the positive impact of interest rate hedge contracts that expired at the end of 2009.

Interest Income

Interest income was $10 million, $8 million and $13 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest income in
2008 was higher than 2010 and 2009 due primarily to interest income earned from investing the proceeds of our business dispositions.

Loss on Early Debt Extinguishment

In September 2010, we issued $750 million of senior notes in a public offering with a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 4.0%. In October 2010, we used a portion of the proceeds from the
senior notes offering to purchase $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 for $276 million including the premium paid and other costs associated with the transaction. As a result of this transaction,
we recorded a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $26 million.

Loss on Sale of Businesses

In 2008, we recognized a $21 million pre-tax loss due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance.



Income Tax Provision

Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 38.0% in 2010, 37.2% in 2009, and 44.9% in 2008. The higher effective income tax rate in 2008 was due primarily to income taxes associated with
our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. In addition, our effective income tax rate in 2009 includes the positive impact of a tax settlement. The significant items impacting our effective income tax rates for continuing operations were
as follows:

(1)

Represents a $34 million income tax provision related to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance.

(2)

Represents a $7 million income tax benefit recognized in conjunction with the final settlement of a CheckFree purchase accounting income tax reserve.

Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate

We record our 49% share of StoneRiver’s net income, $14 million, $12 million and $6 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as
income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations

Income (loss) from discontinued operations totaled $(10) million, $3 million and $211 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In
2009 and 2008, we recognized after-tax gains from the sale of businesses of $25 million and $229 million, respectively.

Net Income Per
Share—Diluted from Continuing Operations

Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $3.34 in
2010 compared to $3.04 in 2009 and $2.20 in 2008. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2010 compared to 2009 was positively impacted by operating income growth in 2010, partially offset by an $0.11 per share loss on early debt
extinguishment. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2009 compared to 2008 was positively impacted by operating income growth in 2009, a $0.34 per share after-tax loss on the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance
recognized in 2008, and a $0.14 per share decrease in merger related expenses in 2009 associated with our acquisition of CheckFree. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing
operations by $0.60, $0.58 and $0.57 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the principal and interest requirements of
our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using our cash flow generated by operations, our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010 of
$563 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $971 million at December 31, 2010.

Our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, or operating cash flow, increased
$108 million, or 13%, to $958 million in 2010 from $850 million in 2009. Our operating cash flow in 2010 included a $40 million dividend from StoneRiver, of which we own 49%, that we do not expect to recur on an annual basis. Our current policy is
to use our operating cash flow to repay debt and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures of $175 million and $198 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, were less than
5% of our total revenue in each year.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, we received $89 million from StoneRiver, of which we own
49%, comprised of a $61 million dividend and a $28 million repayment of a loan. The portion of this dividend that represented a return on our investment, $40 million, is reported in cash flows from operating activities.

Share Repurchases

We purchased $413 million, $175 million and $441 million of our common stock in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. On November 16, 2010, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to
7.0 million additional shares of our common stock and, as of December 31, 2010, we had 6.0 million shares remaining under this authorization. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans.

Indebtedness

In September 2010, we issued $750 million of senior notes due in 2015 and 2020. We used the proceeds from
this offering to repay a portion of our senior term loan borrowings and, as described below, to repurchase a



portion of our senior notes due in 2012. In 2010, our debt repayments, net of the $750 million senior notes offering, totaled $285 million. In addition, we paid $26 million of premium and other
costs associated with the repurchase of the senior notes. At December 31, 2010, our long-term debt consisted primarily of $1.1 billion senior term loan borrowings and $2.25 billion of senior notes. We were in compliance with all financial debt
covenants in 2010.

Senior Term Loan

In December 2007, we entered into an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks. Term loan borrowings under this facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a
specified margin or the bank’s base rate and mature in November 2012. The weighted-average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 0.9% at December 31, 2010. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants
substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below.

Senior Notes

In September 2010, we issued $300 million of 3.125% senior notes due in October 2015 and $450 million of 4.625% senior
notes due in October 2020, which pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 commencing on April 1, 2011. Our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 and 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017 pay interest at the stated rate
on May 20 and November 20 of each year. The interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indenture governing the
senior notes contains covenants that, among other matters, limit: our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person; our and certain of our
subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens; and our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions.

Tender Offer to Purchase Senior Notes

In October
2010, we purchased $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 for $276 million including the premium paid and other costs associated with the transaction.

Revolving Credit Facility

In September 2010, we entered into a new $1.0 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks and terminated our then existing $900 million revolving credit facility, which was set to expire
in March 2011. Borrowings under the new revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate. There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance
requirements. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, (i) to limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments and (ii) to maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated
interest expense. The facility expires in September 2014. As of December 31, 2010, we issued letters of credit totaling $29 million under the new facility, and had available borrowings of $971 million.

Interest Rate Hedge Contracts

We maintain interest rate swap agreements (“Swaps”) with total notional values of $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to manage exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates. Additionally, in 2010, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements (“Forward-Starting Swaps”) with total notional values of $200 million to hedge against changes in interest rates
applicable to forecasted fixed rate borrowings. The Swaps effectively fix the interest rates on floating rate term loan



borrowings at a weighted-average rate of approximately 5.0%, prior to financing spreads and related fees, and have expiration dates through September 2012. The Forward-Starting Swaps, which
expire in September 2012, effectively fix the benchmark interest rate on forecasted five-year and ten-year borrowings at weighted-average rates of approximately 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively.

Shelf Registration Statement

In 2010, we filed a
“shelf” registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the registration statement, we may sell common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, or a combination thereof. Each time we sell securities pursuant to
the shelf registration statement, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus
from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to
repay debt or for working capital, acquisitions or general corporate purposes.

Other

Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions.
Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our
common stock. As of December 31, 2010, we had a credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BBB- with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services (“S&P”) on our senior unsecured debt securities.

The interest rate payable on our senior notes is
subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody’s or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest
rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 2.0%. In no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes nor will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed 2.0%
above the original interest rate. The interest rates on any series of notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment if the notes becomes rated A3 (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody’s and A- (or its equivalent) or higher by
S&P, in each case with a stable or positive outlook.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements other than letters of credit. The following table details our
contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2010:

(1)

Interest and operating lease payments are reported on a pre-tax basis.



Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, currency exchange
rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. We are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding
debt, investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency risk. We actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management.

In connection with processing electronic payments transactions, the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable merchants.
These subscriber funds are invested in short-term instruments that are guaranteed by the United States government. Subscriber funds, which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill
payment activity, and totaled approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2010. Based on interest rates and subscriber funds balances at December 31, 2010, a 1% increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual income from
continuing operations by approximately $10 million, and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero, our annual income from continuing operations would decrease by less than $5 million.

We manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating-rate debt and through the use of interest rate
hedge contracts. We currently use interest rate swaps with total notional values of $1 billion and forward-starting swaps with total notional values of $200 million at December 31, 2010, to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes
and to control financing costs. Generally, under these swaps, we agree with a counter-party to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount. Based on our outstanding debt with
variable interest rates at December 31, 2010, a 1% increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2011 by approximately $1 million.

We conduct business in the U.S. and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign
investments and foreign currency transactions. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these rates were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2010,
there would not have been a material adverse impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of the Business

Fiserv, Inc. and its subsidiaries
(collectively, the “Company”) provide financial services technology solutions, including electronic commerce systems and services such as transaction processing, electronic bill payment and presentment, business process outsourcing,
document distribution services, and software and systems solutions. The Company’s operations are primarily in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products (“Payments”) segment, the Financial Institution
Services (“Financial”) segment, and the Corporate and Other segment. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services and debit and other card-based payment products and services to meet the
electronic transaction processing needs of the financial services industry. The businesses in this segment also provide Internet banking, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, card and print personalization
services, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts and credit unions with account processing services, item processing services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and
consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. The Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate overhead expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible
assets and intercompany eliminations. As discussed in Note 3, in 2008 the Company completed the sale of a 51% interest in substantially all of the businesses in the Insurance Services segment.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fiserv, Inc. and all 100% owned subsidiaries. Investments in less than 50% owned affiliates in which the Company has significant influence are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use
of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Acquisitions

The Company completed one acquisition in 2010 and three acquisitions in 2008. These acquisitions were not significant and
the results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income from the dates of acquisition.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company applies fair value accounting for all
assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in its financial statements on a recurring basis. Fair value represents the amount that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous
market and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued

Years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008

The fair values of cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, settlement assets and
obligations, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the carrying values due to the short period of time to maturity. The fair value of interest rate hedge contracts is described in Note 4 and was based on valuation models using inputs
which are available through third party dealers and are related to market price risk, such as the LIBOR interest rate curve, credit risk and time value. The fair value of long-term debt is also described in Note 4 and was estimated using discounted
cash flows based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates or quoted prices in active markets.

Derivative Instruments

Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. If the
derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in the consolidated statements of income when
the hedged item affects earnings. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings. To the extent the fair value hedge is effective, there is an offsetting adjustment
to the basis of the item being hedged. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of hedges are recognized in earnings. The Company’s policy is to enter into derivative financial instruments with creditworthy institutions and not to
enter into such instruments for speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency

Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, where the functional currency is the local currency, are translated into U.S. dollars
at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Gains and losses from foreign currency translation are recorded as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Revenue Recognition

Processing and services revenue are primarily derived from account and transaction-based fees for data processing, transaction processing, electronic billing and payment services, electronic funds
transfer and debit processing services, consulting services and software maintenance fees, and are recognized as services are provided. Software maintenance fee revenue for ongoing client support is recognized ratably over the term of the applicable
support period, which is generally 12 months. Deferred revenue consists primarily of advance billings for services and is recognized as revenue when the services are provided.

Product revenue is primarily derived from integrated print and card production sales and software licenses. The Company recognizes product revenue, such as software license sales, which represent less
than 5% of total revenue, when written contracts are signed, delivery of the product has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Prior to the Company’s sale of a 51% interest in substantially all of the
businesses in its Insurance Services segment on July 14, 2008, product revenue also included prescription product revenue which was recognized on a gross basis to include the prescription price.

The Company includes reimbursements from clients, such as postage and telecommunication costs, in processing and services revenue,
product revenue, cost of processing and services, and cost of product.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel,
administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; amortization of certain intangible assets; and other selling and administrative expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and
investments with original maturities of 90 days or less.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts, client creditworthiness, current economic trends,
changes in client payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in an additional allowance for
doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $9 million and $11 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Settlement Assets and Obligations

Settlement assets of $114 million and $137 million were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and settlement obligations of $119 million
and $143 million were included in accrued expenses at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Settlement assets and obligations primarily represent amounts receivable from or payable to clients, agents and payment networks associated with the
Company’s walk-in and expedited bill payment service businesses. The majority of these assets and obligations result from timing differences, which are typically less than seven days, between collecting funds from payment networks or directly
from consumers who are making payments and depositing the funds collected into the Company’s bank accounts. Settlement assets and obligations also arise due to the reporting of transactions to clients prior to fulfilling the payment obligation.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are reported at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the
leasehold period, if applicable. Property and equipment consisted of the following at December 31:

Depreciation expense for all property and equipment totaled $84 million, $91 million and $103 million in
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Customer related intangible assets represent customer contracts and relationships obtained as part of
acquired businesses and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally 10 to 20 years. Acquired software and technology represents software and technology intangible assets obtained as part of acquired businesses and is amortized over
their estimated useful lives, generally four to eight years. Trade names are amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives, generally 10 to 20 years. Amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, which include customer related
intangible assets, acquired software and technology, and trade names, totaled $148 million, $145 million and $150 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company estimates that annual amortization expense with respect to acquired
intangible assets will be approximately $150 million in 2011, $140 million in each of 2012 and 2013, and $130 million in each of 2014 and 2015.

Capitalized software development costs represent the capitalization of certain costs incurred to develop new software or to enhance existing software which is marketed externally or utilized by the
Company to process client transactions. Costs are capitalized commencing when the technological feasibility of the software has been established. Routine maintenance of software products, design costs and development costs incurred prior to
establishment of a product’s technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives which is generally five years. Gross software development costs capitalized
for new products and enhancements to existing products totaled $86 million, $81 million and $74 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Amortization of previously capitalized development costs was $58 million, $45 million and $43 million in
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Purchased software represents software licenses purchased from third parties and is
amortized over the estimated useful lives, generally three to five years. Amortization of purchased software totaled $42 million, $43 million and $43 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The Company reviews, on an annual basis, or
more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment, the carrying value of goodwill by comparing reporting unit carrying values to estimated fair values. No impairment was identified in the Company’s annual impairment assessment in
the fourth quarter of 2010. The changes in goodwill during 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

Asset Impairment

The Company reviews property and equipment, intangible assets and its investment in unconsolidated affiliate for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of property and equipment and intangible assets is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. The
Company’s investment in unconsolidated affiliate is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to its estimated fair value and is impaired if the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. Measurement of
any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs related to the Company’s senior term loan and senior notes borrowings totaled $36 million and $25 million at
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Accumulated amortization was $18 million and $12 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Deferred financing costs are reported in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance
sheets and are amortized over the term of the underlying debt using the interest method.

Accounts payable and accrued expenses consisted of the following at December 31:



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued

Years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008

Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax basis and net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance, if necessary, is recorded against deferred tax assets for which utilization of the asset is not likely.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

Accumulated other comprehensive loss,
net of income taxes, consisted of the following at December 31:

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average
number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during the applicable period. Common stock equivalents consist of stock options and restricted stock awards and are computed using the treasury stock method. In 2010, 2009 and 2008,
the Company excluded 2.8 million, 2.9 million and 2.4 million weighted-average shares, respectively, from the calculations of common stock equivalents for anti-dilutive stock options.

The computation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per share is as follows:

3. Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate

On July 14, 2008, the Company completed the sale of a 51% interest in substantially all of the businesses in its Insurance Services segment (“Fiserv Insurance”) to Trident IV, LP. The
Company recognized an after-tax loss of $0.34 per share on the sale. This loss on sale was comprised of a pre-tax loss of $21 million and income tax expense of $34 million which was incurred on sale due to a significantly lower tax basis in the
stock compared to the book basis of the net assets sold (see Note 5). The Company received net cash proceeds of $497 million, net of cash sold and transaction expenses, and a $30 million note. The Company’s share of the net income of Fiserv
Insurance (n/k/a StoneRiver Group, L.P. or “StoneRiver”) is reported as income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate, and the revenue and expenses of StoneRiver after July 14, 2008 are not included in the Company’s
consolidated statements of income. The Company’s consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to July 14, 2008 include the revenue, expenses and cash flows of Fiserv Insurance.

specified margin or the bank’s base rate and mature in November 2012. The weighted-average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 0.9% at December 31, 2010. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants
substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below.



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued

Years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008

Senior Notes

In September 2010, the Company issued $300 million of 3.125% senior notes due in October 2015 and $450 million of 4.625% senior notes due in October 2020, which pay interest semi-annually on April 1
and October 1 commencing on April 1, 2011. The Company’s 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 and 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017 pay interest at the stated rate on May 20 and November 20 of each year. The
interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that the Company’s credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that,
among other matters, limit: the Company’s ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its properties and assets to, another person; the Company’s and certain of its subsidiaries’
ability to create or assume liens; and the Company’s and certain of its subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions.

Tender Offer to Purchase Senior Notes

In October 2010, the Company
purchased $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 for $276 million including the premium paid and other costs associated with the transaction. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a
pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $26 million.

Revolving Credit Facility

In September 2010, the Company entered into a new $1.0 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks and terminated its then
existing $900 million revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in March 2011. Borrowings under the new revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank’s base rate. There
are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require the Company, among other things, to (i) limit its consolidated indebtedness to
no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments, and (ii) maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2010. The facility expires in September 2014. As of
December 31, 2010, the Company issued letters of credit totaling $29 million under its new facility, and had available borrowings of $971 million.

Interest Rate Hedge Contracts

The Company maintains interest rate swap
agreements (“Swaps”) with total notional values of $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Additionally, in 2010, the Company entered into
forward-starting interest rate swap agreements (“Forward-Starting Swaps”) with total notional values of $200 million to hedge against changes in interest rates applicable to forecasted fixed rate borrowings. The Swaps and Forward-Starting
Swaps have been designated by the Company as cash flow hedges. The Swaps effectively fix the interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings at a weighted-average rate of approximately 5.0%, prior to financing spreads and related fees, and have
expiration dates through September 2012. The Forward-Starting Swaps, which expire in September 2012, effectively fix the benchmark interest rate on forecasted five-year and ten-year borrowings at weighted-average rates of approximately 2.7% and
3.3%, respectively. The fair values of the Swaps, which totaled $76 million and $92 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were recorded in other long-term liabilities and in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income
taxes, in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued

Years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008

the Forward-Starting Swaps, which totaled $11 million at December 31, 2010, were recorded in other long-term assets and in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes, in the
consolidated balance sheet. The components of other comprehensive income pertaining to interest rate hedge contracts are reported within the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, interest expense recognized
due to hedge ineffectiveness was not significant, and no amounts were excluded from the assessments of hedge effectiveness. Based on the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2010, the Company estimates that
it will recognize approximately $40 million in interest expense during 2011 related to interest rate hedge contracts.

expected to total approximately $15 million.

The Company classifies interest and penalties related to income taxes as
components of its income tax provision. The income tax provision from continuing operations included interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits of less than $1 million in 2010 and $2 million in each of 2009 and 2008. Accrued interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled $7 million and $9 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

6. Employee Stock and Savings Plans

Stock Plans

The Company recognizes the fair value of share-based
compensation expense for stock options, restricted stock awards, shares received by employees under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan and similar awards in cost of processing and services, cost of product, and selling, general and
administrative expense in its consolidated statements of income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the underlying awards.

The Company’s share-based compensation primarily consists of the following:

Stock Options

– The Company generally grants stock options to employees and non-employee directors at exercise prices
equal to the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the dates of grant, which are typically in the first quarter of the year. Stock options generally vest over a three year period beginning on the first anniversary of the grant. All stock
options expire ten years from the date of the award. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the stock options over the requisite service period of the stock option award.

Restricted Stock Units

– The Company awards restricted stock units to employees and non-employee directors. The Company
recognizes compensation expense for restricted stock units based on the market price on the date of award over the period during which the awards vest.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

– The Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan that allows eligible employees to purchase a limited number of shares of common stock each quarter
through payroll deductions at 85% of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the last business day of each calendar quarter. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to the 15% discount on the purchase date.

Share-based compensation expense was $39 million, $36 million and $34 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The income tax
benefits related to share-based compensation totaled $13 million, $12 million and $12 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost for unvested stock options and
restricted stock awards, net of estimated forfeitures, of $46 million is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.

The weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $17.46, $12.76 and $20.56 per share, respectively. The fair values of stock options granted were estimated
on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model with the following assumptions:



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued

Years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008

The Company determined the expected life of stock options using historical data adjusted
for known factors that would alter historical exercise behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect as of the grant date. Expected volatility is determined using weighted-average implied market volatility
combined with historical volatility. The Company believes that a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility better reflects future market conditions and better indicates expected volatility than purely historical volatility.

A summary of stock option activity is as follows:

A summary of restricted stock award activity is as follows:

The table below presents additional information related to stock option and restricted stock award activity:

As of
December 31, 2010, 5.0 million share-based awards were available for grant under the Fiserv, Inc. 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Under its employee stock purchase plan, the Company issued 0.5 million, 0.6 million and
0.7 million shares in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of January 1, 2011, there were 1.7 million shares available for issuance under the employee stock purchase plan.

their salaries, subject to certain limitations. The Company makes matching contributions, subject to certain limitations, and makes discretionary contributions based upon the attainment of specified financial results. Company contributions charged
to continuing operations under these plans were $29 million, $37 million and $33 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

7. Leases, Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

In the normal course of business, the Company and its
subsidiaries are named as defendants in various lawsuits in which claims are asserted against the Company. In the opinion of management, the liabilities, if any, which may ultimately result from such lawsuits are not expected to have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

Electronic Payments Transactions

In connection with the Company’s processing of electronic payments transactions, funds received from subscribers are invested from
the time the Company collects the funds until payments are made to the applicable merchants. These subscriber funds are invested in short-term instruments that are guaranteed by the United States government. Subscriber funds, which are not included
in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment activity, and totaled approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Fiserv, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fiserv, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of
income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule of the Company listed in the Index at Item 15.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Fiserv, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

(a)

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
December 31, 2010.

Management Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

. Based on management’s assessment, our management believes
that, as of December 31, 2010, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Our
independent registered public accounting firm has issued their attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. The report is included below under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm On
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.”

(c)

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(d)

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting and has issued their report as set forth below.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Fiserv, Inc.:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Fiserv, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and
consolidated financial statement schedule.
