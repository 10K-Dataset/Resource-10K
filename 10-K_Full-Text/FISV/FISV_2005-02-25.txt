PART I

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements

Certain matters discussed in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K are “forward-looking statements” intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can generally be identified
as such because the context of the statement will include words such as “believes,” “anticipates” or “expects,” or words of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe future plans, objectives or goals of
Fiserv, Inc. (“Fiserv” or the “Company”) are also forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those
currently anticipated. Factors that could affect results include, among others, economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting the Company’s operations, markets, services and related products, prices and
other factors discussed in the Company’s prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the Company’s ability to complete the proposed sale of its securities clearing businesses. Shareholders, potential investors and
other readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Fiserv assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Item 1. Business

Fiserv provides
integrated data processing and information management systems to more than 16,000 financial services providers, including banks, credit unions, financial planners and investment advisers, insurance companies and agents, self-insured employers,
leasing companies, lenders and savings institutions. The Company operates centers in the United States for full-service financial data processing, software system development, item processing and check imaging, technology support and related product
businesses. The Company’s operations are principally domestic and in 2004 international operations constituted approximately 3% of total processing and services revenues through business support centers in Argentina, Australia, Canada,
Colombia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Poland, Singapore and the United Kingdom.

The Company was formed in 1984 through the combination of two major regional data processing firms that began as the data processing operations of their parent financial institutions. Historically, these firms
expanded operations by developing a range of services for their parent organizations, as well as other financial institutions. Since its organization, Fiserv has grown by developing highly specialized services and product enhancements, adding new
clients and acquiring firms complementing the Fiserv organization.

Business Strategy

The market for
products and services offered by financial institutions continues to undergo change. The financial industry introduces and implements new alternative lending and investment products with great frequency. The distinctions among financial services
traditionally offered by banking and thrift organizations as well as by securities and insurance firms continue to narrow, as traditionally different entities compete for the same ultimate customers with competitive services. Financial institutions
diversify and consolidate on an ongoing basis in response to market pressures, as well as under the auspices of regulatory agencies.

Although such market changes have led to consolidations that have reduced the number of financial institutions in the United States, consolidation has not
resulted in a material reduction of the number of customers or financial accounts serviced by the financial industry as a whole.



To stay competitive in this changing marketplace, financial institutions are providing their customers
with a broad variety of new products and services that are typically transaction-oriented and fee-based. The growing volume and types of transactions and accounts have increased the data processing requirements of these institutions. As a
consequence, Fiserv believes that the financial services industry is one of the largest users of data processing products and services.

Moreover, Fiserv expects that the financial industry will continue to require significant commitments of capital and human resources to the information
systems requirements, to require application of more specialized systems and to require development, maintenance and enhancement of applications software. Fiserv believes that economies of scale in data processing operations are essential to justify
the required level of expenditures and commitment of human resources.

Fiserv provides financial institutions with software to run operations internally or to outsource services. Many financial institutions that previously developed their own software systems and maintained their own data processing operations
have outsourced their data processing requirements by licensing their software from a third party or by contracting with third-party processors to reduce costs and enhance their products and services. Outsourcing can involve the licensing of
software, which eliminates the costly technical expertise within a financial institution, or the utilization of service bureaus, facilities management or resource management capabilities. Fiserv provides all of these options to the financial
industry.

In 2001, Fiserv expanded its scope of transaction
processing from the financial industry to the processing of health claims primarily for employers that self-insure their health plans. These services include claim adjudication and payment, customer service, reporting and other related services.

In the health care market, as costs continue to rise, health
plan sponsors continue to seek to reduce costs. Managed care companies and traditional third-party administrators, as well as many new niche specialty service providers, have turned their focus to broad cost-containment and related consulting needs
or have sought to meet specific problems related to prescription management, health care administration or payment process requirements. These organizations seek to assist the health plan sponsors to reduce their absolute costs, to manage existing
cost bases, to make themselves more efficient by the services they currently provide or to add services to existing offerings that seek over a longer term to reduce ultimate costs or improve efficiencies.

Fiserv has implemented a strategy of continuing to develop new products,
improving the cost effectiveness of services provided to clients, aggressively soliciting new clients, and making both opportunistic and strategic acquisitions. In 2002, Fiserv acquired five businesses, with combined annual revenues of more than
$210 million and approximately 1,100 employees. In 2003, Fiserv acquired 12 businesses, with combined annual revenues of more than $610 million and approximately 3,200 employees. In 2004, Fiserv acquired four businesses, with combined annual
revenues of more than $40 million and approximately 260 employees. The following is a summary of acquisitions made by Fiserv since its organization. Indicated by an asterisk are previously acquired businesses that are included in discontinued
operations as a result of entry by Fiserv Clearing, Inc. into a definitive sales agreement involving the proposed disposition of Fiserv’s securities clearing businesses. See “Discontinued Operations – Securities Clearing
Services” herein.

Principal Products and Services

The Company provides an extensive portfolio of products and services to enable banking, lending, insurance, health and
investment providers to deliver anywhere, anytime financial services to their customer base.

The Company’s operations have been classified into three primary business segments. The financial institution outsourcing, systems and services business segment provides account and transaction processing systems
and services to financial institutions and other financial intermediaries; the health plan management services segment provides services primarily to employers who self-insure their health plan, including services such as handling payments to
healthcare providers, assisting with cost controls, plan design services, medical provider administration, prescription benefit management and other related services; and the investment support services business segment that provides retirement plan
administration services to individual retirement plan & pension administrators, financial planners and financial institutions.

Financial information concerning the Company’s industry segments is included in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the
Company’s Annual Report to Shareholders included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 13 and such information is incorporated herein by reference.

Financial Institution Outsourcing, Systems and Services.

Fiserv provides financial services and products that are focused on technology needs to
more than 9,400 financial institutions, including banks, credit unions, leasing and finance companies, mortgage lenders and savings institutions and 2,900 insurance companies.

“Core” Products.

Fiserv delivers “core” products that integrate account servicing and management
information functions for its financial institution clients, as well as ancillary value-added products and services that complement the “core” products. “Core” products include systems to process various customer deposit and loan
accounts, a financial institution’s general ledgers, central information files and other financial information and include the extensive security, report generation and other features required by a financial institution to process transactions
for its depositors and other customers, as well as to meet its regulatory compliance requirements and its own management information needs. “Core” products are offered through on-line data transmission connections to Fiserv data processing
centers, often called “service bureaus”, or as stand-alone, in-house, licensed software for installation on client-owned computer systems.

While many clients contract to obtain all or a majority of their data processing requirements from Fiserv, the modular design of many of the
Company’s service bureau and software products allows a client to start with one application, such as a deposit system, and gradually add applications and features as needed. Fiserv supports a broad range of terminals and other client-owned
peripheral devices manufactured by many different vendors. This support capability reduces the client’s initial conversion expenses, enhances an existing client’s ability to change equipment and broadens the Company’s market.

Bank and Thrift “Core” Products.

Company’s principal service bureau products used by banks, thrifts and savings institutions include Fiserv VISION

distributors and third-party administrators rely on Fiserv for policy, rating, claims, billing and reinsurance administration, compliance, education and marketing support.

insurance industry. These products and services include administration systems, such as Claims Workstation, Policy STAR and Specialty System for property and casualty and the Fiserv Life Insurance Solutions ID3 and Life Portraits systems for life,
annuity and health requirements. Additionally, complete business process outsourced services are offered for flood insurance and information technology outsourcing services are available for all product sets. Regulatory and compliance products

life insurance marketplace.

Complementary or Add-On
Products.

In addition to the “core” products, Fiserv offers complementary products and back-office products and services. These products and services allow financial institutions to offer additional services to their clients such as
home banking, automated teller machine access and other treasury and related services of varying complexity and sophistication, such as asset-liability modeling and cash management. Specifically, Fiserv offers products to its financial institution
clients that allow them in turn to offer sophisticated banking services to their individual customers such as electronic funds transfer services offered by Fiserv EFT/CNS that include the ACCEL network and related ATM access services, as well as
Internet banking products offered through Fiserv eSolutions that allow individual bank customers to bank from home.

Fiserv also offers its financial institution clients complementary or add-on products that amplify the “core” products such as item processing
and imaging systems for the item processing needs of clients, treasury and investment management systems including a series of treasury management products sold under the BANKLINK

®

name and the CBS Worldwide MetaBank Portfolio Management and Investment Portfolio Accounting systems, as well as a
suite of EPSIIA and Imagesoft electronic document management systems.

Discontinued Operations – Securities Clearing
Services.

On December 16, 2004, Fiserv entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) among Fiserv Inc., Fiserv Clearing, Inc. and National Financial Services LLC (“National Financial”) to sell its securities clearing
businesses pursuant to which National Financial will acquire all of the outstanding shares of BHC Investments, Inc., a subsidiary of Fiserv (“BHC”), for approximately $349 million in cash payable at closing, subject to certain post-closing
adjustments, plus a contingent payment of up to $15 million to be paid after the first anniversary of the closing date based on achievement of specific revenue targets. Consummation of the transaction is subject to customary conditions to closing,
including receipt of regulatory approvals. The Agreement provides that Fiserv will be required to retain certain liabilities of BHC, including, among others, those relating to the previously announced Securities and Exchange Commission investigation
of Fiserv Securities, Inc., a subsidiary of BHC. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2005. The financial results of Fiserv’s securities clearing businesses are reported as
discontinued operations in Fiserv’s consolidated financial statements.

Servicing the Market

The markets for
Fiserv’s account and transaction processing services and products have specific needs and requirements, with strong emphasis placed by clients on software flexibility, product quality, service reliability, comprehensiveness and integration of
product lines, timely introduction of new products and features, cost effectiveness and service excellence. Through its multiple product offerings, the Company believes it successfully services these market needs and requirements for clients ranging
in size from start-ups to some of the largest financial services providers.



Fiserv offers clients a selection of information management and data processing products and services
designed to meet the specific needs of the ever-changing financial services and health plan services industries. The Company believes its financial strength and primary focus on the financial services and health plan services industries helps its
business development, client service and product support teams remain responsive to the technology needs of its markets.

“The Client Comes First” is one of the Company’s founding principles. It is a belief backed by a dedication to providing ongoing client
service and support—no matter what size of client.

The
Company believes its commitment of substantial resources to training and technical support helps it retain clients. Fiserv conducts the majority of its new and ongoing client training in its technology centers, where the Company maintains fully
equipped demonstration and training facilities containing equipment used in the delivery of Fiserv services. Fiserv also provides local and on-site training services to its clients.

Product Development

To meet the changing technology needs of the clients Fiserv serves, the Company continually develops, maintains and enhances its systems. In 2004, product
development expenses represented approximately 6% of the Company’s processing and services revenues.

The Fiserv network of development and financial information technology centers applies the expertise of multiple Fiserv teams to design, develop and
maintain specialized processing systems around its multiple technology platforms. The applications of its account processing systems meet the preferences and diverse requirements of the various international, national, regional or local market
specific financial service environments of the Company’s many clients. If the client’s requirements warrant, Fiserv purchases software programs from third parties that are interfaced with existing Fiserv systems. In developing its
products, Fiserv stresses interaction with and responsiveness to the needs of its clients.

Fiserv provides a dedicated solution that is designed, developed, maintained and enhanced according to each client’s goals for service quality, business development, asset and liability mix, local market
positioning and other user-defined parameters.

Intellectual Property

Fiserv regards its software as proprietary and utilizes a
combination of trade secrecy laws, internal security practices and employee non-disclosure agreements for protection. The Company believes that legal protection of its software, while important, is less significant than the knowledge and experience
of the Company’s management and personnel and their ability to develop, enhance and market new products and services. The Company believes that it holds all proprietary rights necessary for the conduct of its business.

Competition

Financial Institution Outsourcing, Systems and Services.

The market for information technology products and services
within the financial industry is highly competitive. The Company’s principal competitors include internal data processing departments, data processing affiliates of large companies or large computer hardware manufacturers, independent computer
service firms and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives. Some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales and marketing resources than the Company. Competition for in-house data processing and software
departments is intensified by the efforts of computer hardware vendors who encourage the growth of internal data centers.



Competitive factors for processing services include product quality, service reliability, product line
comprehensiveness and integration, timely introduction of new products and features, and price. The Company believes that it competes favorably in each of these categories. In addition, the Company believes that its position as an independent
vendor, rather than as a cooperative, an affiliate of a larger corporation or a hardware vendor, is a competitive advantage.

We compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions and other financial intermediaries,
including The Bisys Group, Inc., Fidelity Information Services, Inc., Jack Henry and Associates, Inc., Metavante Corporation and Open Solutions, Inc. There has been significant consolidation among providers of information technology products and
services to financial institutions, and we believe this consolidation will continue in the future.

Health Plan Management Services

.

The market for the Company’s administrative services is highly competitive. The major competition for
the Company’s services comes from national and regional health insurance and managed care companies selling administrative services only. Many of the Company’s competitors serve a larger number of customers, have greater financial
resources and proprietary products. In addition, the self-insured health plan market is typically broker-controlled, highly price sensitive and frequently placed out for competitive bid. Significant competitors of the Company include Blue Cross
organizations, UnitedHealth Group, Cigna and Aetna.

Investment Support Services.

Several trust companies, the most notable of which is Delaware Charter, compete with the Company in custody services for self-directed retirement accounts. In the provision of services to financial
advisors and the mutual fund trading area, Charles Schwab & Co., which handles a much larger volume of such trades, is the Company’s most significant competitor.

Government Regulation

The Company’s data processing subsidiaries are not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically applicable to financial institutions
such as banks, thrifts and credit unions. However, as a provider of services to these financial institutions, the Company’s data processing operations are examined on a regular basis by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National
Credit Union Association, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and various state regulatory authorities. In addition, independent auditors annually review several of the Company’s operations to provide
internal control evaluations for its clients’ auditors and regulators.

The Company’s subsidiaries operating as part of the Company’s health plan management services segment are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at both the federal and state levels. This regulatory
oversight extends from annual reporting and licensing requirements imposed by most of the states in which these companies operate and continues on to extensive regulatory compliance requirements regarding day-to-day operating policies and procedures
for the various operating units. In particular, there has been increasing levels of regulation regarding privacy and security related to patients’ health care information. At the federal level the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act (“HIPAA”), governs the privacy and security of health information and imposes an extensive set of requirements on the Company’s health plan management services group, as well as its customers. HIPAA applies to a majority of the
health plan management services group’s operations and requires these businesses to develop sophisticated compliance policies and procedures and contracts to protect against the unauthorized use or disclosure of health information. Many states
have also adopted their own statutory rules for regulating the privacy and security of patient healthcare information and such state regulation is not generally pre-empted by the federal rules unless it is clearly inconsistent with the federal
requirements. In addition to state and federal regulation, various customers require periodic audits of their health plan administrators to confirm compliance with standards of performance and these subsidiaries may be required to forfeit a portion
of their fees if they fail to meet the required performance levels.



As a trust company under Colorado law, Fiserv Trust Company (formerly known as First Trust Corporation
and Lincoln Trust Company) and Trust Industrial Bank, subsidiaries of the Company, are subject to the regulations of the Colorado Division of Banking. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation covers customer deposits of each of the Trust companies.

Employees

Fiserv employs nearly 22,000 specialists in its information management
centers and related product and service companies. This service support network includes employees with backgrounds in computer science and the financial and health industries, often complemented by management and other employees with direct
experience in banks, credit unions, insurance companies and agencies, mortgage firms, savings and other financial services and health services business environments.

Fiserv employees provide expertise in sales and marketing; account management and client services; computer operations,
network control and technical support; programming, software development, modification and maintenance; conversions and client training; and financial planning and related support services.

In supporting international markets, Fiserv works closely with its clients to
help ensure their continued success. Fiserv employees speak the same language as their clients and also understand the differences in the style of doing business, as well as the product requirements and regulations unique to each client and its
specific market.

Fiserv employees are not represented by a
union, and there have been no work stoppages, strikes or organizational attempts. The service nature of the Fiserv business makes its employees an important corporate asset, and while the market for qualified personnel is competitive, the Company
has not experienced significant difficulty with hiring or retaining its staff of top industry professionals. In assessing companies to acquire, the quality and stability of the prospective company’s staff are emphasized.

Fiserv attributes its ability to attract and keep quality employees to, among
other things, the Company’s growth and dedication to state-of-the-art software development tools and hardware technologies.

. The Company is not including the information contained on the Company’s
Website as a part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company makes available free of charge (other than an investor’s own Internet access charges) through its Website its annual reports on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Item 2. Properties

Fiserv
currently operates full-service data centers, software system development centers, and item processing and back-office support centers in over 150 cities. The Company owns 14 facilities; all other buildings in which centers are located are subject
to leases expiring through 2005 and beyond. In addition, the Company maintains its own national data communication network consisting of communications processors and leased lines.

Fiserv believes its facilities and equipment are generally well maintained and are in good operating condition. The Company
believes that the computer equipment it owns and its various facilities are adequate for its present and foreseeable business. Fiserv periodically upgrades its mainframe capability as needed. Fiserv contracts with multiple sites to provide
processing back-up in the event of a disaster and maintains duplicate tapes of data collected and software used in its business in locations away from the Company’s facilities.



Item 3. Legal Proceedings

During
2004, the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiary, Fiserv Securities, Inc. (“FSI”), responded to inquiries from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as part of its industry-wide review of mutual fund trading
practices. FSI has engaged in settlement discussions with the SEC as a result of an SEC investigation of FSI with respect to these matters. As a result of these discussions, FSI has a reserve of $15.5 million recorded at December 31, 2004 with
respect to these matters. A portion of any settlement amount with the SEC may be non-deductible for tax purposes. While no settlement with the SEC has been reached and no assurance can be given that these matters will be settled consistent with the
amounts reserved, the Company does not anticipate any further material liability arising out of the SEC investigation.

In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are named as defendants in various lawsuits in which claims are asserted against the
Company. In the opinion of management, the liabilities, if any, which may ultimately result from such lawsuits are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report, no matter was submitted to a vote of security holders of the Company.
