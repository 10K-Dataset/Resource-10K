SAFE
    HARBOR STATEMENT

UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

This is a “Safe Harbor” Statement under the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This document may
    contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Some of the
    forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of
    forward-looking words such as “believes,”
    “expects,” “potential,”
    “continued,” “may,” “will,”
    “should,” “seeks,”
    “approximately,” “predicts,”
    “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,”
    “anticipates” or the negative version of those words
    or other comparable words. Any forward-looking statements
    contained herein including statements related to our outlook for
    the industry and for our performance for the year 2007 and
    beyond, are based upon our historical performance and on current
    plans, estimates and expectations. The inclusion of this
    forward-looking information should not be regarded as a
    representation by us that the future plans, estimates or
    expectations contemplated by us will be achieved. They are
    subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not
    limited to:

•

the cyclical nature of the property casualty industry;

•

the long-tail and potentially volatile nature of the insurance
    and reinsurance business;

•

product demand and pricing;

•

claims development and the process of estimating reserves;

•

the uncertain nature of damage theories and loss amounts;

•

natural and man-made catastrophic losses, including as a result
    of terrorist activities;

•

the impact of competition;

•

the success of our new ventures or acquisitions and the
    availability of other opportunities;

•

the availability of reinsurance;

•

exposure as to coverage for terrorist acts and our retention
    under The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended
    (“TRIA”), and the potential expiration of TRIA;

•

the ability of our reinsurers to pay reinsurance recoverables
    owed to us;

•

investment risks, including those of our portfolio of fixed
    income securities and investments in equity securities,
    including merger arbitrage investments;

•

exchange rate and political risks relating to our international
    operations;

•

legislative and regulatory developments, including those related
    to alleged anti-competitive or other improper business practices
    in the insurance industry;

•

changes in the ratings assigned to us by rating agencies;

•

availability of dividends from our insurance company
    subsidiaries;

•

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; and

•

other risks detailed from time to time in this

Form 10-K

and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We describe these risks and uncertainties in greater detail in
    Item 1A, Risk Factors. These risks and uncertainties could
    cause our actual results for the year 2007 and beyond to differ
    materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement
    we make. Any projections of growth in our net premiums written
    and management fees would not necessarily result in commensurate
    levels of underwriting and operating profits. Our future
    financial performance is dependent upon factors discussed
    elsewhere in this

Form 10-K

and our other SEC filings. Forward-looking statements speak only
    as of the date on which they are made.



PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

W. R. Berkley Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is an
    insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial
    lines writers in the United States and operates in five segments
    of the property casualty insurance business:

•

Specialty lines of insurance, including excess and surplus
    lines, premises operations, professional liability and
    commercial automobile

•

Regional commercial property casualty insurance

•

Alternative markets, including workers’ compensation and
    the management of self-insurance programs

•

Reinsurance, including treaty, facultative and Lloyd’s
    business

•

International

Our holding company structure provides us with the flexibility
    to respond to local or specific market conditions and to pursue
    specialty business niches. It also allows us to be closer to our
    customers in order to better understand their individual needs
    and risk characteristics. Our structure allows us to capitalize
    on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized
    capital, investment and reinsurance management, and actuarial,
    financial and corporate legal staff support.

Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this

Form 10-K

to “W. R. Berkley,” “we,” “us,”
    “our,” the “Company” or similar terms refer
    to W. R. Berkley Corporation together with its subsidiaries.

Our specialty insurance and reinsurance operations are conducted
    nationwide. Regional insurance operations are conducted
    primarily in the Midwest, Northeast, Southern (excluding Florida
    and Louisiana) and Mid Atlantic regions of the United States.
    Alternative markets operations are conducted throughout the
    United States. International operations are conducted in Europe,
    South America and the Philippines.

Represents personal lines and certain reinsurance lines that
    were discontinued in 2001.

The following sections describe our insurance segments and their
    operating units. These operating units underwrite on behalf of
    one or more affiliated insurance companies within the group
    pursuant to underwriting management agreements. Certain
    operating units are identified by us for descriptive purposes
    only and are not legal entities.

Five of our insurance company subsidiaries, Admiral Insurance
    Company, Nautilus Insurance Company, Admiral Indemnity Company,
    Great Divide Insurance Company, and Clermont Insurance Company,
    have A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”)
    ratings of “A+ (Superior)” which is
    A.M. Best’s second highest rating. All of our other
    domestic insurance and company subsidiaries and W. R. Berkley
    Insurance (Europe), Limited have A.M. Best ratings of
    “A (Excellent)” which is the third highest rating out
    of 15 possible ratings by A.M. Best. A.M. Best’s
    ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders,
    insurance agents and brokers and are not directed toward the
    protection of investors. A.M. Best states: “While
    Best’s Financial Strength Ratings reflect [its] opinion as
    to a company’s financial strength and ability to meet its
    ongoing obligations to policyholders, they are not a warranty,
    nor are they a recommendation of a specific policy form,
    contract, rate or claim practice.” A.M. Best reviews
    its ratings on a periodic basis, and ratings of the
    Company’s subsidiaries are therefore subject to change.

SPECIALTY

Our specialty segment underwrites complex and sophisticated
    third-party liability risks, principally within excess and
    surplus lines. Excess and surplus lines differ from standard
    market lines in that excess and surplus lines are generally free
    of rate and form regulation and provide coverage for more
    complex and

hard-to-place

risks. The primary specialty lines of business are premises
    operations, professional liability, commercial automobile,
    products liability and property lines. The specialty business is
    conducted through nine operating units. The companies within the
    segment are divided along the different customer bases and
    product lines that they serve. The specialty units



deliver their products through a variety of distribution
    channels depending on the customer base and particular risks
    insured. The customers in this segment are highly diverse.

Admiral Insurance Company

(“Admiral”) provides
    excess and surplus lines coverage that generally involves a
    moderate to high degree of hazard due to the nature of the class
    of coverage or type of business insured. Admiral concentrates on
    general liability, professional liability, property, and excess
    and umbrella liability lines of business. Admiral products are
    distributed by wholesale brokers. The average annual premium per

    business is also written through an affiliate, Great Divide

    business is written on a binding authority basis, subject to
    certain contractual limitations. The average annual premium per
    policy was approximately $3,700 in 2006.

Carolina Casualty Insurance Company

(“Carolina”) provides commercial insurance products
    and services to the transportation industry with an emphasis on
    intermediate and long-haul trucking and various classes of
    business and public auto. Carolina operates as an admitted

    surplus lines brokers. Vela also underwrites

    California, through a managing general agency. The average
    annual premium per policy was approximately $76,000 in 2006.

(“Berkley

    products through program administrators and managing general

    underwrites package insurance programs, including workers’
    compensation, for luxury condominium, cooperative and rental
    apartment buildings and restaurants in the New York City and
    Chicago metropolitan areas.

    operations in December 2005, underwrites general and specialty

ALTERNATIVE
    MARKETS

Our alternative markets operations specialize in insuring,
    reinsuring and administering self-insurance programs and other
    alternative risk transfer mechanisms. Our clients include
    employers, employer groups, insurers, and other groups seeking
    alternative ways to manage their exposure to risks. Often, this
    results in our customers choosing to retain more of this risk
    than they might otherwise retain in the traditional insurance
    market. In addition to providing insurance, the alternative
    markets segment also provides a wide variety of fee-based
    services, including claims, administrative and consulting
    services.

Midwest Employers Casualty Company

(“MECC”)
    provides excess workers’ compensation coverage and risk
    management services to self-insured employers and groups. Excess
    workers compensation is coverage above an amount retained, or
    self-insured, by the employer or group and includes large
    deductible and reinsurance programs.



Key Risk Insurance Company

REINSURANCE

Our reinsurance operations consist of seven operating units,
    which specialize in underwriting property casualty reinsurance
    on both a treaty and a facultative basis on behalf of Berkley
    Insurance Company. Treaty reinsurance is the reinsurance of all
    or a specified portion or category of risks underwritten by the
    ceding company during the term of the agreement. Facultative
    reinsurance is the reinsurance of individual risks whereby a
    reinsurer generally has the opportunity to analyze and
    separately underwrite a risk prior to agreeing to be bound.



Signet Star Re, LLC

(“Treaty”) focuses on
    underwriting specialty lines of business, including professional
    liability, umbrella, workers’ compensation, commercial
    automobile and trucking. Signet Star emphasizes casualty excess
    of loss treaties and seeks significant participations in order
    to have greater influence over the terms and conditions of
    coverage. Signet Star business is produced through reinsurance
    brokers or intermediaries as opposed to direct relationships
    with the ceding companies.

Facultative ReSources, Inc.

(“Fac Re”)
    specializes in underwriting individual certificate and program
    facultative business developed through brokers. Its experienced
    underwriters seek to offset the underwriting and pricing cycles
    in the underlying insurance business by working closely with
    ceding company clients to develop appropriate underwriting
    criteria and through superior risk selection.

Lloyd’s of London

(“Lloyd’s”)
    represents a broad range of mainly short-tail classes of
    business, which are written through Lloyd’s.

B F Re Underwriters, LLC.

(“BF Re”) is a direct
    facultative casualty reinsurance underwriting manager that
    serves clients through a nationwide network of regional offices.
    B F Re’s primary lines of business are professional
    liability, excess and surplus, umbrella and medical malpractice.

Berkley Risk Solutions, Inc.

(“Berkley Risk
    Solutions”) underwrites insurance and reinsurance-based
    financial solutions to insurance companies and self-insured
    entities. It also underwrites traditional treaty reinsurance of
    domestic medical malpractice insurers.

Watch Hill Fac Management, LLC

, (“Watch Hill”),
    which commenced operations in 2005, underwrites business on an
    excess of loss basis or, in the case of umbrella business, on a
    contributing excess basis, for most commercial casualty lines of
    business with an emphasis on general liability, products
    liability, construction risks, automobile liability and umbrella.

Berkley Insurance Company — Hong Kong Branch

(“Hong Kong”), which was formed in 2006, provides most

Loss
    and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves

To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, either known or
    unknown, insurers establish reserves, which is a balance sheet
    account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay
    claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which
    have occurred. Estimates and assumptions relating to reserves
    for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective
    judgments, often including the interplay of specific
    uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial
    measurements. Such estimates are also susceptible to change as
    significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of
    an insured loss, the report of the loss to the insurer, the
    ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the
    insurer’s payment of that loss.

In general, when a claim is reported, claims personnel establish
    a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the
    ultimate payment. The estimate represents an informed judgment
    based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience
    and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and
    value of the specific type of claim. Reserves are also
    established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred
    but not reported (“IBNR”) to the insurer, potential
    inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of
    settling claims, including legal



and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims
    adjustment process. Reserves are established based upon the then
    current legal interpretation of coverage provided.

In examining reserve adequacy, several factors are considered in
    addition to the economic value of losses. These factors include
    historical data, legal developments, changes in social attitudes
    and economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. The
    actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past
    experience, adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current
    developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for
    predicting future outcomes. Reserve amounts are necessarily
    based on management’s informed estimates and judgments
    using currently available data. As additional experience and
    other data become available and are reviewed, these estimates
    and judgments may be revised. This may result in reserve
    increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in
    periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed.

Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability.
    Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management
    expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will
    cost. While the methods for establishing the reserves are well
    tested over time, some of the major assumptions about
    anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated
    fluctuation. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial
    projections, are based on management’s assessment of facts
    and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of future
    trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of
    liability and other factors, including the actions of third
    parties which are beyond the Company’s control. These
    variables are affected by internal and external events, such as
    inflation and economic volatility, judicial and litigation
    trends, reinsurance coverage and legislative changes, which make
    it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs. The
    inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for
    certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse
    before a definitive determination of liability is made. Because
    setting reserves is inherently uncertain, the Company cannot
    assure that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of
    subsequent events.

We discount our liabilities for excess workers’
    compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion
    of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time
    over which losses are paid. Discounting is intended to
    appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on
    investment securities supporting the liabilities. The expected
    losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting
    was derived from the Company’s loss payout experience and
    is supplemented with data compiled from insurance companies
    writing similar business. The liabilities for losses and loss
    expenses have been discounted using risk-free discount rates
    determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve
    for non-proportional business, and at the statutory rate for
    proportional business. The discount rates range from 2.7% to
    6.5% with a weighted average rate of 4.7%. The aggregate net
    discount, after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance, is
    $699,883,000, $575,485,000 and $502,874,000 at December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the aggregate
    discount from 2005 to 2006 and from 2004 to 2005 resulted from
    the increase in workers’ compensation gross reserves.

To date, known asbestos and environmental claims at our
    insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on
    our operations. Environmental claims have not materially
    impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did not insure
    the larger industrial companies which are subject to significant
    environmental exposures.

Our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses
    relating to asbestos and environmental claims were $37,473,000
    and $37,453,000 at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The Company’s gross reserves for losses and
    loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental
    claims were $49,937,000 and $53,731,000 at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Net incurred losses and loss
    expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were
    approximately $3,000,000, $1,853,000 and $9,194,000 in 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. Net paid losses and loss expenses
    for reported asbestos and environmental claims were
    approximately $2,980,000, $2,658,000 and $2,802,000 in 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. The estimation of these liabilities
    is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and
    uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable
    actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a
    generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and
    the potential affect of significant unresolved legal matters,
    including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the
    legal issues. Additionally, the determination of ultimate
    damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially
    responsible parties are highly uncertain.

The following table presents the development of net reserves for
    1996 through 2006. The top line of the table shows the estimated
    reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the
    balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This
    represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for
    claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance
    sheet date, including losses that had been incurred but not
    reported to us. The upper portion of the table shows the
    re-estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on
    experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimate
    changes as more information becomes known about the frequency
    and severity of claims for individual years.

The “cumulative redundancy (deficiency)” represents
    the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years. For
    example, the 1996 reserves have developed a $214 million
    redundancy over ten years. That amount has been reflected in
    income over the ten years. The impact on the results of
    operations of the past three years of changes in reserve
    estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above. It should
    be noted that the table presents a “run off” of
    balance sheet reserves, rather than accident or policy year loss
    development. Therefore, each amount in the table includes the
    effects of changes in reserves for all prior years. For example,
    assume a claim that occurred in 1996 is reserved for $2,000 as
    of December 31, 1996. Assuming this claim estimate was
    changed in 2006 to $2,300, and was settled for $2,300 in 2006,
    the $300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year
    from 1996 through 2006.

Reinsurance

We follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of
    our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums
    received on the policies that we write. Reinsurance is purchased
    principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to
    protect against catastrophic losses. Although reinsurance does
    not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for
    the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming
    reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance
    coverage. We monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers
    and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial,
    financially sound carriers. As a result, generally the
    reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an
    A.M. Best rating of “A (Excellent)” or better
    with at least $500 million in policyholder surplus and the
    reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an
    A.M. Best rating of

“A-(Excellent)”

or better with at least $250 million in policyholder
    surplus.

Regulation

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of
    regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do
    business, and the Company believes that it is in compliance in
    all material respects with such regulations. They are subject to
    statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and
    administrative powers to state insurance commissioners. This
    regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency
    which must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and
    their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments;
    deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders;
    approval of certain policy forms and premium rates; periodic
    examination of the affairs of insurance companies; annual and
    other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of
    insurers or for other purposes; establishment and maintenance of
    reserves for unearned premiums and losses; and requirements
    regarding numerous other matters. Our property casualty
    subsidiaries, other than excess and surplus and reinsurance
    subsidiaries, must generally file all rates with the insurance
    department of each state in which they operate. Our excess and
    surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of
    rate and form regulation.

In addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance
    subsidiaries, we are subject to state statutes governing
    insurance holding company systems. Typically, such statutes
    require that we periodically file information with the
    appropriate state insurance commissioner, including information
    concerning our capital structure, ownership,



financial condition and general business operations. Under the
    terms of applicable state statutes, any person or entity
    desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage (commonly
    10%) of our outstanding voting securities would be required to
    obtain regulatory approval of the purchase. Under Florida law,
    which is applicable to us due to our ownership of Carolina
    Casualty Insurance Company, a Florida domiciled insurer, the
    acquisition of more than 5% of our capital stock must receive
    regulatory approval. Further, state insurance statutes typically
    place limitations on the amount of dividends or other
    distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect
    their solvency. See “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Various state and federal organizations, including Congressional
    committees and the National Association of Insurance
    Commissioners (“NAIC”), have been conducting reviews
    into various aspects of the insurance business. No assurance can
    be given that future legislative or regulatory changes resulting
    from such activity will not adversely affect our insurance
    subsidiaries.

The NAIC utilizes a Risk Based Capital (“RBC”) formula
    that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s
    statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its
    business. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level
    of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to
    various asset, premium and reserve items. The RBC Model Law
    provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for
    insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These
    levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer
    to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the
    insurer under regulatory control. The RBC of each of our
    domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized RBC
    control level as of December 31, 2006.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or Financial Services Modernization
    Act of 1999 (the “Act”), was enacted in 1999 and
    significantly affects the financial services industry, including
    insurance companies, banks and securities firms. The Act
    modifies federal law to permit the creation of financial holding
    companies, which, as regulated by the Act, can maintain
    cross-holdings in insurance companies, banks and securities
    firms to an extent not previously allowed. The Act also permits
    or facilitates certain types of combinations or affiliations for
    financial holding companies. The Act establishes a functional
    regulatory scheme under which state insurance departments will
    maintain primary regulation over insurance activities, subject
    to provisions for certain federal preemptions.

Our insurance company subsidiaries are also subject to
    assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a
    particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent
    and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company
    to pay policyholders and claimants. The protection afforded
    under a state’s guaranty fund to policyholders of the
    insolvent insurer varies from state to state. Generally, all
    licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members
    of the fund, and assessments are based upon their pro rata share
    of direct written premiums. The NAIC Model Post-Assessment
    Guaranty Fund Act, which many states have adopted, limits
    assessments to an insurer to 2% of its subject premium and
    permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting.
    Likewise, several states (or underwriting organizations of which
    our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members) have
    limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain
    lines of business.

We receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the
    form of dividends and management fees for certain management
    services. Annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts
    prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the
    approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an
    insurance subsidiary is domiciled.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 became effective
    November 26, 2002 and was amended on December 22, 2005
    by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 (together,
    “TRIA”). TRIA establishe a temporary Federal program
    that provides for a system of shared public and private
    compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of
    terrorism. The program is scheduled to terminate on
    December 31, 2007. TRIA is applicable to almost all
    commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes
    commercial auto, burglary and theft, surety, professional
    liability and farm owners multi-peril insurance. Insurers with
    direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in
    the United States are required to participate in the program and
    make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism. Federal
    participation will be triggered under TRIA when the Secretary of
    Treasury certifies an act of terrorism. Under the program, the
    federal government will pay 85% in 2007 of an insurer’s
    covered losses in excess of the insurer’s applicable
    deductible. The insurer’s deductible is based on a percent
    of earned premium for covered lines of commercial property and
    casualty insurance: for 2007 it will be 20%



of 2006 premium. Based on our 2006 earned premiums, our
    deductible under TRIA during 2007 will increase to approximately
    $618 million. As of 2007, the federal program will not pay
    losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed
    $100 million. TRIA limits the federal government’s
    share of losses at $100 billion for a program year. In
    addition, an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not
    liable for the payment of losses in excess of the
    $100 billion cap. After December 31, 2007, there will
    not be a federal program available for terrorism losses unless
    TRIA is further extended or replaced. At such time, the Company
    will have the option to exclude terrorism losses from coverage,
    except for any lines of insurance or jurisdictions where
    exclusions are not permitted.

The insurance industry recently has become the subject of
    increasing scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent
    compensation arrangements and sales practices. The New York
    State Attorney General and other state and federal regulators
    have commenced investigations and other proceedings relating to
    compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and
    issuers of insurance products, and alleged unsuitable sales
    practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or the
    purchaser. The practices currently under investigation include,
    among other things, allegations that so-called contingent
    commission arrangements may conflict with a broker’s duties
    to its customers and that certain brokers and insurers may have
    engaged in anti-competitive practices in connection with
    insurance premium quotes. The New York State Attorney General
    has entered into settlement agreements with several large
    insurance brokers and insurance companies. These investigations
    and proceedings are expected to continue, and new investigative
    proceedings may be commenced, in the future. These
    investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents
    and new industry-wide practices or legislation, rules or
    regulations that could significantly affect the insurance
    industry and the Company. Following the public disclosure of the
    New York State Attorney General’s investigation, the
    Company commenced an internal review with the assistance of
    outside counsel that focused on the Company’s relationships
    with its distribution channels. As a result of its
    investigation, the Company uncovered at a single insurance
    operating unit certain limited instances of conduct that could
    be characterized as involving inappropriate solicitation
    practices. That operating unit has reached an agreement with its
    domiciliary insurance regulator resolving all issues pertaining
    to such regulator’s inquiry without penalty.

Competition

The property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are
    competitive, with over 2,000 insurance companies transacting
    business in the United States. We compete directly with a large
    number of these companies. Our strategy in this highly
    fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic
    regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive
    advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions.
    Our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices. Such
    practices are based upon a Company-wide philosophy to price
    products with the intent of making an underwriting profit.
    Competition in the industry generally changes with profitability.

Competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes
    from other specialty insurers, regional carriers, large national
    multi-line companies and reinsurers. Under certain market
    conditions, standard carriers also compete for excess and
    surplus business.

Competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and
    foreign reinsurers, which produce their business either on a
    direct basis or through the broker market. These competitors
    include Berkshire Hathaway, Swiss Re, Transatlantic Reinsurance
    and Everest Reinsurance.

The regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual
    and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers.
    Direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with the
    regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their
    salaried employees, generally at a lower cost than through
    independent agents such as those used by the Company.

The international operations compete with native insurance
    operations both large and small, which may be related to
    government entities, as well as with branch or local
    subsidiaries of multinational companies.

Competition from Bermuda and other tax advantaged jurisdictions
    has increased over the last several years, including from
    domestic based subsidiaries of foreign based entities.



Employees

As of February 14, 2007, we employed 5,429 persons. Of this
    number, our subsidiaries employed 5,354 persons, of whom 3,610
    were executive and administrative personnel and 1,744 were
    clerical personnel. We employed the remaining 75 persons at the
    parent company and in investment operations, of whom 60 were
    executive and administrative personnel and 15 were clerical
    personnel.

Other
    Information about the Company’s business

We maintain an interest in the acquisition or start up of
    complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible
    acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis. In addition,
    our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of
    business to meet the needs of insureds.

Seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity
    and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and
    reinsurance subsidiaries. Although the effect on our business of
    such catastrophes as tornadoes, hurricanes, hailstorms,
    earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance,
    they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results
    of any one or more reporting periods.

We have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more
    of our consolidated revenues.

Compliance by W. R. Berkley and its subsidiaries with federal,
    state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted
    regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or
    otherwise relating to protection of the environment has not had
    a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or
    competitive position.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

CERTAIN
    FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

Our business faces significant risks. If any of the events or
    circumstances described as risks below actually occurs, our
    business, results of operations or financial condition could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Risks
    Relating to Our Industry

Our
    results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including
    cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance
    industry.

The results of companies in the property casualty insurance
    industry historically have been subject to significant
    fluctuations and uncertainties. The demand for insurance is
    influenced primarily by general economic conditions, while the
    supply of insurance is directly related to available capacity.
    The adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity
    and frequency of claims, which are influenced by many factors,
    including natural disasters, regulatory measures and court
    decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the
    effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due
    for injuries or losses. In addition, investment rates of return
    may impact policy rates. These factors can have a significant
    impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty
    insurance policy is priced before its costs are known, as
    premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported.
    These factors could produce results that would have a negative
    impact on our results of operations and financial condition.



Our
    actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, which
    may require us to establish additional reserves.

Our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were
    approximately $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2006.
    Our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of
    settling all claims and related expenses with respect to insured
    events that have occurred.

Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability.
    Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management
    expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will
    cost for claims that have occurred, whether known or unknown.
    The major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns
    are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. These estimates, which
    generally involve actuarial projections, are based on
    management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then
    known, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity
    and frequency, inflation, judicial theories of liability,
    reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and other factors,
    including the actions of third parties which are beyond our
    control.

The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater
    for certain types of liabilities, where long periods of time
    elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made
    and settlement is reached. In periods with increased economic
    volatility, it becomes more difficult to accurately predict
    claim costs. Reserve estimates are continually refined in an
    ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are
    reported and settled. Adjustments to reserves are reflected in
    the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed.
    Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain, we cannot
    assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of
    subsequent events. Should we need to increase our reserves, our
    pre-tax income for the period would decrease by a corresponding
    amount.

We increased our estimates for claims occurring in prior years
    by $27 million in 2006, $187 million in 2005 and
    $295 million in 2004. We, along with the property casualty
    insurance industry in general, have experienced higher than
    expected losses for certain types of business written from 1998
    to 2001. Although our reserves reflect our best estimate of the
    costs of settling claims, we cannot assure you that our claim
    estimates will not need to be increased in the future.

We discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers’
    compensation business because of the long period of time over
    which losses are paid. Discounting is intended to appropriately
    match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment
    securities supporting liabilities. The expected loss and loss
    expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from
    our loss payout experience and is supplemented with data
    compiled from insurance companies writing similar business.
    Changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded
    in the period they are determined. If the actual loss payout
    pattern is shorter than anticipated, the discount will be
    reduced and pre-tax income will decrease by a corresponding
    amount.

As a
    property casualty insurer, we face losses from natural and
    man-made catastrophes.

Property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of
    catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results
    of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Catastrophe
    losses have had a significant impact on our results. In
    addition, through our recent quota share arrangements with
    certain Lloyd’s syndicates, we have additional exposure to
    catastrophic losses. For example, weather-related losses were
    $39 million in 2006, $99 million in 2005 and
    $60 million in 2004.

Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including
    hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions,
    severe winter weather and fires, as well as terrorist
    activities. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are
    inherently unpredictable but have increased in recent years. The
    extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the
    total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the
    event and the severity of the event. Some catastrophes are
    restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes and
    earthquakes may produce significant damage in large, heavily
    populated areas. Catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of
    our property casualty lines, and most of our past
    catastrophe-related claims have resulted from severe storms.
    Seasonal weather variations may affect the severity and
    frequency of our losses. Insurance companies are not permitted
    to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred. It is
    therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple
    catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a
    material adverse effect on our results of operations and
    financial condition.



We
    face significant competitive pressures in our businesses, which
    may reduce premium rates and prevent us from pricing our
    products at attractive rates.

We compete with a large number of other companies in our
    selected lines of business. We compete, and will continue to
    compete, with major U.S. and

non-U.S. insurers

and reinsurers, other regional companies, as well as mutual
    companies, specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies
    and diversified financial services companies. Competition in our
    businesses is based on many factors, including the perceived
    financial strength of the company, premium charges, other terms
    and conditions offered, services provided, commissions paid to
    producers, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies,
    speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the
    lines to be written.

Some of our competitors, particularly in the reinsurance
    business, have greater financial and marketing resources than we
    do. These competitors within the reinsurance segment include
    Berkshire Hathaway, Swiss Re, Transatlantic Reinsurance and
    Everest Reinsurance Company. We expect that perceived financial
    strength, in particular, will become more important as customers
    seek high quality reinsurers. Certain of our competitors operate
    from tax advantaged or less regulated jurisdictions that may
    provide them with competitive advantages.

New competition could cause the supply

and/or

demand for insurance or reinsurance to change, which could
    affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates.

We, as
    a primary insurer, may have significant exposure for terrorist
    acts.

To the extent an act of terrorism is certified by the Secretary
    of Treasury, we may be covered under the Terrorism Risk
    Insurance Act of 2002, as amended on December 22, 2005
    (“TRIA”), for up to 90% in 2006 85% in 2007 of our
    losses for certain property/casualty lines of insurance.
    However, any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory
    deductible based on a percent of earned premium for the covered
    lines of commercial property and casualty insurance. Based on
    our 2006 earned premiums, our deductible under TRIA during 2007
    will increase to approximately $618 million which is a
    result of an increase in premium and an increase in the
    applicable deductible percentage from 17.5% in 2006 to 20.0% in
    2007. In addition, even the coverage provided under TRIA is
    scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2007 unless extended
    or replaced by a similar program. This coverage provided under
    TRIA does not apply to reinsurance that we write.

We are
    subject to extensive governmental regulation, which increases
    our costs and could restrict the conduct of our
    business.

We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and
    supervision. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect
    the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and
    other investors. This system of regulation, generally
    administered by a department of insurance in each state in which
    we do business, relates to, among other things:

•

standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;

•

restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of
    investments;

•

requiring certain methods of accounting;

•

rate and form regulation pertaining to certain of our insurance
    businesses; and

•

potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for
    the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided
    by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies.

State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the
    affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual
    and other reports relating to the financial condition of
    insurance companies, holding company issues and other matters.
    Recently adopted federal financial services modernization
    legislation may lead to additional federal regulation of the
    insurance industry in the coming years. Also, foreign
    governments regulate our international operations.

The insurance industry recently has become the subject of
    increasing scrutiny with respect to insurance broker and agent
    compensation arrangements and sales practices. The New York
    State Attorney General and other state



and federal regulators have commenced investigations and other
    proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements
    between producers and issuers of insurance products, and alleged
    unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the
    issuer or the purchaser. The practices currently under
    investigation include, among other things, allegations that
    contingent commission arrangements may conflict with a
    broker’s duties to its customers and that certain brokers
    and insurers may have engaged in anti-competitive practices in
    connection with insurance premium quotes. The New York State
    Attorney General has entered into settlement agreements with
    several large insurance brokers and insurance companies. These
    investigations and proceedings are expected to continue, and new
    investigative proceedings may be commenced, in the future. These
    investigations and proceedings could result in legal precedents
    and new industry-wide practices or legislation, rules or
    regulations that could significantly affect the insurance
    industry and the Company. For example, following the public
    disclosure of the New York State Attorney General’s
    investigation, the Company commenced an internal review with the
    assistance of outside counsel that focused on the Company’s
    relationships with its distribution channels. As a result of its
    investigation, the Company uncovered at a single insurance
    operating unit certain limited instances of conduct that could
    be characterized as involving inappropriate solicitation
    practices. That operating unit has reached an agreement with its
    domiciliary insurance regulator resolving all issues pertaining
    to such regulator’s inquiry without penalty. We cannot
    assure you that regulators will not make further inquiries in
    the future.

We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals
    and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of
    applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s
    interpretation of the laws and regulations. Also, some
    regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to
    grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have
    the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with
    applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory
    authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from
    carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize
    us. Also, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance
    industry, whether federal, state or foreign, or changes in laws
    or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory
    authorities, restrict the conduct of our business.

In certain of our insurance businesses, the rates we charge our
    policyholders are subject to regulatory approval. Certain lines
    of business are subject to a greater degree of regulatory
    scrutiny then others. For example, the workers’
    compensation business is highly regulated. During 2006,
    approximately 19% of our net premiums written represented
    primary workers’ compensation business. Of our net premiums
    written, approximately 3% represented primary workers’
    compensation business written in the State of California, where
    the impact of workers compensation reform has resulted in
    significant reductions.

Risks
    Relating to Our Business

We
    cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely
    fashion, if at all, and, as a result, we could experience
    losses.

We purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we
    have assumed, known as ceding, to a reinsurance company in
    exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with
    the risk. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us
    to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer,
    it does not relieve us, the reinsured, of our liability to our
    policyholders. Our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance
    recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such
    recoverables on a timely basis. Accordingly, we bear credit risk
    with respect to our reinsurers, and if our reinsurers fail to
    pay us, our financial results would be adversely affected.
    Underwriting results and investment returns of some of our
    reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims. As of
    December 31, 2006, the amount due from our reinsurers was
    $928 million, including amounts due from state funds and
    industry pools. Certain of these amounts due from reinsurers are
    secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our
    behalf.

We are
    rated by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s, and
    Moody’s, and a decline in these ratings could affect our
    standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and
    earnings to decrease.

Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in
    establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.
    Certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by
    A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s
    Investors Services. While A.M. Best, Standard &
    Poor’s and Moody’s ratings reflect their opinions as
    to a



company’s financial strength, operating performance,
    strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to
    policyholders, they are not evaluations directed to investors
    and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities.
    Our ratings are subject to periodic review, and we cannot assure
    you that we will be able to retain those ratings. Five of our
    insurance subsidiaries, Admiral Insurance Company, Nautilus
    Insurance Company, Admiral Indemnity Company, Great Divide
    Insurance Company and Clermont Insurance Company, have
    A.M. Best ratings of “A+ (Superior)”, which is
    A.M. Best’s second highest rating. All of our other
    domestic insurance subsidiaries and W. R. Berkley Insurance
    (Europe), Limited have A.M. Best ratings of “A
    (Excellent)”, which is the third highest rating out of 15
    possible ratings by A. M. Best. The Standard &
    Poor’s financial strength rating for our domestic insurance
    subsidiaries is A+ (the seventh highest rating out of
    twenty-seven possible ratings). Our Moody’s rating is A2
    for Berkley Insurance Company (the sixth highest rating out of
    twenty-one possible ratings).

If our ratings are reduced from their current levels by
    A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s,
    our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer
    and it would be more difficult for us to market our products. A
    significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of
    business as policyholders move to other companies with higher
    claims-paying and financial strength ratings.

If
    market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or
    unavailable, we may be required to bear increased risks or
    reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.

As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we
    purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by
    our insurance company subsidiaries, especially catastrophe
    risks. We also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by
    others which we reinsure. Market conditions beyond our control
    determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance
    protection we purchase, which may affect the level of our
    business and profitability. Our reinsurance facilities are
    generally subject to annual renewal. We may be unable to
    maintain our current reinsurance facilities or to obtain other
    reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable
    rates. If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to
    obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures
    would increase or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in
    net exposures, we would have to reduce the level of our
    underwriting commitments, especially catastrophe exposed risks.

Our
    international operations expose us to investment, political and
    economic risks.

Our international operations expose us to investment, political
    and economic risks, including foreign currency and credit risk.
    Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other
    currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of
    operations and financial condition.

We may
    not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance
    ventures and even if we do, we may not successfully integrate
    any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such
    ventures.

As part of our present strategy, we continue to evaluate
    possible acquisition transactions and the

start-up

of
    complementary businesses on an ongoing basis, and at any given
    time, we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible
    acquisitions and new ventures. We cannot assure that we will be
    able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance
    ventures, that such transactions will be financed and completed
    on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures
    will be successful. The process of integrating any companies we
    do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
    condition.

We may
    be unable to attract and retain qualified
    employees.

We depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced
    underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are
    knowledgeable about our business. If the quality of our
    underwriting team and other personnel decreases, we may be
    unable to maintain our current competitive position in the
    specialized markets in which we operate, and be unable to expand
    our operations into new markets.



Risks
    Relating to Our Investments

A
    significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed income
    securities and is subject to market fluctuations.

Our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed income
    securities. As of December 31, 2006, our investment in
    fixed income securities was approximately $9.2 billion, or
    82% of our total investment portfolio.

The fair market value of these assets and the investment income
    from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and
    market conditions. The fair market value of fixed income
    securities generally decreases as interest rates rise.
    Conversely, if interest rates decline, investment income earned
    from future investments in fixed income securities will be
    lower. In addition, some fixed income securities, such as
    mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, carry
    prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations. Based
    upon the composition and duration of our investment portfolio at
    December 31, 2006, a 100 basis point increase in
    interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of
    our investments of approximately $300 million.

The value of investments in fixed income securities, and
    particularly our investments in high-yield securities, is
    subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit
    worthiness of the issuer or increases in market interest rates.
    Although we attempt to manage this risk by diversifying our
    portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal, our
    investments are subject to losses as a result of a general
    decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry
    sector in which we invest, as well as risks inherent in
    particular securities.

We
    invest some of our assets in equity securities, including merger
    arbitrage investments and real estate securities, which may
    decline in value.

We invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity
    securities, including merger arbitrage investments and
    investments in affiliates. At December 31, 2006, our
    investments in equity securities were approximately
    $2.0 billion, or 18% of our investment portfolio. We
    reported provisions for other than temporary impairments in the
    value of our equity securities provisions in the amounts of
    $0.1 million in 2006, $1.6 million in 2005 and
    $2.8 million in 2004.

Merger and convertible arbitrage trading securities represented
    33% of our equity securities at December 31, 2006. Merger
    arbitrage is the business of investing in the securities of
    publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender
    offers and mergers. Merger arbitrage differs from other types of
    investments in its focus on transactions and events believed
    likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short
    time period, usually four months or less. Our merger arbitrage
    positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion
    of announced deals, which are subject to regulatory as well as
    political and other risks. If there is reduced activity in the
    merger and acquisitions area, we may not be able achieve the
    returns that we have enjoyed in the past.

Included in our equity security portfolio are investments in
    publicly traded real estate investment trusts
    (“REITs”) and private real estate investment funds,
    real estate limited partnerships and venture capital
    investments. At December 31, 2006 our investments in these
    securities were approximately $549 million, or 28% of our
    equity portfolio. The values of our real estate investments are
    subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy in
    general and real estate valuations in particular. In addition,
    the real estate investment funds, limited partnerships, and
    venture capital investments in which we invest are less liquid
    than our other investments.

Risks
    Relating to Purchasing Our Securities

We are
    an insurance holding company and may not be able to receive
    dividends in needed amounts.

As an insurance holding company, our principal assets are the
    shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries.
    We have to rely on dividends from our insurance company
    subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and
    interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying
    dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses. The payment of
    dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to
    regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and
    future earnings of these subsidiaries, as well as the regulatory
    restrictions. During 2007, the maximum amount of dividends that
    can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately $603



million. As a result, in the future we may not be able to
    receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in
    amounts necessary to meet our obligations or pay dividends.

We are
    subject to certain provisions that may have the effect of
    hindering, delaying or preventing third party takeovers, which
    may prevent our shareholders from receiving premium prices for
    their shares in an unsolicited takeover and make it more
    difficult for third parties to replace our current
    management.

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as
    well as our rights agreement and state insurance statutes, may
    hinder, delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of
    our control. These provisions may also have the effect of making
    it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of
    our current management without the concurrence of our board of
    directors.

These provisions include:

•

our classified board of directors and the ability of our board
    to increase its size and to appoint directors to fill newly
    created directorships;

•

the requirement that 80% of our stockholders must approve
    mergers and other transactions between us and the holder of 5%
    or more of our shares, unless the transaction was approved by
    our board of directors prior to such holder’s acquisition
    of 5% of our shares;

•

the need for advance notice in order to raise business or make
    nominations at stockholders’ meetings;

•

our rights agreement which subject persons (other than William
    R. Berkley) who acquire beneficial ownership of 15% or more of
    our common stock without board approval to substantial
    dilution; and

•

state insurance statutes that restrict the acquisition of
    control (generally defined as 5 — 10% of the
    outstanding shares) of an insurance company without regulatory
    approval.

    and 939,000 were leased.

Rental expense was approximately $19,348,000, $17,429,000 and
    $16,783,000 for 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively. Future minimum
    lease payments (without provision for sublease income) are
    $18,279,000 in 2007, $16,687,000 in 2008 and $49,137,000
    thereafter.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

The Company’s subsidiaries are subject to disputes,
    including litigation and arbitration, arising in the ordinary
    course of their insurance and reinsurance businesses. The
    Company’s estimates of the costs of settling such matters
    are reflected in its aggregate reserves for losses and loss
    expenses, and the Company does not believe that the ultimate
    outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on
    its financial condition or results of operations.

    consolidated financial statements and our report thereon are
    incorporated by reference in the December 31, 2006 Annual
