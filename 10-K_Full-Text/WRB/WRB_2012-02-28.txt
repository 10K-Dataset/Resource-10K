PART I

ITEM  1.  BUSINESS

W. R. Berkley Corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the United States.  It operates in the following segments of the property casualty insurance business:

•

Specialty,

including excess and surplus lines and admitted specialty lines;

•

Regional

commercial lines property casualty;

•

Alternative Markets,

including excess workers' compensation, monoline workers' compensation, accident and   health, and insurance services;

•

Reinsurance,

on both a facultative and treaty basis and participating in business written through Lloyd's of London; and

•

International

business in selected regions throughout the world.

Each of our five business segments is comprised of individual operating units that serve a market defined by geography, products, services or types of customers. Each of our operating units is positioned close to its customer base and participates in a niche market requiring specialized knowledge about a territory or product.  This strategy of decentralized operations allows each of our units to identify and respond quickly and effectively to changing market conditions and local customer needs, while capitalizing on the benefits of centralized capital, investment and reinsurance management, and corporate actuarial, financial, enterprise risk management and legal staff support.

Our business approach is focused on meeting the needs of our customers, maintaining a high quality balance sheet, and allocating capital to our best opportunities.  New businesses are started when opportunities are identified and when the right talent and expertise are found to lead a business.  Of the Company's 45 operating units, 38 have been organized and developed internally and seven have been added through acquisition.

Our Specialty insurance and Reinsurance operations are conducted throughout the United States, and, on a limited basis, outside the United States. Regional insurance operations are conducted across the continental United States in five regions: the Midwest, Northeast, South (excluding Florida and Louisiana), Mid Atlantic, and North Pacific regions.  Alternative Markets operations are conducted throughout the United States.  Our International operations are conducted primarily in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, South America, Australia, the Asia Pacific region, Scandinavia and Canada.

Net premiums written, as reported based on United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), for each of our operating segments for each of the past five years were as follows:


Twenty-six of our twenty-seven insurance company subsidiaries rated by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”) have ratings of A+ (Superior) (the second highest rating out of 15 possible ratings), and one is rated A (Excellent) (the third highest rating). A.M. Best's ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders, insurance agents and brokers and are not directed toward the protection of investors. A.M. Best states: “The Financial Strength Rating opinion addresses the relative ability of an insurer to meet its ongoing insurance obligations. The ratings are not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and do not address any other risk.” A.M. Best reviews its ratings on a periodic basis, and its ratings of the Company's subsidiaries are therefore subject to change.

Twenty-two of our twenty-three insurance company subsidiaries rated by Standard & Poor's (“S&P”) have financial strength ratings of A+ (the seventh highest rating out of twenty-seven possible ratings), and one is rated A (the eighth highest rating).

Our Moody's ratings are A2 for Berkley Insurance Company, Berkley Regional Insurance Company and Admiral Insurance Company (the sixth highest rating out of twenty-one possible ratings).

The following sections describe our reporting segments and their operating units in greater detail. These operating units underwrite on behalf of one or more affiliated insurance companies within the group pursuant to underwriting management agreements.  Certain operating units are identified by us herein for descriptive purposes only and are not legal entities.  Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this Form 10-K to “W. R. Berkley,” “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or similar terms refer to W. R. Berkley Corporation together with its subsidiaries.  W. R. Berkley Corporation is a Delaware corporation formed in 1970.

Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves

To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, either known or unknown, insurers establish reserves, which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred. Estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments, often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements. Such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the report of the loss to the insurer, the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss.

In general, when a claim is reported, claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time. The estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim. Reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) to the insurer, potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process. Reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided.

In examining reserve adequacy, several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses. These factors include, among others, historical data, legal developments, changes in social attitudes and economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. The actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. Reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data. As additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, these estimates and judgments may be revised. This may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed.

The risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain. It is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions. Whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation, increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation. A change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed.

Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost. While the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time, some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors, including the actions of third parties, which are beyond the Company’s control. These variables are affected by external and internal events, such as inflation and economic volatility, judicial and litigation trends, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices, which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs. The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Although the loss reserves included in the Company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates, setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.

We discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid. Discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities. The expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the Company’s loss payout experience. For non-proportional business, reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using risk-free discount rates determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. These discount rates range from

2.3%

to

6.5%

with a weighted average discount rate of

4.3%

. For proportional business, reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware of

2.3%

. The aggregate net discount, after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance, is

$892 million

,

$898 million

and

$877 million

at

December 31, 2011

, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

To date, known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations. These claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which were subject to significant asbestos or environmental exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute pollution exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language.

Our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were

$34 million

and

$36 million

at

December 31, 2011

and 2010, respectively. The Company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment


expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were

$59 million

and

$51 million

at

December 31, 2011

and


, respectively. Net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims increased (decreased) by approximately

$1 million

,

$2 million

and

$(0.6) million

in


,


and


, respectively. Net paid losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately

$3 million

in each of


,


and


.  The estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters, including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues. Additionally, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain.

The table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years (amounts in thousands):

For certain retrospectively rated insurance polices and reinsurance agreements, reserve development is offset by additional or return premiums. Favorable reserve development, net of additional and return  premiums, was

$182 million

$234 million

and

$190 million

in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Also, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further information regarding the decrease in estimates for claims occurring in prior years.

A reconciliation between the reserves as of

December 31, 2011

as reported in the accompanying consolidated GAAP financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles (“SAP”) in the Company’s U.S. regulatory filings is as follows (amounts in thousands):

(1)   For statutory purposes, the Company discounts its workers’ compensation reinsurance reserves at

2.3%

as permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware. In its GAAP financial statements, the Company discounts excess workers’ compensation reserves at the risk-free rate and assumed workers’ compensation reserves at the statutory rate.


The following table presents the development of net reserves for 2001 through 2011. The top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date, including losses that had been incurred but not reported to us. The upper portion of the table shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years.

The “cumulative redundancy (deficiency)” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years. The impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above. It should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves, rather than accident or policy year loss development. Therefore, each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years. For example, assume a claim that occurred in 2001 is reserved for $2,000 as of December 31, 2001. Assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2011 to $2,300, and was settled for $2,300 in 2011, the $300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 2001 through 2011.


The following table presents the development of gross reserves for 2001 through 2011.

Reinsurance

We follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies that we write. Reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage. We monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial, financially sound carriers. As a result, generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “A (Excellent)” or better with at least $500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “A-(Excellent)” or better with at least $250 million in policyholder surplus.

Regulation

U.S. Regulation

Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business.

Overview

.  Our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners. This regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of certain policy forms and premium rates; periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes; establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums, loss expenses and losses; and requirements regarding numerous other matters. Our property casualty subsidiaries, other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries, must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate. Our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation.

Holding Company Statutes

. In addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries, we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems. Typically, such statutes require that we periodically file


information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations. Under the terms of applicable state statutes, any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage (commonly 10%) of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase. Under Alabama law, which is applicable to us due to our ownership of American Mining Insurance Company, Inc., an Alabama domiciled insurance company, the acquisition of more than 5% of our capital stock is subject to prior regulatory approval.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has recently adopted amendments to the model holding company law, expanding upon the regulation of holding company systems. When and if adopted by the various states, these laws and regulations may have additional impact upon the Company's operations.

Risk Based Capital Requirements

. The NAIC utilizes a Risk Based Capital (“RBC”) formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. The NAIC RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The RBC of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized RBC control level as of December 31, 2011.

Insurance Regulatory Information System

.   The NAIC also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios referred to as the Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”). On the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators, the NAIC annually calculates these IRIS ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. The NAIC has established an acceptable range for each of the IRIS financial ratios.

Guaranty Funds

.  Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants. The protection afforded under a state's guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state. Generally, all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund, and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums. The NAIC Model Post-Assessment Guaranty Fund Act, which many states have adopted, limits assessments to an insurer to 2% of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting. Likewise, several states (or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members) have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business.

Additionally, state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory property-liability “shared market,” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers. Shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “FAIR” plans. In addition, some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts. Our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state.

Excess and Surplus Lines

. The regulation of our U.S. subsidiaries' excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business. Our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance. Although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business, strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future. Federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future.

Dividends

.  We receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services. Annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled.  See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Trade Practices

.  State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices


and the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing marketing and sales practices, policyholder services, claims management and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.

Investment Regulation.

Investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments.  In general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended (collectively, “TRIA”), established a Federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. The program is effective through December 31, 2014. TRIA is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty insurance but excludes commercial auto, burglary and theft, surety, professional liability and farm owners' multi-peril insurance. Insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the United States are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism. The most recent amendment to TRIA broadened the definition of certified acts to include domestic terrorism. Federal participation will be triggered under TRIA when the Secretary of Treasury certifies an act of terrorism. Under the program, the federal government will pay 85% of an insurer's covered losses in excess of the insurer's applicable deductible. The insurer's deductible is based on 20% percent of earned premium for the prior year for covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance. Based on our 2011 earned premiums, our deductible under TRIA during 2012 will be approximately $542 million. The federal program will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed $100 million. TRIA limits the federal government's share of losses at $100 billion for a program year.  In addition, an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the $100 billion cap.

Federal Regulation.

Although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance, federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways.   In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which effects sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the United States.  The Dodd-Frank Act created two new federal government bodies, the Federal Insurance Office (the “FIO”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the “FSOC”), which may impact the regulation of insurance.  Although the FIO is prohibited from directly regulating the business of insurance, it has authority to represent the United States in international insurance matters and has limited powers to preempt certain types of state insurance laws. The FIO also can recommend to the FSOC that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the United States financial stability in the event of the insurer's material financial distress or failure.  An insurer so designated by FSOC could be subject to Federal Reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards.  Based upon our current business model and balance sheet, we do not believe that we will be designated by the FSOC as such an institution.  Although the potential impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act on the U. S. insurance industry is not clear, our business could be affected by changes to the U.S. system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant non-bank financial companies.

In addition, as a result of its direct majority ownership interest in Peyton Street Independent Financial Services Corporation, a thrift holding company (“Peyton Street”), and indirect majority ownership stake in InsurBanc, a federal savings bank (“InsurBanc”), W. R. Berkley Corporation is a “grandfathered savings and loan holding company” and, under the Dodd-Frank Act, is subject to the oversight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”).  As a grandfathered savings and loan holding company, W. R. Berkley Corporation may be subject to certain requirements and restrictions, including those related to its shareholders, management reporting, capital adequacy, dividends and distributions, transactions with affiliates and compensation plans.  As Peyton Street's and InsurBanc's operations are currently immaterial to W. R. Berkley's business and results of operations, we are currently pursuing various alternatives in order to terminate W. R. Berkley Corporation's status as a grandfathered savings and loan holding company.

International Regulation

Our insurance subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom are regulated by the Financial Services Authority (the “FSA”).  The FSA oversees compliance with established periodic auditing and reporting requirements, risk assessment reviews, minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements, dividend restrictions, restrictions governing the appointment of key officers, restrictions governing controlling ownership interests and various other


requirements. Our Lloyd's syndicate is also regulated by the FSA and Lloyd's.  Through Lloyd's, we are licensed to write business throughout the world by virtue of Lloyd's international licenses.  In each such country, we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country.  Additionally, FSA regulations also impact us as “controller” (an FSA defined term) of our U.K.-regulated subsidiaries.  Through the FSA's Approved Persons regime, certain employees and directors are subject to regulation by the FSA of their fitness and certain employees are individually registered at Lloyd's.

The European Union's executive body, the European Commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called “Solvency II” that would apply to our businesses across the European Union beginning as soon as the first quarter of 2013.  Solvency II provides for the supervision of group solvency. Under Solvency II, it is possible that the U.S. parent of a European Union subsidiary could be subject to certain Solvency II requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiary's capital position is dependent on the parent company and the U.S. company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to Solvency II.  While it is not certain how or if these actions will impact us, we do not currently expect the capital management strategies for our U.S. and international companies will be materially impacted.

Our international underwriting subsidiaries are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in certain countries in Continental Europe, South America, Australia, Southeast Asia and Canada.  Generally, our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. Key areas where country regulations may differ include: (i) the type of financial reports to be filed; (ii) a requirement to use local intermediaries; (iii) the amount of reinsurance permissible; (iv) the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates; and (v) the type and frequency of regulatory examinations.

Competition

The property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive, with many insurance companies of various sizes, as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as self-insured retentions or captive programs, transacting business in the United States and internationally. We compete directly with a large number of these companies.  Competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer.  Our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions.  Our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices based upon a Company-wide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit.  As a result of increased competition, since 2004 we have generally been experiencing both downward pressure on pricing for many of our insurance lines as well as demands by insureds and cedants for better terms and conditions.  However, in 2011 rates and terms in the United States and international markets were generally stable and/or showed modest improvements, although certain products continue to experience strong competition.

Competition for Specialty and Alternative Markets business comes from other specialty insurers, regional carriers, large national multi-line companies and reinsurers. Over the last few years, many of our Specialty companies have reduced their writing substantially as standard carriers had increasingly competed for excess and surplus business, although this trend moderated in 2011.

Competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers, which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market.  These competitors include Swiss Re, Munich Re, Berkshire Hathaway, Transatlantic Reinsurance, and Partner Re.  Additionally, in recent years our reinsurance writings have reduced substantially as many ceding companies elected to retain more business and the business available has been more competitive.

Our Regional subsidiaries compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers.  Additionally, direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their salaried employees, generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the Company.

Our International operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small, which in some cases are related to government entities, as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies.

Additionally, competition from insurers and reinsurers based in Bermuda and other tax advantaged jurisdictions


continues to increase, including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreign based entities in the excess and surplus lines businesses.

Employees

As of February 16, 2012, we employed 6,642 individuals. Of this number, our subsidiaries employed 6,537 persons and the remaining 105 persons were employed at the parent company.

Other Information about the Company's Business

We maintain an interest in the acquisition and startup of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis. In addition, our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds.

Seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. Although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes, hurricanes, hailstorms, earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance, they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods.

We have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues.

Compliance by W. R. Berkley and its subsidiaries with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

ITEM  1A.   RISK FACTORS

Our businesses face significant risks. If any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs, our businesses, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.  In addition to those described below, our businesses may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial.

Risks Relating to Our Industry

Our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry.

The results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties. The demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic conditions, while the supply of insurance is often directly related to available capacity or the perceived profitability of the business.  In recent years, we have faced increased competition in our business, as a result of new entrants and existing insurers seeking to gain market share, resulting in decreased premium rates and less favorable contract terms and conditions. The adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims, which are influenced by many factors, including natural disasters, regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses. In addition, investment rates of return may impact rate adequacy and recently the Federal Reserve has indicated its intention to keep interest rates at historic lows through late 2014. These factors can have a significant impact on ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported. These factors could produce results that would


have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

We face significant competitive pressures in our businesses, which have reduced premium rates and could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume.

We compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business. We compete, and will continue to compete, with major U.S. and non-U.S. insurers and reinsurers, other regional companies, as well as mutual companies, specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies, some of which have implicit or explicit government support. Competitiveness in our businesses is based on many factors, including premium charges, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, commissions paid to producers, the perceived financial strength of the company, other terms and conditions offered, services provided (including ease of doing business over the internet), speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written.

Some of our competitors, particularly in the Reinsurance business, have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. These competitors within the reinsurance segment include Swiss Re, Munich Re, Berkshire Hathaway, Transatlantic Reinsurance, and Partner Re. We expect that perceived financial strength, in particular, will become more important as customers seek high quality reinsurers. Certain of our competitors operate from Bermuda or other tax advantaged or less regulated jurisdictions that may provide them with additional competitive and pricing advantages.

Over the past several years, we have faced increased competition in our business, particularly in our Reinsurance and Specialty segments, as increased supply has led to reduced prices and, at times, less favorable terms and conditions. Our Specialty segment has also encountered competition from admitted companies seeking to increase market share.  Although policy rates and terms for these lines of business generally stabilized or  showed modest improvements in 2011, we expect to continue to face strong competition in these and our other lines of business and as a result could experience renewed pressure on pricing and policy terms and conditions.

This intense competition could cause the supply and/or demand for insurance or reinsurance to change, which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us. If we are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on terms and conditions acceptable to us, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, which may require us to establish additional reserves.

Our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately $9.3 billion as of December 31, 2011. Our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred.

Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred, whether known or unknown. The major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency, inflation, judicial theories of liability, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and other factors, including the actions of third parties, which are beyond our control.

The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities, where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached. In periods with increased economic volatility, it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claim costs. It is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions. Reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed. Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain, we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events. Should we need to increase our reserves, our pre-tax income for the reporting period would decrease by a corresponding amount.


We discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers' compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid. Discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities. The expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss payout experience. Changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined. If the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated, the discount will be reduced and pre-tax income will decrease by a corresponding amount.

The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.

As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. Examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include, but are not limited to:

•

judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability;

•

plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers, including us, in purported class action litigation relating to claims-handling and other practices;

•

medical developments that link health issues to particular causes, resulting in liability claims;

•

claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies, including cyber security related risks;

and

•

claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions.

In some instances, these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known until many years after the policies are issued.

In addition, the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue, to remove limitations on recovery, to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business.

The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

As a property casualty insurer, we face losses from natural and man-made catastrophes.

Property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Catastrophe losses have had a significant impact on our results.  For example, weather-related losses were $153 million in 2011, $81 million in 2010, $63 million in 2009, $114 million in 2008, and $34 million in 2007.

Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, tsunamis, hailstorms, explosions, severe winter weather and fires, as well as terrorist activities. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable but have increased in recent years. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and other disasters may produce significant damage in large, heavily populated areas. Catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines, and most of our past catastrophe-related claims have resulted from severe storms. Seasonal weather variations or the impact of climate change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses. Insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred. It is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.


Conditions in the financial markets and the global economy have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if such conditions continue.

The significant volatility and uncertainty experienced in financial markets around the world during the past several years and the effect of the economic downturn have continued. Although the U.S. and various foreign governments have taken various actions to try to stabilize the financial markets, the ultimate effectiveness of such actions remains unclear. Therefore, volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and the resulting negative economic impact may continue for some time.

While we monitor conditions in the financial markets, we cannot predict future conditions or their impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Depending on conditions in the financial markets, we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio in future periods, and financial market volatility and uncertainty and an economic downturn could have a significant negative impact on third parties that we do business with, including insureds and reinsurers.

We, as a primary insurer, may have significant exposure for terrorist acts.

To the extent an act of terrorism, whether a domestic or foreign act, is certified by the Secretary of Treasury, we may be covered under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended (“TRIA”), for up to 85% of our losses for certain property/casualty lines of insurance. However, any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on 20% of earned premium for the prior year for the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance. Based on our 2011 earned premiums, our deductible under TRIA during 2012 is approximately $542 million. TRIA is in effect through December 31, 2014 unless extended or replaced by a similar program. The coverage provided under TRIA does not apply to reinsurance that we write.

Our earnings could be more volatile because of our significant level of retentions.

As compared to a number of our competitors, we maintain significant retention levels in premiums written. We purchase less reinsurance, the process by which we transfer, or cede, part of the risk we have assumed to a reinsurance company, thereby retaining more risk. As a result, our earnings could be more volatile and increased severities are more likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which increases our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business.

We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors. This system of regulation, generally administered in the United States by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business, relates to, among other things:

•

standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;

•

restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;

•

requirements pertaining to certain methods of accounting;

•

rate and form regulation pertaining to certain of our insurance businesses; and

•

potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies.

State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies, holding company issues and other matters. Our International business is also generally subject to a similar regulatory scheme in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct operations.

Federal financial services modernization legislation and legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be taken in response to the current conditions in the financial markets and the recent economic downturn may


lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years.

In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”), which is authorized to recommend that certain systemically significant non-bank financial companies, including insurance companies, be regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Dodd-Frank Act also established a Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) and authorized the federal preemption of certain state insurance laws. FSOC and the FIO are authorized to study, monitor and report to Congress on the U.S. insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the U.S. insurance market. The potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the U.S. insurance business is not clear.  Our business could be affected by changes, whether as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act or otherwise, to the U.S. system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant non-bank financial companies.

As a result of its direct majority ownership interest in Peyton Street Independent Financial Services Corporation, a thrift holding company, and indirect majority ownership stake in InsurBanc, a federal savings bank, W. R. Berkley Corporation is a “grandfathered savings and loan holding company” and, under the Dodd-Frank Act, is subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve.  As a grandfathered savings and loan holding company, W. R. Berkley Corporation may be subject to certain requirements and restrictions, including those related to its shareholders, management reporting, capital adequacy, dividends and distributions, transactions with affiliates and compensation plans.

Although U.S. state regulation is the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance, in addition to the changes brought about by the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress has considered over the past years various proposals relating to the creation of an optional federal charter, repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the McCarran Ferguson Act, and tax law changes. We may be subject to potentially increased federal oversight as a financial institution.

With respect to international measures, Solvency II, the EU directive concerning the capital adequacy, risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers which was adopted by the European Parliament in April 2009, may affect our insurance businesses. Implementation of Solvency II by EU member states, which is anticipated at the beginning of 2013, may require us to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance. In addition, Solvency II may have the effect of increasing the capital requirements of our EU domiciled insurers. Additionally, our capital requirements may be adversely affected if the EU Commission finds that the insurance regimes of our third-country domiciled companies are not “equivalent” to the requirements of Solvency II.

We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority's interpretation of the laws and regulations. Also, some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us. Also, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry, whether federal, state or foreign, or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities, may further restrict the conduct of our business.

Risks Relating to Our Business

We cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion, if at all, and, as a result, we could experience losses.

We purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed, known as ceding, to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us, the reinsured, of our liability to our policyholders. Our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers, and if our reinsurers fail to pay us, our financial results would be adversely affected. Underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims. As of December 31, 2011, the amount due from our reinsurers was approximately $1,216 million, including amounts due from state funds and industry pools where it was intended that we would bear no risk. Certain of these


amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds held in trust on our behalf.

We are subject to credit risk relating to our policyholders, independent agents and brokers.

In addition to exposure to credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverables and investment portfolio, we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business, including credit risk relating to policyholders, independent agents and brokers.  For example our policyholders, independent agents or brokers may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us or our brokers or other third party claim administrators may not deliver amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts for which we have provided funds.

As credit risk is generally a function of the economy, we face a greater credit risk in an economic downturn.  While we attempt to manage credit risks through underwriting guidelines, collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms, our efforts may not be successful.  For example, to reduce such credit risk, we require certain third parties to post collateral for some or all of their obligations to us.  In cases where we receive pledged securities and the applicable counterparty is unable to honor its obligations, we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged and/or the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed as a result of bankruptcy.  In cases where we receive letters of credit from banks as collateral and one of our counterparties is unable to honor its obligations, we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of credit.

We are rated by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's, and Moody's, and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease.

Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors. Our ratings are subject to periodic review, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current or any future ratings.

If our ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's or Moody's, our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our products. A significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claims-paying and financial strength ratings.

If market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable, we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.

As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries, especially catastrophe risks and those risks with relatively high policy limits. We also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to purchase, which may affect the level of our business and profitability. Our reinsurance contracts are generally subject to annual renewal, and we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. In addition, we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business that we intend to begin writing. If we are unable to renew our expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, especially catastrophe exposed risks.

Depending on conditions in the financial markets and the general economy, we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if needed.

If conditions in the financial markets and the general economy are unfavorable, we may be unable to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed, which could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our insurance company subsidiaries and/or to take advantage of opportunities to expand our business, such as possible acquisitions and the creation of new ventures, and inhibit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness if we desire to do so, on terms acceptable to us.


Our international operations expose us to investment, political and economic risks, including foreign currency and credit risk.

Our expanding international operations in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, South America, Australia, the Asia-Pacific region, Scandinavia and Canada expose us to increased investment, political and economic risks, including foreign currency and credit risk. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our investments in non-U.S.-denominated securities are subject to fluctuations in non-U.S. securities and currency markets, and those markets can be volatile. Non-U.S. currency fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our non-U.S. subsidiaries to their parent companies in the U.S.

We may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do, we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures.

As part of our present strategy, we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the start-up of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis, and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or insurance ventures, that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or start-up ventures will be successful. The process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and qualified employees.

We depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including our Chairman and CEO, President and  COO, senior executive officers, presidents of our operating units, experienced underwriters and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business. If the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases, we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate, and be unable to expand our operations into new markets.

If we experience difficulties with our information technology, telecommunications or other computer systems, our ability to conduct our business could be negatively impacted.

Our business is highly dependent upon our employees' ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion.  A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other computer systems could significantly impair our employees' ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, terrorist attack or industrial accident, or the infection of our systems by a malicious computer virus, our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time. In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. If our business continuity plans do not sufficiently address such a business interruption, system failure or service denial, our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions could be significantly impaired and our business could be harmed.

Failure to maintain the security of our networks and confidential data may expose us to liability

.

Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Computer viruses, hackers, employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches. In addition, we routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means.  Our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security. While we attempt to develop secure data transmission capabilities with these third-party vendors and others with whom we do business, we may be unable to put in place such secure capabilities with all of such vendors and third parties and, in addition, these third parties may not have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the sensitive information being transferred.  Our failure to protect sensitive personal and our proprietary information, whether owing to breaches of our own systems or those of our vendors, could result in significant monetary and reputational damages.  These increased risks, and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data


security, could expose us to data loss, monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs.  As a result, our ability to conduct our business could be materially and adversely affected.

We could be adversely affected if our controls to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective.

Our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting, claim processing and investment activities, many of which are highly complex. These activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies, as well as legal and regulatory standards, including those related to privacy, anti-corruption, anti-bribery and global finance and insurance matters. Our continued expansion into new international markets has brought about additional requirements.  A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. If our controls are not effective, it could lead to financial loss, unanticipated risk exposure (including underwriting, credit and investment risk) or damage to our reputation.

Risks Relating to Our Investments

A significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity securities and is subject to market fluctuations.

Our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed maturity securities. As of December 31, 2011, our investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately $11 billion, or 84% of our total investment portfolio. As of that date, our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consisted of the following types of securities: U.S. Government securities (9%); state and municipal securities (48%); corporate securities (21%); mortgage-backed securities (14%) and foreign government and corporate bonds (8%).

The fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair value of fixed maturity securities generally decreases as interest rates rise. Conversely, if interest rates decline, investment income earned from future investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower. Some fixed maturity securities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, also carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations.  Additionally, given the historically low interest rate environment, we may not be able to successfully reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities at yields commensurate with our target performance goals.

The value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer, default by the issuer (including states and municipalities) in the performance of its obligations in respect of the securities and/or increases in market interest rates. To a large degree, the credit risk we face is a function of the economy; accordingly, we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession. Although the historical rates of default on state and municipal securities have been relatively low, our state and municipal fixed maturity securities could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue. The economic downturn has resulted in many states and municipalities operating under deficits or projected deficits, the severity and duration of which could have an adverse impact on both the valuation of our state and municipal fixed maturity securities and the issuer's ability to perform its obligations thereunder. Additionally, our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest, as well as risks inherent in particular securities.

Although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal, our efforts may not be successful. Impairments, defaults and/or rate increases could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses. Investment returns are currently, and will likely continue to remain, under pressure due to the significant volatility experienced in the financial markets, economic uncertainty, more generally, and the shape of the yield curve. As a result, our exposure to the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

We invest some of our assets in equity securities, merger arbitrage securities, investment funds, private equity and real estate related assets, which may decline in value.

We invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities, merger arbitrage securities, investment funds, private equity and real estate related assets and have recently increased our investments in these asset classes


as a result of the current historically low interest rate environment. At December 31, 2011, our investment in these assets was approximately $2 billion, or 16%, of our investment portfolio. We reported provisions for other than temporary impairments in the value of these assets of approximately $400,000 in 2011, $9 million in 2010 and $63 million in 2009, and losses from investment funds of $6 million in 2010, and $164 million in 2009.

Merger and arbitrage trading securities were $397 million, or 3%, of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2011. Merger arbitrage involves investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers. Merger arbitrage differs from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period, usually four months or less. Our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals, which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks.

Investments in real estate investment funds and limited partnerships and loans receivable were $921 million, or 6%, of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2011. The values of our real estate related investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy and interest rates in general and real estate valuations in particular. These investments have been subject to significant volatility as a result of the current conditions in the financial markets. In addition, our investments in real estate related assets are less liquid than our other investments.

Risks Relating to Purchasing Our Securities

We are an insurance holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts.

As an insurance holding company, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries. We have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, paying dividends to stockholders and repurchasing our shares and paying corporate expenses. The payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries, as well as regulatory restrictions. During 2012, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately $417 million. As a result, in the future we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations, pay dividends or repurchase shares.

Laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could delay, deter or prevent an attempt to acquire control of us that stockholders might consider to be desirable, and may restrict a stockholder's ability to purchase our common stock.

Generally, United States insurance holding

company laws require that, before a person can acquire control of an insurance company, prior written approval

must be obtained from the insurance regulatory authorities in the state in which that insurance company is

domiciled. Pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, “control” over an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person,

directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 10% or more of

the voting securities of that insurer (5% for Alabama domiciled insurers, such as us due to our ownership of American Mining). Indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of our common stock. Thus,

the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which our insurance operating units are domiciled are likely to

apply these restrictions on acquisition of control to any proposed acquisition of our common

stock. Some states require a person seeking to acquire control of an insurer licensed but not domiciled in that state to

make a filing prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the target

insurer and its affiliates, on the other hand, have specified market shares in the same lines of insurance in that state.  Additionally, many foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business impose similar restrictions and requirements.

While these provisions may not require acquisition approval, they can lead to the imposition of conditions on an

acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation.

These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change in control

of us through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might

consider to be desirable.

Certain provisions in our organizational documents may have the effect of hindering, delaying or preventing third party takeovers and thus may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for their shares in an unsolicited takeover or make it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management.

Provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, as well as state insurance statutes, may


hinder, delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control. These provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of directors.

These provisions include:

•

our classified board of directors and the ability of our board to increase its size and to appoint directors to fill newly created directorships;

•

the requirement that 80% of our stockholders must approve mergers and other transactions between us and the holder of 5% or more of our shares, unless the transaction was approved by our board of directors prior to such holder's acquisition of 5% of our shares; and

•

the need for advance notice in order to raise business or make nominations at stockholders' meetings.

These provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of us through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA


ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

W. R. Berkley Corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the United States and operates in five business segments: Specialty, Regional, Alternative Markets, Reinsurance and International. Our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches. It also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics. While providing our business units with certain operating autonomy, our structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital, investment and reinsurance management, and actuarial, financial and corporate legal staff support. The Company’s primary sources of revenues and earnings are its insurance operations and its investments.

An important part of our strategy is to form new operating units to capitalize on various business opportunities, with 21 of our 45 units formed since 2006. These newer units are focused on important parts of the economy in the U.S., including healthcare, energy and agriculture, and on growing international markets, including Norway, Australia, the Asia-Pacific region and South America.  As a result, our international operations have become an increasingly important part of our business.

The profitability of the Company’s insurance business is affected primarily by the adequacy of premium rates. The ultimate adequacy of premium rates is not known with certainty at the time a property casualty insurance policy is issued because premiums are determined before claims are reported. The ultimate adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of claims, which are influenced by many factors, including natural and other disasters, regulatory measures and court decisions that define and change the extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of compensation for injuries or losses. General insurance prices are also influenced by available insurance capacity, i.e., the level of policyholders’ surplus employed in the industry, and the industry’s willingness to deploy that capital.

Beginning in 2005, the property casualty insurance market became more competitive and insurance rates decreased across most business lines. Increased competition and the impact of the economic downturn also put pressure on policy terms and conditions. While prices began to increase in 2011, loss costs are also increasing and current market price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the Company to achieve its return objectives. Recently, there have been increased signs of a hardening market, and, with its investments in new businesses, the Company believes it is well-positioned to take advantage of new opportunities.  Price changes are reflected in the Company’s results over time as premiums are earned.

The Company’s profitability is also affected by its investment income. The Company’s invested assets, which are derived from its own capital and cash flow from its insurance business, are invested principally in fixed maturity securities. The return on fixed maturity securities is affected primarily by general interest rates, which are at historically low levels, as well as the credit quality and duration of the securities. The Company also invests in equity securities, merger arbitrage, private equity investments, investment funds and real estate.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The following presents a discussion of accounting policies and estimates relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses, assumed premiums and other-than-temporary impairments of investments. Management believes these policies and estimates are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.

Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses

.

To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, either known or unknown, insurers establish reserves, which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred. Estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments, often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements. Such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the report of the loss to the insurer, the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss.

In general, when a claim is reported, claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time. The estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim. Reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) to the insurer, potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims,


including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process. Reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided.

In examining reserve adequacy, several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses. These factors include, among other things, historical data, legal developments, changes in social attitudes and economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. The actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. Reserve amounts are based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data. As additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, these estimates and judgments may be revised. This may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed.

The risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves have increased under the current financial market conditions. It is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions. Whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation, increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation. A change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our operations in periods in which such assumptions are changed.

Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost. While the methods for establishing reserves are well tested over time, some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors, including the actions of third parties which are beyond the Company’s control. These variables are affected by external and internal events, such as inflation and economic volatility, judicial and litigation trends, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices, which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs. The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain, the Company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.

Loss reserves included in the Company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates based upon an actuarially derived point estimate and other considerations. The Company uses a variety of actuarial techniques and methods to derive an actuarial point estimate for each operating unit. These methods include paid loss development, incurred loss development, paid and incurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods and frequency and severity methods. In circumstances where one actuarial method is considered more credible than the others, that method is used to set the point estimate. For example, the paid loss and incurred loss development methods rely on historical paid and incurred loss data. For new lines of business, where there is insufficient history of paid and incurred claims data, or in circumstances where there have been significant changes in claim practices, the paid and incurred loss development methods would be less credible than other actuarial methods. The actuarial point estimate may also be based on a judgmental weighting of estimates produced from each of the methods considered. Industry loss experience is used to supplement the Company’s own data in selecting “tail factors” and in areas where the Company’s own data is limited. The actuarial data is analyzed by line of business, coverage and accident or policy year, as appropriate, for each operating unit.

The establishment of the actuarially derived loss reserve point estimate also includes consideration of qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate losses. These qualitative considerations include, among others, the impact of re-underwriting initiatives, changes in the mix of business, changes in distribution sources and changes in policy terms and conditions. Examples of changes in terms and conditions that can have a significant impact on reserve levels are the use of aggregate policy limits, the expansion of coverage exclusions, whether or not defense costs are within policy limits, and changes in deductibles and attachment points.

The key assumptions used to arrive at the best estimate of loss reserves are the expected loss ratios, rate of loss cost inflation, and reported and paid loss emergence patterns. Expected loss ratios represent management’s expectation of losses at the time the business is written, before any actual claims experience has emerged. This expectation is a significant determinant of the estimate of loss reserves for recently written business where there is little paid or incurred loss data to consider. Expected loss ratios are generally derived from historical loss ratios adjusted for the impact of rate changes, loss cost trends and known changes in the type of risks underwritten. Expected loss ratios are estimated for each key line of business within each operating unit. Expected loss cost inflation is particularly important for the long-tail lines, such as excess casualty, and claims with a high medical component, such as workers’ compensation. Reported and paid loss emergence patterns are used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value. Loss development factors are based on the historical emergence patterns of paid and incurred losses, and are derived from the Company’s own experience and industry data. The paid loss emergence pattern is also significant to excess and assumed workers’ compensation reserves because those reserves are discounted to their estimated present value based upon such estimated payout patterns. Management believes the estimates


and assumptions it makes in the reserving process provide the best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred; however, different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates.

Loss frequency and severity are measures of loss activity that are considered in determining the key assumptions described in our discussion of loss and loss expense reserves, including expected loss ratios, rate of loss cost inflation and reported and paid loss emergence patterns. Loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure, and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims. Factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns. Factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits, retentions, rate of inflation and judicial interpretations.

Another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag, which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the Company. The length of the loss reporting lag affects our ability to accurately predict loss frequency (loss frequencies are more predictable for lines with short reporting lags) as well as the amount of reserves needed for incurred but not reported losses (less IBNR is required for lines with short reporting lags). As a result, loss reserves for lines with short reporting lags are likely to have less variation from initial loss estimates. For lines with short reporting lags, which include commercial automobile, primary workers’ compensation, other liability (claims-made) and property business, the key assumption is the loss emergence pattern used to project ultimate loss estimates from known losses paid or reported to date. For lines of business with long reporting lags, which include other liability (occurrence), products liability, excess workers’ compensation and liability reinsurance, the key assumption is the expected loss ratio since there is often little paid or incurred loss data to consider. Historically, the Company has experienced less variation from its initial loss estimates for lines of businesses with short reporting lags than for lines of business with long reporting lags.

The key assumptions used in calculating the most recent estimate of the loss reserves are reviewed each quarter and adjusted, to the extent necessary, to reflect historical changes, current trends and other factors observed. If the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected, the ultimate losses will be different than management’s estimate. The following table reflects the impact of changes (which could be favorable or unfavorable) in frequency and severity, relative to our assumptions, on our loss estimate for claims occurring in 2011 (dollars in thousands):

Our net reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately $8.2 billion as of

December 31, 2011

relate to multiple accident years. Therefore, the impact of changes in frequency or severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above.

Approximately $1.4 billion, or 19%, of the Company’s net loss reserves as of

December 31, 2011

relate to assumed reinsurance business. There is a higher degree of uncertainty and greater variability regarding estimates of assumed loss reserves because those estimates are based, in part, upon information received from ceding companies. If information received from ceding companies is not timely or correct, the Company’s estimate of ultimate losses may not be accurate. Furthermore, due to delayed reporting of claim information by ceding companies, the claim settlement tail for assumed reinsurance is extended. Management considers the impact of delayed reporting in its selection of assumed loss development factors.

Information received from ceding companies is used to set initial expected loss ratios, to establish case reserves and to estimate reserves for incurred but not reported losses on assumed reinsurance business. This information, which is generally provided through reinsurance intermediaries, is gathered through the underwriting process and from periodic claim reports and other correspondence with ceding companies. The Company performs underwriting and claim audits of selected ceding companies to determine the accuracy and completeness of information provided to the Company. The information received from the ceding companies is supplemented by the Company’s own loss development experience with similar lines of business as well as industry loss trends and loss development benchmarks.

The following table presents development in our estimate of claims occurring in prior years:

_____________

(1) Represents portion of reserve development offset by additional or return premiums on retrospectively rated insurance policies and reinsurance agreements.

For the year ended

December 31, 2011

, estimates for claims occurring in prior years decreased by $182 million. The favorable reserve development in 2011 was primarily attributable to accident years 2007 through 2009. The changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends. Original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends.

Specialty

- The majority of the favorable reserve development for the specialty segment during 2011 and 2010 was associated with excess and surplus (“E&S”) casualty business. E&S insurers are free from rate and form regulation and generally charge higher rates for business than those that are charged in the “standard” market. Beginning in 2002, the E&S business began to experience improved claim frequency (i.e., a lower number of reported claims per unit of exposure). One reason for the lower number of claims was the Company’s introduction of more restrictive policy language which included additional exclusions that eliminated claims that would have previously been covered, particularly for the Company’s building contractor business. In addition, as standard carriers tightened their underwriting criteria, the Company benefited from an influx of accounts from the standard market to the E&S market during these years. The more restrictive policy language and the influx of standard market business resulted in an improved risk profile within the E&S business and a reduction in loss costs that was not expected at the time loss reserves were initially established. In addition, loss severity trends for E&S casualty business have been lower than we had initially expected for the 2005 to 2009 period.  We began to recognize these trends in 2007 and have continued to reduce our estimates of ultimate claim costs since then as the magnitude of the frequency trends has become more evident. The favorable reserve development in 2011 was primarily attributable to accident years 2007 through 2009.

Regional

- The favorable reserve development for the regional segment during 2011 was primarily related to the general liability portion of commercial multi-peril business and to commercial automobile liability business. The favorable reserve development resulted mainly from lower loss emergence on known case reserves relative to historical levels. The favorable reserve development was primarily attributable to accident years 2007 through 2009.

Alternative Markets

- The favorable reserve development for the alternative markets segment during 2011 was related to a decrease in prior year reserves for primary workers’ compensation business and, to a lesser extent, for medical excess business, partially offset by an increase in prior year reserves for excess workers’ compensation business. The majority of favorable reserve development for primary workers’ compensation was related to California business, where the impact of legislative reforms continues to be reflected in improved loss trends.  The increase in loss reserves for excess workers’ compensation business was related primarily to increased medical and pharmaceutical costs associated with certain long-term disability claims.

Reinsurance

- The favorable development for the reinsurance segment during 2011 was related to umbrella and professional liability treaty business, facultative business and to business written through Lloyd’s of London. The favorable development for the segment was spread across underwriting years 2005 through 2010 and resulted from lower than expected reported losses.


International

- The favorable reserve development for the international segment during 2011 was primarily related to property business written in 2010 by our Lloyd's syndicate and Asia-Pacific reinsurance business.

Loss Reserve Discount

- The Company discounts its liabilities for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid. Discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities. The expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the Company’s loss payout experience. For non-proportional business, reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using risk-free discount rates determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. For proportional business, reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware of 2.3%. As of

December 31, 2011

, the aggregate blended discount rates ranged from 2.3% to 6.5%, with a weighted average discount rate of 4.3%. The aggregate net discount, after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance, was $892 million and $898 million as of

December 31, 2011

and

December 31, 2010

, respectively.

Assumed Reinsurance Premiums

. The Company estimates the amount of assumed reinsurance premiums that it will receive under treaty reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contracts. These premium estimates are revised as the actual amount of assumed premiums is reported to the Company by the ceding companies. As estimates of assumed premiums are made or revised, the related amount of earned premiums, commissions and incurred losses associated with those premiums are recorded. Estimated assumed premiums receivable were approximately $64 million and $58 million at

December 31, 2011

and

December 31, 2010

, respectively. The assumed premium estimates are based upon terms set forth in reinsurance agreements, information received from ceding companies during the underwriting and negotiation of agreements, reports received from ceding companies and discussions and correspondence with reinsurance intermediaries. The Company also considers its own view of market conditions, economic trends and experience with similar lines of business. These premium estimates represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate amount of premiums to be received under its assumed reinsurance agreements.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments (OTTI) of Investments

. The cost of securities is adjusted where appropriate to include a provision for decline in value which is considered to be other-than-temporary. An other-than-temporary decline is considered to occur in investments where there has been a sustained reduction in fair value and where the Company does not expect the fair value to recover prior to the time of sale or maturity. Since equity securities do not have a contractual cash flow or maturity, the Company considers whether the price of an equity security is expected to recover within a reasonable period of time.

The Company classifies its fixed maturity securities and preferred stocks by credit rating, primarily based on ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. For purposes of classifying securities with different ratings, the Company uses the lower rating if two ratings were assigned and the middle rating if three ratings were assigned, unless the Company’s own analysis indicates that the lower rating is more appropriate. Securities that are not rated by a rating agency are evaluated and classified by the Company on a case-by-case basis.

Fixed Maturity Securities

– For securities that we intend to sell or, more likely than not, would be required to sell, a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be OTTI. The amount of OTTI is equal to the difference between amortized cost and fair value at the balance sheet date. For securities that we do not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell, a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be an OTTI if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security (i.e., the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security).

The portion of the decline in value considered to be a credit loss (i.e., the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security) is recognized in earnings. The portion of the decline in value not considered to be a credit loss (i.e., the difference in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the fair value of the security) is recognized in other comprehensive income.

Impairment assessments for structured securities, including mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations and corporate debt, are generally evaluated based on the performance of the underlying collateral under various economic and default scenarios that may involve subjective judgments and estimates by management. Modeling these securities involves various factors, such as projected default rates, the nature and realizable value of the collateral, if any, the ability of the issuer to make scheduled payments, historical performance and other relevant economic and performance factors. If an OTTI determination is made, a discounted cash flow analysis is used to ascertain the amount of the credit impairment.


The following table provides a summary of all fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position as of

December 31, 2011

:

A summary of the Company’s non-investment grade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position at

December 31, 2011

is presented in the table below.

_______________

(1)  This investment is a residential mortgage-backed security that was evaluated based on the performance of the underlying collateral under various economic and default scenarios.  The security has met its contractual obligations and the Company expects that it will continue to meet those contractual payment obligations as they become due.  Based on this evaluation, the Company does not consider the investment to be OTTI.

The Company has evaluated its fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and believes the unrealized losses are due primarily to temporary market and sector-related factors rather than to issuer-specific factors. None of these securities are delinquent or in default under financial covenants. Based on its assessment of these issuers, the Company expects them to continue to meet their contractual payment obligations as they become due and does not consider any of these securities to be OTTI.

Preferred Stocks

– At

December 31, 2011

, there were

six

preferred stocks in an unrealized loss position, with an aggregate fair value of

$69 million

and a gross unrealized loss of

$15 million

.   Four of the six securities are investment-grade.  None of these securities are delinquent or in default.  Management believes the unrealized losses are due primarily to market and sector related factors and does not consider these to be OTTI.

Two

of those preferred stocks with an aggregate fair value of

$9 million

and a gross unrealized loss of

$5 million

are rated non-investment grade. One of these two securities representing most of the gross unrealized loss has recently reflected improved fundamentals.  The Company does not consider this security to be OTTI.

Common Stocks

– At

December 31, 2011

, the Company owned

four

common stocks in an unrealized loss position with an aggregate fair value of

$47 million

and an aggregate unrealized loss of

$3 million

. The Company does not consider these common stocks to be OTTI.

Loans Receivable

– The Company monitors the performance of its loans receivable, including current market conditions for each loan and the ability to collect principal and interest. For loans where the Company determines it is probable that the contractual terms will not be met, an analysis is performed and a valuation reserve is established, if necessary, with a charge to earnings. Loans receivable are reported net of a valuation reserve of

$20 million

at December 31,  2011 and 2010.

The Company monitors the performance of its loans receivable and assesses the ability of the borrower to pay principal and interest based upon loan structure, underlying property values, cash flow and related financial and operating performance of the property and market conditions. Loans receivable with a potential for default are further assessed using discounted cash


flow analysis and comparable cost and sales methodologies, if appropriate.

Fair Value Measurements

.

The Company’s fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale and its trading account securities are carried at fair value. Fair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available. The fair value of the vast majority of the Company’s portfolio is based on observable data (other than quoted prices) and, accordingly, is classified as Level 2.

In classifying particular financial securities in the fair value hierarchy, the Company uses its judgment to determine whether the market for a security is active and whether significant pricing inputs are observable. The Company determines the existence of an active market by assessing whether transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide reliable pricing information. The Company determines whether inputs are observable based on the use of such information by pricing services and external investment managers, the uninterrupted availability of such inputs, the need to make significant adjustments to such inputs and the volatility of such inputs over time. If the market for a security is determined to be inactive or if significant inputs used to price a security are determined to be unobservable, the security is categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis, the Company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data. Quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions. For publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable, the Company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data. For securities traded only in private negotiations, the Company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities, which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer, financial data, projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information.

The following is a summary of pricing sources for the Company's fixed maturity securities available for sale as of

December 31, 2011

:

Independent pricing services

- The vast majority of the Company’s fixed maturity securities available for sale were priced by independent pricing services (generally one U.S. pricing service plus additional pricing services with respect to a limited number of foreign securities held by the Company). The prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets (e.g., broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities). The determination of whether markets are active or inactive is based upon the volume and level of activity for a particular asset class. The Company reviews the prices provided by pricing services for reasonableness based upon current trading levels for similar securities. If the prices appear unusual to the Company, they are re-examined and the value is either confirmed or revised. In addition, the Company periodically performs independent price tests of a sample of securities to ensure proper valuation and to verify our understanding of how securities are priced. As of

December 31, 2011

, the Company did not make any adjustments to the prices provided by the pricing services. Based upon the Company’s review of the methodologies used by the independent pricing services, these securities were classified as Level 2.

Syndicate manager

– The Company has a 15% participation in a Lloyd’s syndicate, and the Company’s share of the securities owned by the syndicate is priced by the syndicate’s manager. The majority of the securities are liquid, short duration


fixed maturity securities. The Company reviews the syndicate manager’s pricing methodology and audited financial statements and holds discussions with the syndicate manager as necessary to confirm its understanding and agreement with security prices. Based upon the Company’s review of the methodologies used by the syndicate manager, these securities were classified as Level 2.

Observable data

– If independent pricing is not available, the Company prices the securities directly. Prices are based on observable market data where available, including current trading levels for similar securities and non-binding quotations from brokers. The Company generally requests two or more quotes. If more than one quote is received, the Company sets a price within the range of quotes received based on its assessment of the credibility of the quote and its own evaluation of the security. The Company generally does not adjust quotes obtained from brokers. Since these securities were priced based on observable data, they were classified as Level 2.

Cash flow model

– If the above methodologies are not available, the Company prices securities using a discounted cash flow model based upon assumptions as to prevailing credit spreads, interest rates and interest rate volatility, time to maturity and subordination levels. Discount rates are adjusted to reflect illiquidity where appropriate. These securities were classified as Level 3.


Results of Operations for the Years Ended

December 31, 2011

and


Business Segment Results

Following is a summary of gross and net premiums written, premiums earned, loss ratios (losses and loss expenses incurred expressed as a percentage of premiums earned), expense ratios (underwriting expenses expressed as a percentage of premiums earned) and GAAP combined ratios (sum of loss ratio and expense ratio) for each of our business segments for the years ended

December 31, 2011

and 2010. The GAAP combined ratio represents a measure of underwriting profitability, excluding investment income. A GAAP combined ratio in excess of 100 indicates an underwriting loss; a number below 100 indicates an underwriting profit.


Net Income to Common Stockholders

. The following table presents the Company’s net income to common stockholders and net income per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (amounts in thousands, except per share data):

The Company reported net income of $395 million in 2011 compared to $449 million in 2010. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a decline in underwriting income partially offset by an increase in net investment gains.  The decline in underwriting income was attributable to an increase in catastrophe losses of $72 million and a decrease in favorable prior year reserve development of $52 million.  The number of weighted average diluted shares decreased as a result of the Company’s repurchases of its common stock in 2011 and 2010.

Premiums

. Gross premiums written were $5,077 million in 2011, an increase of 15% from $4,416 million in 2010. The increase in gross premiums written was primarily due to growth in our specialty and international business segments as a result of expansion into new geographic and product markets. Approximately 80% of policies expiring in 2011 were renewed, compared with a 77% renewal retention rate for policies expiring in 2010. The average rate (i.e., average premium adjusted for change in exposures) for policies that renewed in 2011 increased by approximately 2.3%.  Audit premiums were $53 million in 2011 compared with $18 million in 2010.

Beginning in 2005, the property casualty insurance market became more competitive and insurance rates decreased across most business lines. While prices increased in 2011, overall loss costs are also generally increasing and current market price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the Company to achieve its return objectives. A summary of gross premiums written in 2011 compared with 2010 by line of business within each business segment follows:

•

Specialty premiums increased 19% to $1,818 million in 2011 from $1,526 million in 2010 primarily due to increased business in the energy and environmental markets. Gross premiums increased $121 million (27%) for other liability,$65 million (21%) for property lines, $38 million (30%) for commercial automobile, $22 million (11%) for professional liability, $10 million (11%) for products liability and $36 million (13%) for other lines.

•

Regional gross premiums decreased 1% to $1,149 million in 2011 from $1,160 million in 2010. Gross premiums increased $14 million (3%) for commercial multiple peril, $11 million (5%) for workers’ compensation and $7 million (4%) for other lines.  Gross premiums decreased $7 million (2%) for commercial automobile.  Gross premiums written decreased $36 million as a result of the transfer of fully reinsured assigned risk plan premiums to the alternative markets segment in 2011.

•

Alternative Markets gross premiums increased 18% to $827 million in 2011 from $703 million in 2010.  Excluding assigned risk plans, which are fully reinsured, gross premiums increased 6% to $676 million in 2011 from $636 million in 2010.   Gross premiums increased $51 million (68%) for accident and health products, $29 million (11%) for primary workers’ compensation and $13 million (38%) for other liability and decreased $4 million (7%) for other lines.  Gross premiums decreased $48 million (24%) for excess workers’ compensation.  Fully reinsured assigned risk premiums increased $84 million (including the $36 million transferred from the regional segment) to $151 million in 2011.

•

Reinsurance gross premiums increased 7% to $453 million in 2011 from $425 million in 2010. Gross premiums  increased 9% to $314 million for casualty business and 1% to $139 million for property business.

•

International gross premiums increased 38% to $829 million in 2011 from $602 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in business written by our Lloyd’s operation, our companies in Australia, and new insurance branches in Germany and Norway. Gross premiums increased $93 million (64%) for property lines, $53 million (56%) for assumed reinsurance, $27 million (58%) for liability lines, $19 million (18%) for professional liability, $16 million (27%) for workers’ compensation and $6 million (8%) for automobile.  In addition, one percentage point of the 38% increase in gross premiums written resulted from changes in foreign exchange rates.

Net premiums written were $4,357 million in 2011, an increase of 13% from $3,851 million in 2010. Ceded reinsurance premiums as a percentage of gross written premiums increased to 14% in 2011 from 13% in 2010. The increase in the percentage of business ceded was due to the increase in premiums written by new companies, which cede a higher portion of their gross premiums, and to growth in premiums written by assigned risk plans, which cede 100% of their gross premiums.


Premiums earned increased 9% to $4,161 million in 2011 from $3,836 million in 2010. Insurance premiums (including the impact of rate changes) are generally earned evenly over the policy term.  Premiums earned in 2011 are related to business written during both 2011 and 2010.

Net Investment Income

. Following is a summary of net investment income for 2011 and 2010:

Net investment income decreased 1% to $526 million in 2011 from $531 million in 2010. The decrease in investment income was due to a decrease in income from arbitrage trading activities, partially offset by income from investment funds (which are reported on a one quarter lag).  Average invested assets, at cost (including cash and cash equivalents) were $13.6 billion in 2011 and $13.4 billion in 2010.

Insurance Service Fees

. The Company is a servicing carrier of worker's compensation assigned risk plans for 20 states and provides insurance program management services to self-insureds, captives, governmental entities, risk retention groups, and insurance companies.  Service fees were $93 million in 2011, up from $85 million in 2010, primarily as a result of an increase in fees from assigned risk plans.

Net Investment Gains

. The Company buys and sells securities on a regular basis in order to maximize its total return on investments. Decisions to sell securities are based on management’s view of the underlying fundamentals of specific securities as well as management’s expectations regarding interest rates, credit spreads, currency values and general economic conditions. Net realized gains on investment sales were $126 million in 2011 compared with $66 million in 2010.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments.

The cost of securities is adjusted where appropriate to include a provision for decline in value which is considered to be other-than-temporary.  Other-than-temporary impairments were $0.4 million in 2011 compared with $9.2 million in 2010.

Revenues from Wholly-Owned Investees

.  These revenues were derived from aviation-related businesses that provide services to the general aviation market, including fuel and line service, aircraft sales and maintenance, avionics and engineering services and parts fabrication.  Revenues from wholly-owned investees increased to $249 million in 2011 from $214 million in 2010, primarily as a result of higher aircraft sales.

Losses and Loss Expenses

. Losses and loss expenses increased to $2,658 million in 2011 from $2,310 million in 2010. The consolidated loss ratio of 63.9% in 2011 was 3.7 points higher than the loss ratio of 60.2% in 2010.   Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement premiums, were $153 million in 2011 compared with $81 million in 2010, an increase of  1.6 loss ratio points.  Catastrophe losses in 2011 included losses from severe wind and hail storms in the United States, an earthquake in Japan and floods in Thailand.  Favorable prior year reserve development was $182 million in 2011 compared with $234 million in 2010, a difference of 1.7 loss ratio points.  The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development increased 0.4 points to 64.6% in 2011 from 64.2% in 2010.  A summary of loss ratios in 2011 compared with 2010 by business segment follows:

•

Specialty - The loss ratio of 59.4% in 2011 was 1.1 points higher than the loss ratio of 58.3% in 2010.  Catastrophe losses were $17 million, or 1.2 loss ratio points, in 2011 compared with none in 2010.  Favorable prior year reserve development was $102 million in 2011 compared with $99 million in 2010, a difference of 0.6 loss ratio points.  The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development decreased 0.7 points to 65.3% in 2011 from 66.0% in 2010.

•

Regional - The loss ratio of 68.0% in 2011 was 7.3 points higher than the loss ratio of 60.7% in 2010.    Catastrophe


losses were $85 million in 2011 compared with $73 million in 2010, an increase of 1.1 loss ratio points.  Favorable prior year reserve development was $40 million in 2011 compared with $84 million in 2010, a difference of 4.1 loss ratio points. The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development increased  2.1 points to 63.8% in 2011 from 61.7% in 2010 due to earned pricing and loss cost trends.

•

Alternative Markets - The loss ratio of 72.3% in 2011 was 4.7 points higher than the loss ratio of 67.6% in 2010.    Catastrophe losses were $2 million in 2011 compared with none in 2010, an increase of 0.3 loss ratio points.  Favorable prior year reserve development was $3 million in 2011 compared with $24 million in 2010, a difference of  3.4 loss ratio points. The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development increased 1.0 points to 72.5% in 2011 from 71.5% in 2010.

•

Reinsurance - The loss ratio of 61.6% in 2011 was 9.1 points higher than the loss ratio of 52.5% in 2010.   Catastrophe losses were $24 million in 2011 compared $4 million in 2010, an increase of  4.7 loss ratio points. Favorable prior year reserve development was $25 million in 2011 compared with $26 million in 2010, a difference of 0.5 loss ratio points.  The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development increased 3.9 points to 61.7% in 2011 from 57.8% in 2010 due to higher non-catastrophe property losses.

•

International - The loss ratio of 60.5% in 2011 was 1.3 points lower than the loss ratio of 61.8% in 2010. Catastrophe losses were $25 million in 2011 compared with $4 million in 2010, an increase of 3.2 loss ratio points.  Favorable prior year reserve development was $12 million in 2011 and $1 million in 2010, a difference of 1.7 loss ratio points.  The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development decreased 2.8 points to 58.4% in 2011 from 61.2% in 2010 due to improved profitability for our businesses in South America and Australia.

Other Operating Costs and Expenses

. Following is a summary of other operating costs and expenses for 2011 and 2010:

Underwriting expenses are comprised of commissions paid to agents and brokers, premium taxes and other assessments and internal underwriting costs. The expense ratio (underwriting expenses expressed as a percentage of premiums earned) was 34.4% in 2011 compared with 34.3% in 2010 due to increases in internal underwriting costs, largely offset by an increase in earned premiums.

Service expenses, which represent the costs associated with the fee-based businesses, increased 4% to $75 million. The increase was due to an increase in general and administrative expenses.

Net foreign currency gains and losses result from transactions denominated in a currency other than the operating unit’s functional currency.

Other costs and expenses, which represent general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to business segments, increased to $115 million in 2011 from $107 million in 2010 due to an increase in general and administrative expenses.

Expenses from Wholly-Owned Investees

.  These expenses represent costs associated with aviation-related businesses that include cost of goods sold related to aircraft and other sales, labor and equipment costs related to repairs and other services and general and administrative expenses.  Expenses from wholly-owned investees were $245 million in 2011 compared to $208 million in 2010 due to higher cost of aircraft sold as a result of higher sales volume.

Interest Expense

. Interest expense was $113 million in 2011 compared with $107 million in 2010 due to the issuance of $300 million of 5.375% senior notes in September 2010, partially offset by repayment of $150 million 5.125% senior notes in September 2010.

Income Taxes

. The effective income tax rate was 24% in 2011 as compared to 25% in 2010. The effective income tax rate differs from the federal income tax rate of 35% primarily because of tax-exempt investment income and utilization of foreign tax credits, including a reduction of the valuation allowance. Tax exempt investment income comprised a higher portion of the 2011 pre-tax income and as such had a higher impact on the effective tax rate for 2011 compared with 2010.


Results of Operations for the Years Ended

December 31, 2010

and 2009

Business Segment Results

Following is a summary of gross and net premiums written, premiums earned, loss ratios (losses and loss expenses incurred expressed as a percentage of premiums earned), expense ratios (underwriting expenses expressed as a percentage of premiums earned) and GAAP combined ratios (sum of loss ratio and expense ratio) for each of our business segments for the years ended

December 31, 2010

and 2009. The GAAP combined ratio represents a measure of underwriting profitability, excluding investment income. A GAAP combined ratio in excess of 100 indicates an underwriting loss; a number below 100 indicates an underwriting profit.


Net Income to Common Stockholders

.  The following table presents the Company's net income to common stockholders and net income per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (amounts in thousands, except per share data):

The Company reported net income of $449 million in 2010 compared to $309 million in 2009.  The increase in net income was primarily due to lower losses from investment funds ($6 million in 2010 compared with $164 million in 2009) and lower other-than-temporary investment impairments ($9 million in 2010 compared with $152 million in 2009).  The number of weighted average diluted shares decreased as a result of the Company's repurchases of its common stock in 2010 and 2009.

Premiums

.

Gross premiums written were $4,416 million in 2010, an increase of 4% from $4,253 million in 2009.   The increase in gross premiums written was primarily due to growth in international business as a result of expansion into new markets.  In 2010 and 2009, approximately 77% of policies expiring were renewed.  The average price of policies renewed in 2010 declined 0.3% from the same period in 2009.

Beginning in 2005, the property casualty insurance became more competitive and insurance rates decreased across most business lines.  Although price levels were generally stable in 2009 and 2010, current market price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the Company to achieve its return objectives.  Disparities between the Company's price levels and the pricing available in the market resulted in significant declines in gross premiums written for other liability, commercial automobile, excess workers' compensation and reinsurance during 2009 and 2010.  These declines have been more than offset by increased premiums from new business units and expansion into new markets.  A summary of gross premiums written in 2010 compared with 2009 by line of business within each business segment follows:

•

Specialty gross premiums increased 4% to $1,526 million in 2010 from $1,464 million in 2009.  Gross premiums increased 12% for property lines, 6% for professional liability and 2% for other liability.  Gross premiums decreased 18% for commercial automobile and 17% for products liability.

•

Regional gross premiums decreased 6% to $1,160 million in 2010 from $1,230 million in 2009.  Gross premiums decreased 6% for workers' compensation, 6% for commercial automobile and 3% for commercial multiple peril.  Gross premiums include assigned risk premiums, which are fully reinsured, of $36 million in 2010 and $66 million in 2009.  The decrease in assigned risk premiums was due to the transfer of certain assigned risk premiums from the regional segment to the alternative markets segment in 2010.

•

Alternative Markets gross premiums increased 6% to $703 million in 2010 from $665 million in 2009.  Gross premiums decreased 16% for excess workers' compensation and increased 1% for primary workers' compensation.  Gross premiums include fully reinsured assigned risk premiums of $67 million in 2010 and $24 million in 2009.   The increase is primarily due to the transfer from the regional segment described above.

•

Reinsurance gross premiums decreased 7% to $425 million in 2010 from $456 million in 2009.  Gross premiums decreased 10% to $288 million for casualty business and increased 1% to $137 million for property business.

•

International gross premiums increased 37% to $602 million in 2010 from $439 million in 2009.  The increase is primarily due to an increase in business written by our recently started operations in Canada, Norway and Brazil and our Lloyd's syndicate.   Gross premiums increased 144% for property lines, 30% for liability lines, 24% for workers' compensation, 20% for reinsurance assumed, 6% for automobile and 1% for professional liability.

Net premiums written were $3,851 million in 2010, an increase of 3% from $3,730 million in 2009. Ceded reinsurance premiums as a percentage of gross written premiums increased to 13% in 2010 from 12% in 2009. The increase in the percentage of business ceded was due to the increase in premiums written by new companies, which cede a higher portion of their gross premiums, and to growth in premiums written by assigned risk plans, which cede 100% of their gross premiums.


Premiums earned increased 1% to $3,836 million in 2010 from $3,806 million in 2009. Insurance premiums (including the impact of rate changes) are generally earned evenly over the policy term.  Premiums earned in 2010 are related to business written during both 2010 and 2009.

Net Investment Income

. Following is a summary of net investment income for 2010 and 2009:

Net investment income increased 40% to $531 million in 2010 from $379 million in 2009. The increase in investment income was due to a decrease in losses from investment funds (which are reported on a one quarter lag).  Average invested assets, at cost (including cash and cash equivalents) were $13.4 billion in 2010 and $12.9 billion in 2009.

Insurance Service Fees

.

Insurance service fees consist of fee-based services to help clients develop and administer self-insurance programs, primarily for workers' compensation coverage.  Service fees decreased to $85 million in 2010 from $93 million in 2009 due to a decline in fees received for claims administration services.

Net Investment Gains

.  The Company buys and sells securities on a regular basis in order to maximize its total return on investments.  Decisions to sell securities are based on management's view of the underlying fundamentals of specific securities as well as management's expectations regarding interest rates, credit spreads, currency values and general economic conditions.  Net realized gains on investment sales were $66 million in 2010 compared with $104 million in 2009.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments.

Other-than-temporary impairments were $9 million in 2010 compared with $143 million in 2009.  The impairment charge in 2009 was primarily related to debt and preferred stock of major financial institutions that experienced adverse credit events and ratings downgrades during the period, including write-downs of debt issued by Thornburg Mortgage, Inc. and preferred stock issued by Citibank and Bank of America.

Revenues from Wholly-Owned Investees

.  Revenues from wholly-owned investees were $214 million in 2010 compared with $189 million in 2009.  These revenues were derived from aviation-related businesses that were separately purchased in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  These companies provide services to the general aviation market, including fuel and line service, aircraft sales and maintenance, avionics and engineering services and parts fabrication.  The increase in 2010 revenues is due to the acquisition of an aviation company in June 2009, partially offset by lower aircraft sales in 2010.

Losses and Loss Expenses

. Losses and loss expenses decreased to $2,310 million in 2010 from $2,337 million in 2009. The consolidated loss ratio of 60.2% in 2010 was 1.2 points lower than the loss ratio of 61.4% in 2009.   Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement premiums, were $81 million in 2010 (including $8 million for the earthquake in Chile) compared with $63 million in 2009, an increase of  0.5 loss ratio points.  Favorable prior year reserve development was $234 million in 2010 compared with $190 million in 2009, a difference of 1.2 loss ratio points.  The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development decreased 0.5 points to 64.2% in 2010 from 64.7% in 2009.  A summary of loss ratios in 2010 compared with 2009 by business segment follows:

•

Specialty - The loss ratio of 58.3% in 2010 was 3.6 points lower than the loss ratio of 61.9% in 2009.  Favorable prior year reserve development was $99 million in 2010 compared with $69 million in 2009, a difference of  2.6 loss ratio points.  The loss ratio excluding favorable prior year reserve development decreased 1.0 points to 66.0% in 2010 from 67.0% in 2009.

•

Regional - The loss ratio was 60.7% in 2010 was 0.7 points lower than the loss ratio of 61.4% in 2009.    Catastrophe losses were $73 million in 2010 compared with $63 million in 2009, an increase of 1.3 loss ratio points.  Favorable prior year reserve development was $84 million in 2010 compared with $52 million in 2009, a difference of 3.2 loss ratio points. The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development increased 1.2


points to 61.7% in 2010 from 60.5% in 2009 due to earned pricing and loss cost trends.

•

Alternative Markets - The loss ratio of 67.6% in 2010 was 4.2 points higher than the loss ratio of 63.4% in 2009.    Favorable prior year development was $24 million in 2011 compared with $45 million in 2010, a difference of  3.7 loss ratio points. The loss ratio excluding favorable prior year reserve development increased 0.5 points to 71.5% in 2011 from 71.0% in 2010.

•

Reinsurance - The loss ratio of 52.5% in 2010 was 5.4 points lower than the loss ratio of 57.9% in 2009.   Catastrophe losses were $4 million, or 1.0 loss ratio points, in 2010 compared with none in 2009.  Favorable prior year reserve development was $26 million in 2010 compared with $16 million in 2009, a difference of 2.4 loss ratio points.  The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development decreased 4.0 points to 57.8% in 2010 from 61.8% in 2009.

•

International - The loss ratio of 61.8% in 2010 was 1.9 points higher than the loss ratio of 59.9% in 2009. Catastrophe losses were $4 million, or 0.9 loss ratio points, in 2010 compared with none in 2009.  Favorable prior year reserve development was $1 million in 2010 and $8 million in 2009, a difference of  2.1 loss ratio points.  The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development decreased 1.1 points to 61.2% in 2010 from 62.3% in 2009.

Other Operating Costs and Expenses.

Following is a summary of other operating costs and expenses for 2010 and 2009:

Underwriting expenses are comprised of commissions paid to agents and brokers, premium taxes and other assessments and internal underwriting costs.  The expense ratio (underwriting expenses expressed as a percentage of premiums earned) increased to 34.3% in 2010 from 32.8% in 2009 primarily due to higher expense ratios for certain underwriting units that experienced a significant decline in earned premiums in 2010.

Service expenses, which represent the costs associated with the fee-based businesses, decreased 8% to $72 million.  The decrease was due to lower employment costs and was in line with the rate of decrease in insurance service fees.

Net foreign currency gains and losses result from transactions denominated in a currency other than the operating unit's functional currency.  The loss in 2010 was primarily attributable to operating units in the U.K. and resulted from transactions denominated in Australian and Norwegian currencies.

Other costs and expenses, which represent general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to business segments, decreased 2% to $107 million.

Expenses from Wholly-Owned Investees

.

Expenses from wholly-owned investees were $208 million in 2010 compared to $183 million in 2009.  These expenses represent costs associated with aviation-related businesses that were separately purchased in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  These include cost of goods sold related to aircraft and other sales, labor and equipment costs related to repairs and other services and general and administrative expenses.  The increase in 2010 expenses is due to the acquisition of an aviation company in June 2009, partially offset by lower cost of aircraft sales in 2010.

Interest Expense

.  Interest expense increased 21.6% to $107 million primarily due to the issuance of $300 million of 7.375% senior notes in September 2009 and $300 million of 5.375% senior notes in September 2010, partially offset by the repayment of $150 million of 5.125% senior notes in September 2010.

Income Taxes

.  The effective income tax rate was 25% in 2010 as compared to 19% in 2009.  The effective income tax rate differs from the federal income tax rate of 35% primarily because of tax-exempt investment income.  Tax exempt investment income comprised a smaller portion of the 2010 pre-tax income and as such had a lower impact on the effective tax rate for 2010 compared with 2009.


Investments

As part of its investment strategy, the Company establishes a level of cash and highly liquid short-term and intermediate-term securities that, combined with expected cash flow, it believes is adequate to meet its payment obligations.

The Company also attempts to maintain an appropriate relationship between the average duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities (i.e., policy claims and debt obligations). The average duration of the investment portfolio was 3.6 years at

December 31, 2011

and


. The Company’s investment portfolio and investment-related assets as of

December 31, 2011

were as follows:

______________

(1)

Pre-refunded securities are securities for which an escrow account has been established to fund the remaining payments of principal and interest through maturity. Such escrow accounts are funded almost exclusively with U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities.


Fixed Maturity Securities

. The Company’s investment policy with respect to fixed maturity securities is generally to purchase instruments with the expectation of holding them to their maturity. However, management of the available for sale portfolio is considered necessary to maintain an approximate matching of assets and liabilities as well as to adjust the portfolio as a result of changes in financial market conditions and tax considerations.

The Company’s philosophy related to holding or selling fixed maturity securities is based on its objective of maximizing total return. The key factors that management considers in its investment decisions as to whether to hold or sell fixed maturity securities are its view of the underlying fundamentals of specific securities as well as its expectations regarding interest rates, credit spreads and currency values. In a period in which management expects interest rates to rise, the Company may sell longer duration securities in order to mitigate the impact of an interest rate rise on the fair value of the portfolio. Similarly, in a period in which management expects credit spreads to widen, the Company may sell lower quality securities, and in a period in which management expects certain foreign currencies to decline in value, the Company may sell securities denominated in those foreign currencies. The sale of fixed maturity securities in order to achieve the objective of maximizing total return may result in realized gains; however, there is no reason to expect these gains to continue in future periods.

At December 31, 2011, investments in foreign fixed maturity securities were as follows:

_______________

(1) Supranational represents investments in the North American Development Bank, European Investment Bank and Inter-American Development Bank.

Equity Securities Available for Sale

. Equity securities available for sale primarily represent investments in high-dividend yielding common and preferred stocks issued by large market capitalization companies.

Investment Funds

. At

December 31, 2011

, the carrying value of investment funds was $681 million, including investments in real estate funds of $373 million and investments in energy funds of $99 million.

Real Estate

.  Real estate is directly owned property held for investment.  At December 31, 2011, real estate consists of two office buildings in London, including one in operation and one under development, and a long-term ground lease in Washington D. C.

Arbitrage Trading Account

. The arbitrage trading account is comprised of direct investments in arbitrage securities. Merger arbitrage is the business of investing in the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers.

Loans Receivable

. Loans receivable, which are carried at amortized cost, have an aggregate cost of $263 million and an aggregate fair value of $245 million at

December 31, 2011

. Amortized cost of these loans is net of a valuation allowance of $20 million as of

December 31, 2011

. The six largest loans have an aggregate amortized cost of $187 million and an aggregate fair value of $166 million as of such date and are secured by commercial real estate. These loans earn interest at floating LIBOR-based interest rates and have maturities (inclusive of extension options) through March 2016. The loans are secured by office buildings (86%) and hotels (14%) located primarily in New York City, California, Hawaii and Boston.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow

. Cash flow provided from operating activities increased to $670 million in 2011 from $451 million in 2010.  The increase in cash flow was due primarily to an increase in premium collections and a decrease in income taxes paid, partially offset by an increase in underwriting expenses paid.  Paid losses as a percent of earned premiums were 59.8% in 2011 compared with 64.0% in 2010.

As a holding company, the Company derives cash from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends, tax payments and management fees. Maximum amounts of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval are prescribed by statute.  During 2012, the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately $417 million.  The ability of the holding company to service its debt obligations is limited by the ability of its insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends.  In the event dividends, tax payments and management fees available to the holding company were inadequate to service its debt obligations, the Company would need to raise capital, sell assets or restructure its debt obligations.

The Company's insurance subsidiaries' principal sources of cash are premiums, investment income, service fees and proceeds from sales and maturities of portfolio investments.  The principal uses of cash are payments for claims, taxes, operating expenses and dividends.  The Company expects its insurance subsidiaries to fund the payment of losses with cash received from premiums, investment income and fees.  The Company targets an average duration for its investment portfolio that is within one year of the average duration of its liabilities so that portions of its investment portfolio mature throughout the claim cycle and are available for the payment of claims if necessary.  In the event operating cash flow and proceeds from maturities and prepayments of fixed income securities are not sufficient to fund claim payments and other cash requirements, the remainder of the Company's cash and investments is available to pay claims and other obligations as they become due.  The Company's investment portfolio is highly liquid, with approximately 85% invested in cash, cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities as of December 31, 2011.  If the sale of fixed maturity securities were to become necessary, a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the cost and sales price of securities sold would be recognized.

Debt

. At

December 31, 2011

, the Company had senior notes, junior subordinated debentures and other debt outstanding with a carrying value of $1,744 million and a face amount of $1,761 million. The maturities of the outstanding debt are $4 million in 2012, $201 million in 2013, $26 million in 2014, $200 million in 2015, $2 million in 2016, $450 million in 2019, $300 million in 2020, $77 million in 2022, $1 million in 2023, $250 million in 2037 and $250 million in 2045.

Equity

.  The Company repurchased 5,218,097, 17,017,479 and 6,382,331 shares of its common stock in 2011, 2010 and  2009, respectively.  The aggregate cost of the repurchases was $157 million in 2011, $449 million in 2010 and $147 million in 2009.  At

December 31, 2011

, total common stockholders’ equity was $4 billion, common shares outstanding were 137,082,096, and stockholders’ equity per outstanding share was $29.15.

As further described in Note 1(Q) to the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company plans to apply new FASB guidance regarding deferred acquisition costs as of January 1, 2012.  The Company estimates that the effect of adopting this guidance will be a reduction in common stockholders' equity of between

$50 million

and $

60 million

as of January 1, 2012.

Total Capital

.

Total capitalization (equity, senior notes and other debt and junior subordinated debentures) was $5.8 billion at

December 31, 2011

. The percentage of the Company’s capital attributable to senior notes, junior subordinated debentures and other debt was 30% at

December 31, 2011

and 32% at

December 31, 2010

.

Federal and Foreign Income Taxes

The Company files a consolidated income tax return in the U.S. and foreign tax returns in each of the countries in which it has overseas operations.  At

December 31, 2011

, the Company had a deferred gross tax asset of $433 million (which primarily relates to loss and loss expense reserves and unearned premium reserves) and a gross deferred tax liability of $464 million (which primarily relates to deferred policy acquisition costs and unrealized investment gains).  The realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods.  Based on historical results and the prospects for future operations, management anticipates that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient for the realization of this asset.

The Company has not provided U.S. deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of approximately $66 million of its non-U.S. subsidiaries since these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in the non-U.S. subsidiaries.  However, in the future, if such earnings were distributed to the Company, taxes of approximately $5.0 million, assuming all tax credits are realized, would be payable on such undistributed earnings and would be reflected in the tax provision for the year in which these earnings are no longer intended to be permanently reinvested in the foreign subsidiary.


Reinsurance

The Company follows customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its exposures in exchange for, paying reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies it writes.  Reinsurance is purchased by the Company principally to reduce its net liability on individual risks and to protect it against catastrophic losses.  Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage.  The Company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers and attempts to place its coverages only with substantial and financially sound carriers.

The following table presents the credit quality of amounts due from reinsurers as of

December 31, 2011

(dollars in thousands).  Amounts due from reinsurers are net of reserves for uncollectible reinsurance of $3 million in the aggregate.

_________________

(1)

Rating represents S&P rating, or if not rated by S&P, A.M. Best rating.

(2)

The majority of "non-rated and other" consists of amounts due from government sponsored reinsurers and amounts that are secured by letters of credit or other forms of collateral.

(3)

Many states require licensed insurers that provide workers' compensation insurance to participate in programs that provide workers' compensation to employers that cannot procure coverage from an insurer on a voluntary basis.  Insurers can fulfill this residual market obligation by participating in pools where results are shared by the participating companies.  The Company acts as a servicing carrier for workers' compensation pools in 18 states.  As a servicing carrier, the Company writes residual market business directly and then cedes 100% of this business to the respective pool.  As a servicing carrier, the Company receives fee income for its services.  The Company does not retain underwriting risk, and credit risk is limited as ceded balances are jointly shared by all the pool members.

As of January 1, 2012, the Company's catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance program provides protection for losses between $30 million and $155 million for the majority of the primary business written by its U.S. companies.  The Company has separate catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance for business written through Lloyd's.  The catastrophe reinsurance agreements are subject to certain limits, exclusions and reinstatement premiums.


Contractual Obligations

Following is a summary of the Company's contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2011

(dollars in thousands):

The estimated payments for reserves for losses and loss expenses in the above table represent the projected (undiscounted) payments for gross loss and loss expense reserves related to losses incurred as of

December 31, 2011

.  The estimated payments in the above table do not consider payments for losses to be incurred in future periods.  These amounts include reserves for reported losses and reserves for incurred but not reported losses.  Estimated amounts recoverable from reinsurers are not reflected.  The estimated payments by year are based on historical loss payment patterns. The actual payments may differ from the estimated amounts due to changes in ultimate loss reserves and in the timing of the settlement of those reserves.

The Company utilizes letters of credit to back certain reinsurance payments and obligations.  Outstanding letters of credit were $29 million as of

December 31, 2011

.  The Company has made certain guarantees to state regulators that the statutory capital of certain subsidiaries will be maintained above certain minimum levels.  In addition, the Company has commitments to invest up to $328 million in certain investment funds.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the Company.  The Company has no arrangements of these types that management believes may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk

. The fair value of the Company’s investments is subject to risks of fluctuations in credit quality and interest rates. The Company uses various models and stress test scenarios to monitor and manage interest rate risk. The Company attempts to manage its interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate relationship between the average duration of the investment portfolio and the approximate duration of its liabilities (i.e., policy claims and debt obligations). The average duration for the fixed maturity portfolio was 3.6 years at

December 31, 2011

and

December 31, 2010

. In addition, the fair value of the Company’s international investments is subject to currency risk. The Company attempts to manage its currency risk by matching its foreign currency assets and liabilities where considered appropriate.


The following table outlines the groups of fixed maturity securities and their average duration at

December 31, 2011

:

Duration is a common measure of the price sensitivity of fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates.  The Company determines the estimated change in fair value of the fixed maturity securities, assuming parallel shifts in

the yield curve for treasury securities while keeping spreads between individual securities and treasury securities static. The estimated fair value at specified levels at

December 31, 2011

would be as follows (dollars in thousands):

Arbitrage investing differs from other types of investments in that its focus is on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period (usually four months or less). The Company believes that this makes arbitrage investments less vulnerable to changes in general stock market conditions. Potential changes in market conditions are also mitigated by the implementation of hedging strategies, including short sales.

Additionally, the arbitrage positions are generally hedged against market declines by purchasing put options, selling call options or entering into swap contracts. The Company's merger arbitrage securities are primarily exposed to the risk of completion of announced deals, which are subject to regulatory as well as transactional and other risks.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(A) Principles of consolidation and basis of presentation

The consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of W. R. Berkley Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company"), have been prepared on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  Reclassifications have been made in the


and


financial statements to conform to the presentation of the


financial statements.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the revenues and expenses reflected during the reporting period.  The most significant items on our balance sheet that involve a greater degree of accounting estimates that are subject to change in the future are the valuation of investments, other than temporary impairments, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and premium estimates.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(B) Revenue recognition

Insurance premiums are recognized as written at the inception of the policy.  Reinsurance premiums are estimated based upon information received from ceding companies, and subsequent differences from such estimates are recorded in the period they are determined.  Insurance and reinsurance premiums are primarily earned on a pro rata basis over the policy term.  Fees for services are earned over the period that the services are provided.

Audit premiums are recognized when they are reliably determinable.  The change in accruals for earned but unbilled audit premiums increased net premiums written and premiums earned by

$1 million

in


, and decreased net premiums written and premiums earned by

$7 million

and

$23 million

in


and


, respectively.

Revenues from wholly-owned investees are derived from services provided to the general aviation market, including fuel and line service, aircraft sales and maintenance, avionics and engineering services and parts fabrication.  Revenue is recognized upon delivery of aircraft, delivery of fuel, shipment of parts and upon completion of services.

(C) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of funds invested in money market accounts and investments with an effective maturity of three months or less when purchased.

(D) Investments

Fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale are carried at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable income taxes, excluded from earnings and reported as a component of comprehensive income and a separate component of stockholders' equity.  Fixed maturity securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost.  Investment income from fixed maturity securities is recognized based on the constant effective yield method.  Premiums and discounts on mortgage-backed securities are adjusted for the effects of actual and anticipated prepayments on a retrospective basis.

Equity securities classified as available for sale are carried at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable income taxes, excluded from earnings and reported as a component of comprehensive income and a separate component of stockholders' equity.

Equity securities that the Company purchased with the intent to sell in the near-term are classified as trading account securities and are reported at estimated fair value.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading activity are reported as net investment income and are recorded at the trade date.  Short sales and short call options are presented as trading securities sold but not yet purchased. Unsettled trades and the net margin balances held by the clearing broker are presented as a trading account receivable from brokers and clearing organizations.


Investment funds are carried under the equity method of accounting.  For certain investment funds, the Company's share of the earnings or losses is reported on a one-quarter lag in order to facilitate the timely completion of the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Loans receivable represent commercial real estate mortgage loans and bank loans and are carried at amortized cost. The Company monitors the performance of its loans receivable and establishes an allowance for loan losses for loans where the Company determines it is probable that the contractual terms will not be met, with a corresponding charge to earnings. For loans that are evaluated individually and deemed to be impaired, the Company establishes a specific allowance based on a discounted cash flow analysis and comparable cost and sales methodologies, if appropriate. Individual loans that are not considered impaired and smaller-balance homogeneous loans are evaluated collectively and a general allowance is established if it is considered probable that a loss has been incurred.

The accrual of interest on loans receivable is discontinued if the loan is 90 days past due based on the contractual terms of the loan unless the loan is adequately secured and in process of collection.  In general, loans are placed on non-accrual status or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.  Interest on these loans is accounted for on a cash basis until qualifying for return to accrual status.  Loans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.

Fair value is generally determined based on quoted market prices.  For publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable, the Company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data.  For securities traded only in private negotiations, the Company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities, which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer, financial data, projections and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information.

Realized gains or losses represent the difference between the cost of securities sold and the proceeds realized upon sale and are recorded at the trade date.  The Company uses primarily the first-in, first-out method to determine the cost of securities sold.

The cost of securities is adjusted where appropriate to include a provision for a decline in value which is considered to be other than temporary. An other-than-temporary decline is considered to occur in investments where there has been a sustained reduction in fair value and where the Company does not expect to recover the cost basis of the investment prior to the time of sale or maturity.  Since equity securities do not have a contractual cash flow or a maturity, the Company considers whether the price of an equity security is expected to recover within a reasonable period of time.

For fixed maturity securities that the Company intends to sell or, more likely than not, would be required to sell, a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be an other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”).  The amount of OTTI is equal to the difference between amortized cost and fair value at the balance sheet date.  For fixed maturity securities that the Company does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not it would not be required to sell, a decline in value below amortized cost is considered to be an OTTI if the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security

(i.e.,

the

present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security).  The portion of the decline in value considered to be a credit loss (i.e., the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security) is recognized in earnings.  The portion of the decline in value not considered to be a credit loss (i.e., the difference in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the fair value of the security) is recognized in other comprehensive income.

Impairment assessments for structured securities, including mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations and corporate debt, are generally evaluated based on the performance of the underlying collateral under various economic and default scenarios that may involve subjective judgments and estimates by management.  Modeling these securities involves various factors, such as projected default rates, the nature and realizable value of the collateral, if any, the ability of the issuer to make scheduled payments, historical performance and other relevant economic and performance factors. If an OTTI determination is made, a discounted cash flow analysis is used to ascertain the amount of the credit impairment.

Real estate held for investment purposes is initially recorded at the purchase price, which is generally fair value, and is subsequently reported at cost less accumulated depreciation. Real estate taxes, interest and other costs incurred during development and construction  are capitalized.  Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the building. Minimum rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Income and expenses from


real estate are reported as net investment income. The carrying value of real estate is reviewed for impairment and an impairment loss is recognized if the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the use and disposition of the property are less than the carrying value of the property.

(E) Per share data

The Company presents both basic and diluted net income per share (“EPS”) amounts.  Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.  Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year and is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock incentive plans.  Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect.  Stock options for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period have an anti-dilutive effect on EPS and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation.

(F) Deferred policy acquisition costs

Acquisition costs incurred in writing insurance and reinsurance business (primarily commissions and premium taxes) are deferred and amortized ratably over the terms of the related contracts. Ceding commissions received on reinsurance contracts are netted against acquisition costs and are recognized ratably over the life of the contract. Deferred policy acquisition costs are presented net of unearned ceding commissions. Deferred policy acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income and, if not, are charged to expense. The recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs is evaluated separately by each of our operating companies for each of their major lines of business. Future investment income is taken into account in measuring the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs.

(G) Reserves for losses and loss expenses

Reserves for losses and loss expenses are an accumulation of amounts determined on the basis of (1) evaluation of claims for business written directly by the Company; (2) estimates received from other companies for reinsurance assumed by the Company; and (3) estimates for losses incurred but not reported (based on Company and industry experience).  These estimates are periodically reviewed and, as experience develops and new information becomes known, the reserves are adjusted as necessary.  Such adjustments are reflected in the statements of income in the period in which they are determined.  The Company discounts its reserves for excess and assumed workers' compensation claims using a risk-free or statutory rate. (See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

(H) Reinsurance ceded

The unearned portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers is reported as prepaid reinsurance premiums and earned ratably over the policy term.  The estimated amounts of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses are reported as due from reinsurers.  To the extent any reinsurer does not meet its obligations under reinsurance agreements, the Company must discharge its liability.  Amounts due from reinsurers are reflected net of funds held where the right of offset is present.  The Company has provided reserves for estimated uncollectible reinsurance.

(I) Deposit accounting

Contracts that do not meet the risk transfer requirements of GAAP are accounted for using the deposit accounting method.  Under this method, an asset or liability is recognized at the inception of the contract based on consideration paid or received.  The amount of the deposit asset or liability is adjusted at subsequent reporting dates using the interest method with a corresponding credit or charge to interest income or expense.  Deposit liabilities for assumed reinsurance contracts were

$80 million

and

$95 million

at

December 31, 2011

and


, respectively.

(J) Federal and foreign income taxes

The Company files a consolidated income tax return in the U.S. and foreign tax returns in countries where it has  overseas operations.  The Company's method of accounting for income taxes is the asset and liability method.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates currently in effect or expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse.  Interest and penalties, if any, are reported as income tax expense.  The Company believes there are no tax positions that would require disclosure under GAAP. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.


(K) Foreign currency

Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency) are reported on the statements of income as other operating costs and expenses.  Unrealized gains or losses resulting from translating the results of non-U.S. dollar denominated operations are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated at the weighted average exchange rate during the year.  Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.

(L) Property, furniture and equipment

Property, furniture and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.  Depreciation expense was

$40 million

,

$41 million

and

$46 million

for


,


and


, respectively.

(M) Comprehensive income

Comprehensive income encompasses all changes in stockholders' equity (except those arising from transactions with stockholders) and includes net income, net unrealized holding gains or losses on available for sale securities, unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in unrecognized pension obligations.

(N) Goodwill and other intangible assets

Goodwill and other intangibles assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis and at interim periods where circumstances require.  The Company's impairment test as of

December 31, 2011

indicated that there were minimal impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets.  Intangible assets of

$29 million

are included in other assets as of

December 31, 2011

and


.

(O) Stock options

The costs resulting from all share-based payment transactions with employees are recognized in the consolidated financial statements using a fair-value-based measurement method.

(P) Statements of cash flows

Interest payments were

$111 million

,

$103 million

and

$80 million

in


,


and 2009, respectively.  Income taxes paid were

$48 million

,

$123 million

and

$16 million

in


,


and


, respectively.  Other non-cash items include acquisitions and dispositions, unrealized investment gains and losses and pension expense.  (See Note 2, Note 10 and Note 25 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

(Q) Recent accounting pronouncements

In October 2010, the FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board)  issued guidance regarding the treatment of costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. This guidance modifies the definition of the types of costs that can be capitalized and specifies that the costs must be directly related to the successful acquisition of a new or renewed insurance contract.   This guidance is effective for the quarter ending

March 31, 2012

.  The Company plans to apply this guidance retrospectively and estimates that the effect of adopting this guidance will be a reduction in common stockholders' equity of between

$50 million

and $

60 million

as of

January 1, 2012

.

All other recently issued but not yet effective accounting and reporting guidance is either not applicable to the Company, or is not expected to have a material impact on the Company.


(2)  Acquisitions

In


, the Company acquired a business that owned an office building in London for

$251 million

in cash and an inactive insurance company for

$23 million

in cash. Approximately

$2 million

of the aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was allocated to intangible assets.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:


(3)  Investments in Fixed Maturity Securities

At

December 31, 2011

and


, investments in fixed maturity securities were as follows:

_______________________________________

(1)

Gross unrealized losses for mortgage-backed securities include

$7,668,000

and

$4,064,000

, as of

December 31, 2011

and


, respectively, related to the non-credit portion of OTTI recognized in other comprehensive income.


The amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity securities at

December 31, 2011

, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations:

At

December 31, 2011

and


, there were no investments, other than investments in United States government and government agency securities, which exceeded

10%

of common stockholders’ equity. At

December 31, 2011

, investments with a carrying value of

$912 million

were on deposit in custodial or trust accounts, of which

$664 million

was on deposit with state insurance departments,

$155 million

was on deposit in support of the Company’s underwriting activities at Lloyd’s,

$64 million

was on deposit as security for reinsurance clients and

$29 million

was on deposit as security for letters of credit issued in support of the Company’s reinsurance operations.

(4)

Investments in Equity Securities Available for Sale

At

December 31, 2011

and


, investments in equity securities available for sale were as follows:

(5)  Arbitrage Trading Account

At

December 31, 2011

and


, the fair value and carrying value of the arbitrage trading account were

$397 million

and

$359 million

, respectively.  The primary focus of the trading account is merger arbitrage. Merger arbitrage is the business of investing in the securities of publicly held companies which are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers. Arbitrage investing differs from other types of investing in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a relatively short time period (usually four months or less). The Company believes that this makes arbitrage investments less vulnerable to changes in general financial market conditions.

The Company uses put options, call options and swap contracts in order to mitigate the impact of potential changes in market conditions on the merger arbitrage trading account. These options and contracts are reported at fair value. As of

December 31, 2011

, the fair value of long option contracts outstanding was

$8 million

(notional amount of

$86 million

) and the fair value of short option contracts outstanding was

$4 million

(notional amount of

$107 million

). Other than with respect to the use of these trading account securities, the Company does not make use of derivatives.

Net Investment Income

Net investment income consists of the following:

(7)  Investment Funds

Investment funds consist of the following:

(8)

Real Estate

Real estate is directly owned property held for investment.  At

December 31, 2011

, real estate consists of two office buildings in London, including one in operation and one under development, and a long-term ground lease in Washington D. C.  Future minimum rental income expected on operating leases relating to real estate held for investment is

$1,421,000

in


,

$1,464,000

in


,

$1,508,000

in


,

$1,553,000

in


,

$1,600,000

in


and

$331,476,000

thereafter.


(9)  Loans Receivable

Loans receivable are as follows (dollars in thousands):

Loans receivable in non-accrual status were $

30 million

and $

21 million

at

December 31, 2011

and


, respectively.  If these loans had been current, additional interest income of $

805,000

and $

340,000

would have been recognized in accordance with their original terms for the years ended

December 31, 2011

and


, respectively.

The Company monitors the performance of its loans receivable and assesses the ability of the borrower to pay principal and interest based upon loan structure, underlying property values, cash flow and related financial and operating performance of the property and market conditions. Loans receivable with a potential for default are further assessed using discounted cash flow analysis and comparable cost and sales methodologies, if appropriate.

The Company's six largest loans receivable, which have an aggregate amortized cost of

$187 million

and an aggregate fair value of

$166 million

at

December 31, 2011

, are secured by commercial real estate located primarily in New York City, California, Hawaii and Boston.  These loans earn interest at floating LIBOR-based interest rates and have maturities (inclusive of extension options) through

March 2016

.  As part of the evaluation process, the Company reviews certain credit quality indicators for these loans.  The Company utilizes an internal risk rating system to assign a risk to each of its commercial loans.  The loan rating system takes into consideration credit quality indicators including loan to value ratios, which compare the outstanding loan amount to the estimated value of the property, the borrower's financial condition and performance with respect to loan terms, the Company's position in the capital structure, and the overall leverage in the capital structure.  Based on this rating system, three loans with a cost basis of  $

58 million

were considered to be impaired at

December 31, 2011

and 2010.  For each of these loans, a determination was made as to the amount of loss in the event of a default and whether the loss is probable.  The results of the determination were considered in connection with the valuation allowance noted above.  An additional credit quality indicator is the debt service coverage ratio, which compares a property's net operating income to the borrower's principal and interest payments.  At

December 31, 2011

, each of the six largest loans referred to above have of debt service coverage ratios greater than

3.0

except one that is lower due to a recent and temporary rate abatement.


(10)

Realized and Unrealized Investment Gains and Losses

Realized and unrealized investment gains and losses are as follows:

_______________________________________

(1)

Includes change in valuation allowance for loans receivable of

$0

,

$6,082,000

and

$12,418,000

for the years ended

December 31, 2011

,


and


, respectively.


(11)  Securities in an Unrealized Loss Position

The following table summarizes all securities in an unrealized loss position at

December 31, 2011

and


by the length of time those securities have been continuously in an unrealized loss position.

Fixed Maturity Securities

— A summary of the Company’s non-investment grade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position at

December 31, 2011

is presented in the table below:

_______________________________________

(1)

This investment is a residential mortgage-backed security that was evaluated based on the performance of the underlying collateral under various economic and default scenarios.  The security has met its contractual obligations and the

Company expects that it will continue to meet those contractual payment obligations as they become due.  Based on this evaluation, the Company does not consider the investment to be OTTI.


For OTTI of fixed maturity securities that management does not intend to sell or, more likely than not, would not be required to sell, the portion of the decline in value considered to be due to credit factors is recognized in earnings and the portion of the decline in value considered to be due to non-credit factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. The table below provides a roll-forward of the portion of impairments recognized in earnings for those securities that have been impaired due to both credit factors and non-credit factors.

The Company has evaluated its fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and believes the unrealized losses are due primarily to temporary market and sector-related factors rather than to issuer-specific factors.

None

of these securities are delinquent or in default on financial covenants. Based on its assessment of these issuers, the Company expects them to continue to meet their contractual payment obligations as they become due and does not consider any of these securities to be OTTI.

Preferred Stocks

– At

December 31, 2011

, there were

six

preferred stocks in an unrealized loss position, with an aggregate fair value of

$69 million

and a gross unrealized loss of

$15 million

.

Four

of the six securities are investment-grade.  None of these securities are delinquent or in default.  Management believes the unrealized losses are due primarily to market and sector related factors and does not consider these to be OTTI.

Two

of those preferred stocks with an aggregate fair value of

$9 million

and a gross unrealized loss of

$5 million

are rated non-investment grade.

One

of these two securities representing most of the gross unrealized loss has recently reflected improved fundamentals.  The Company does not consider this security to be OTTI.

Common Stocks

– At

December 31, 2011

, there were

four

common stocks in an unrealized loss position with an aggregate fair value of

$47 million

and an aggregate unrealized loss of

$3 million

. The Company does not consider any of these securities to be OTTI.

(12)

Fair Value Measurements

The Company’s fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale and its trading account securities are carried at fair value. Fair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.

Because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis, the Company utilizes pricing models and processes which may include benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Market inputs used to evaluate securities include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data. Quoted prices are often unavailable for recently issued securities, securities that are infrequently traded or securities that are only traded in private transactions. For publicly traded securities for which quoted prices are unavailable, the Company determines fair value based on independent broker quotations and other observable market data. For securities traded only in private negotiations, the Company determines fair value based primarily on the cost of such securities, which is adjusted to reflect prices of recent placements of securities of the same issuer, financial projections, credit quality and business developments of the issuer and other relevant information.


The following tables present the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of

December 31, 2011

and


by level:

There were

no

transfers between Levels 1 and 2 for the year ended

December 31, 2011

.


The following tables summarize changes in Level 3 assets and liabilities for the years ended

December 31, 2011

and


:

The transfers out of Level 3 for mortgage-backed securities in


were based upon the availability of broker dealer quotations. In certain circumstances, the Company was able to obtain quotations from third party broker dealers.

For certain retrospectively rated insurance polices and reinsurance agreements, reserve development is offset by additional or return premiums. Favorable reserve development, net of additional and return  premiums, was

$182 million

,

$234 million

and

$190 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

For the year ended

December 31, 2011

, estimates for claims occurring in prior years (net of additional and return premiums) decreased by

$182 million

. The favorable reserve development in


was primarily attributable to accident years 2007 through 2009. The changes in prior year loss reserve estimates are generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends. Original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims and aggregate claim trends.

Environmental and Asbestos — To date, known environmental and asbestos claims have not had a material impact on the Company’s operations. These claims have not materially impacted the Company because its subsidiaries generally did not insure large industrial companies that are subject to significant environmental or asbestos exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language.

The Company’s net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were

$34 million

and

$36 million

at

December 31, 2011

and


, respectively. The Company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were

$59 million

and

$51 million

at

December 31, 2011

and


, respectively. Increases (decreases) in net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately

$1 million

,

$2 million

and

$(0.6) million

in


,


and


, respectively. Net paid losses and loss expenses for asbestos and environmental claims were approximately

$3 million

in


,

$3 million

in


and

$3 million

in


. The estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make an actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters, including coverage issues, as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues. Additionally, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain.

Discounting — The Company discounts its liabilities for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid. Discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to


income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities. The expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the Company’s loss payout experience. For non-proportional business, reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using risk-free discount rates determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. These discount rates range from

2.3%

to

6.5%

with a weighted average discount rate of

4.3%

. For proportional business, reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware of

2.3%

. The aggregate net discount, after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance, was

$892 million

,

$898 million

and

$877 million

at

December 31, 2011

,


and


, respectively.

(14)

Reinsurance

The following is a summary of reinsurance financial information:

The Company reinsures a portion of its exposures principally to reduce its net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. Estimated amounts due from reinsurers are reported net of reserves for uncollectible reinsurance of

$3,169,000

,

$3,098,000

and

$4,430,000

as of

December 31, 2011

,


and


, respectively. The following table presents the amounts due from reinsurers as of

December 31, 2011

(dollars in thousands):


(15)

Senior Notes and Other Debt

Senior notes and other debt consist of the following (the difference between the face value and the carrying value is unamortized discount):

(1)  Subsidiary debt is due as follows:

$4 million

in


,

$1 million

in


,

$26 million

in


and

$3 million

thereafter.

(16)

Junior Subordinated Debentures

In 2005, the Company issued $

250,000,000

aggregate principal amount of

6.75%

Junior Subordinated Debentures due July 26, 2045 (the “Debentures”) to W. R. Berkley Capital Trust II (the “Trust”). At

December 31, 2011

, the carrying value of the Debentures, net of unamortized discount, was $

243,000,000

. The Trust simultaneously issued an equal amount of

6.75%

mandatorily redeemable preferred securities (the “Trust Preferred Securities”), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company to the extent the Trust has funds available for payment of distributions. The Trust Preferred Securities are subject to mandatory redemption in a like amount (i) in whole but not in part upon repayment of the Debentures at maturity, (ii) in whole but not in part, at any time contemporaneously with the optional prepayment of the Debentures by the Company upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events.

(17)

Income Taxes

Income tax expense consists of:


Income before income taxes from domestic operations was

$469 million

,

$574 million

and

$343 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2011

,


and


, respectively.   Income before income taxes from foreign operations was

$49 million

,

$29 million

and

$39 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2011

,


and


, respectively.

A reconciliation of the income tax expense and the amounts computed by applying the Federal and foreign income tax rate of

35%

to pre-tax income are as follows:

At

December 31, 2011

and


, the tax effects of differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability are as follows:

The Company had current tax receivables of

$9,670,000

and

$23,605,000

at

December 31, 2011

and


, respectively. At

December 31, 2011

, the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of

$420,000

, which expire beginning in 2014. The Company had provided a valuation allowance against the unutilized foreign tax credits which were fully utilized in the 2010 federal tax return. The reduction in the valuation relates primarily to the full utilization of the foreign tax credit carryforward. At

December 31, 2011

, the Company had

no

deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance is required. The statute of limitations has closed for the Company’s tax returns through December 31, 2004. The 2005 calendar year statute of limitations remains open as a result of the carry back of capital losses from the 2008 tax year, and the 2006 calendar year statue of limitations remains open as a result of the carry back of capital losses from the 2008 and 2009 tax years.

The realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the Company’s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods. Based on historical results and the prospects for future current operations, management anticipates that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient for the realization of this asset.


(18)

Dividends from Subsidiaries and Statutory Financial Information (Unaudited)

The Company’s insurance subsidiaries are restricted by law as to the amount of dividends they may pay without the approval of regulatory authorities. During


, the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without such approval is approximately $

417 million

. Combined net income and policyholders’ surplus of the Company’s consolidated insurance subsidiaries, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices, are as follows:

The significant variances between statutory accounting practices and GAAP are that for statutory purposes bonds are carried at amortized cost, acquisition costs are charged to income as incurred, deferred Federal income taxes are subject to limitations, excess and assumed workers’ compensation reserves are discounted at different discount rates and certain assets designated as “non-admitted assets” are charged against surplus.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements that require insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk-based formula which measures statutory capital and surplus needs based on a regulatory definition of risk in a company’s mix of products and its balance sheet. As of

December 31, 2011

, all of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries had an RBC amount above the authorized control level RBC, as defined by the NAIC. The Company has guaranteed that the RBC levels of certain subsidiaries will remain above their authorized control levels.

(19)

Common Stockholders’ Equity

The weighted average number of shares used in the computation of net income per share was as follows:

Treasury shares have been excluded from average outstanding shares from the date of acquisition. The difference in calculating basic and diluted net income per share is attributable entirely to the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation plans.

Changes in shares of common stock outstanding, net of treasury shares, are presented below. Shares of common stock issued and outstanding do not include shares related to unissued restricted stock units and unexercised stock options.


(20)

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments as of

December 31, 2011

and


:

The estimated fair values of the Company’s fixed maturity securities, equity securities available for sale and arbitrage trading account securities are based on various valuation techniques. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for similar assets in active markets. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs may only be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available. The fair value of loans receivable are estimated by using current institutional purchaser yield requirements for loans with similar credit characteristics. The fair value of the senior notes and other debt and the junior subordinated debentures is determined based on spreads for similar securities.

(21) Lease Obligations

The Company and its subsidiaries use office space and equipment under leases expiring at various dates.  These leases are considered operating leases for financial reporting purposes.  Some of these leases have options to extend the length of the leases and contain clauses for cost of living, operating expense and real estate tax adjustments.  The Company also has an investment in a commercial office building that has a long-term land lease.  Future minimum lease payments, without provision for sublease income, are: $

34,635,000

in


; $

31,177,000

in


; $

26,808,000

in


; $

22,646,000

and $

173,015,000

thereafter.  Rental expense was $

33,003,000

, $

29,936,000

and $

28,067,000

for


,


and


, respectively.

(22)  Commitments, Litigation and Contingent Liabilities

The Company's subsidiaries are subject to disputes, including litigation and arbitration, arising in the ordinary course of their insurance and reinsurance businesses.  The Company's estimates of the costs of settling such matters are reflected in its aggregate reserves for losses and loss expenses, and the Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.   However, adverse outcomes are possible and could negatively impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

At

December 31, 2011

, the Company had commitments to invest up to $

328 million

in certain investment funds.


(23) Stock Incentive Plan

The Company has not issued any stock options under its stock incentive plan since 2004.  All outstanding options are vested and exercisable.  The following table summarizes stock option information:

five

years from the award date and are subject to other vesting and forfeiture provisions contained in the award agreement. The following table summarizes RSU information for the three years ended

December 31, 2011

:

Upon vesting, shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the number of vested RSUs are issued or deferred to a later date, depending on the terms of the specific award agreement. As of

December 31, 2011

,

2,641,177

shares related to vested RSUs had been deferred.

The fair value of RSUs at the date of grant are recorded as unearned compensation, a component of stockholders’ equity, and expensed over the vesting period. Following is a summary of changes in unearned compensation for the three years ended

December 31, 2011

:


(24)

Compensation Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries have profit sharing plans in which substantially all employees participate. The plans provide for minimum annual contributions of

5%

of eligible compensation; contributions above the minimum are discretionary and vary with each participating subsidiary’s profitability. Employees become eligible to participate in the profit sharing plans on the first day of the month following the first full

three

months in which they are employed. The plans provide that

40%

of the contributions vest immediately and that the remaining

60%

vest at varying percentages based upon years of service. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries provide pension benefits in accordance with local regulations. Profit sharing expense was

$27 million

,

$29 million

, and

$25 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

The Company has a Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (“LTIP”) that provides for incentive compensation to key executives based on the growth in the Company’s book value per share over a

five

year period. There are

193,600

units outstanding from the


grant with a maximum value of

$48.4 million

, of which

$5.6 million

(25)  Retirement Benefits

The Company has an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit plan that covers its chief executive officer and chairman of the board.  The plan provides that the benefits payments shall commence on the earliest of (i) January 2, 2014, (ii) the date of death or (iii) a change in control of the Company.  The discount rate used to derive the projected benefit obligation and related retirement expense was

4.36%

in


and

5.24%

in


.  The discount rate assumption used to determine the benefit obligation is based on a yield curve approach.  Under this approach, a weighted average yield is determined from a hypothetical portfolio of AA rated bonds.  Following is a summary of the projected benefit obligation as of

Industry Segments

The Company’s operations are presently conducted in

five

segments of the insurance business: Specialty, Regional, Alternative Markets, Reinsurance and International.

Our Specialty lines companies underwrite risks within the excess and surplus lines market and on an admitted basis. The risks are highly complex, often unique exposures that typically fall outside the underwriting guidelines of the standard insurance market or are best served by specialized knowledge of a particular industry.   The Specialty lines of business include premises operations, commercial automobile, property, products liability and professional liability lines. The customers in this segment are highly diverse.  Business is conducted through


operating units, each delivering their products through a variety of distribution channels, depending on the customer base and particular risks insured.

Our Regional companies provide insurance products and services that meet the specific needs of each regionally differentiated customer base by developing expertise in the niches that drive local communities.  They provide commercial insurance products to customers primarily in


states and the District of Columbia. Key clients of this segment are small-to-mid-sized businesses and state and local governmental entities. The Regional business is sold through a network of non-exclusive independent agents who are compensated on a commission basis. Our Regional operating units are organized geographically in order to provide them with the flexibility to adapt quickly to local market conditions and customer needs.

Our Alternative Markets operating units offer insurance products, analytical tools and risk management services such as loss control and claims management that enable clients to select their risk tolerance and manage it appropriately.  These units specialize in insuring, reinsuring and administering self-insurance programs and other alternative risk transfer mechanisms for clients such as commercial and governmental entity employers, employer groups, insurers, and other groups or entities seeking alternative ways to manage their exposure to risks. In addition to providing insurance products, the Alternative Markets segment also provides a wide variety of fee-based services, including claims, administrative and consulting services.

Our Reinsurance companies provide other insurance companies and self-insureds with assistance in managing their net risk through reinsurance on either a portfolio basis, through treaty reinsurance, or on an individual basis, through facultative reinsurance.

Our International operating units write business in almost


countries worldwide, with branches or offices in


locations outside the United States, including the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, South America, Australia, the Asia Pacific region, Scandinavia and Canada.  In each of our international operating territories, we have built decentralized structures that allow products and services to be tailored to each regional customer base.  Our international businesses are managed by teams of professionals with expertise in local markets and knowledge of regional environments.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Income tax expense and benefits are calculated based upon the Company’s overall effective tax rate.


Summary financial information about the Company’s operating segments is presented in the following table. Income (loss) before income taxes by segment consists of revenues less expenses related to the respective segment’s operations, including allocated investment income. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in or allocated to the operation of each segment.

Identifiable assets by segment were as follows (dollars in thousands):

_______________________________________

(1)

Corporate, other and eliminations represent corporate revenues and expenses, net investment gains and losses and other items that are not allocated to business segments.


Net premiums earned by major line of business are as follows:


(28)

Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)

The following is a summary of quarterly financial data (in thousands except per share data):

_______________________________________

(1)

Net income  per share (“EPS”) in each quarter is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during that quarter, while EPS for the full year is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year. Thus, the sum of the four quarters EPS does not necessarily equal the full-year EPS.


ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.  Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company has in place effective controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2011, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


Management's Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of Treadway Commission.  Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

W. R. Berkley Corporation:

We have audited W. R. Berkley Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company  as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, and our report dated February 28, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
