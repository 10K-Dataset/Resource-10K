SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT

UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

This is a “Safe Harbor” Statement under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Any forward-looking statements contained herein, including
statements related to our outlook for the industry and for our performance for
the year 2003 and beyond, are based upon the Company’s historical performance
and on current plans, estimates and expectations. The inclusion of this
forward-looking information should not be regarded as a representation by us or
any other person that the future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated
by us will be achieved. They are subject to various risks and uncertainties,
including but not limited to, the cyclical nature of the property casualty
industry, the long-tail and potentially volatile nature of the reinsurance
business, product demand and pricing, claims development and the process of
estimating reserves, the uncertain nature of damage theories and loss amounts,
the ultimate results of the various pending arbitration and legal proceedings,
the increased level of our retention, natural and man-made catastrophic losses,
including as a result of terrorist activities, the impact of competition, the
availability of reinsurance, the ability of our reinsurers to pay reinsurance
recoverables owed to us, investment results and potential impairment of
invested assets, exchange rate and political risks, legislative and regulatory
developments, changes in the ratings assigned to us by ratings agencies,
uncertainty as to our reinsurance coverage for terrorist acts, the availability
of dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries, our successful
integration of acquired companies or investment in new insurance ventures, our
ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and other risks detailed
from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. These risks could cause actual results of the industry or our
actual results for the year 2003 and beyond to differ materially from those
expressed in any forward-looking statement made by or on behalf of the Company.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made.



PART I

ITEM  1.     BUSINESS

W. R. Berkley Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is an insurance holding
company which, through its subsidiaries, operates in five segments of the
property casualty insurance business:

Our holding company structure provides us with the flexibility to respond
to local or specific market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches.
It also allows us to be closer to our customers in order to better understand
their individual needs and risk characteristics. Our structure allows us to
capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized capital,
investment and reinsurance management and actuarial, financial and legal staff
support.

Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this Form 10-K to “W. R.
Berkley,” “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or similar terms refer to W. R.
Berkley Corporation together with its subsidiaries.

Our specialty insurance, alternative markets and reinsurance operations
are conducted nationwide. Regional insurance operations are conducted
primarily in the Midwest, New England, Southern (excluding Florida) and Mid
Atlantic regions of the United States. International operations are conducted
primarily in Argentina and the Philippines.

During 2001, the Company discontinued its regional personal lines and
alternative markets reinsurance business. These discontinued businesses, which
were previously reported in the regional and reinsurance segments, are now
reported as a separate discontinued business segment. Segment information for
the prior period has been restated to reflect these changes.

Net premiums written as reported, based on accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), for each of the past five
years were as follows:



The following sections briefly describe our insurance segments. All of
the domestic insurance subsidiaries have an A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M.
Best”) rating of “A (Excellent)”, other than Admiral Insurance Company, which
has a rating of “A+ (Superior).” A.M. Best’s ratings are based upon factors of
concern to policyholders, insurance agents and brokers and are not directed
toward the protection of investors. A.M. Best states: “Best’s Ratings reflect
[its] opinion based on a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation
of a company’s balance sheet strength, operating performance and business
profile. Ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time for any
reason at the discretion of A.M. Best Company. These ratings are not a
warranty of an insurer’s current or future ability to meet its contractual
obligations, nor are they a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security.”
A.M. Best reviews its ratings on a periodic basis, and ratings of the Company’s
subsidiaries are therefore subject to change.

SPECIALTY INSURANCE

Our specialty segment underwrites complex and sophisticated third-party
liability risks, principally within the excess and surplus (“E&S”) lines,
professional liability, commercial transportation and surety markets. The
specialty business is conducted through seven operating units. The companies
within the segment are divided along the different customer bases and product
lines which they serve. The specialty units deliver their products through a
variety of distribution channels depending on the customer base and particular
risks insured. The customers in this segment are highly diverse.

Admiral Insurance Company (“Admiral”) provides E&S coverages to medium and
large-sized commercial risks that generally involve moderate to high degrees of
risk. Admiral concentrates on commercial casualty, professional liability and
commercial property lines of business produced by wholesale brokers.

Carolina Casualty Insurance Company (“Carolina”) specializes in
transportation insurance for long-haul trucking and public automobile risks,
operating as an admitted carrier in all states.

Nautilus Insurance Company (“Nautilus”) insures E&S risks which involve a
lower degree of expected severity than those covered by Admiral. A substantial
portion of Nautilus’ business is written on a binding authority basis, subject
to certain contractual limitations.

Monitor Liability Managers, Inc. (“Monitor”) specializes in professional
liability insurance, including directors’ and officers’ liability, employment
practices liability lawyers’ professional liability, management liability, and
non-profit directors’ and officers’ liability coverages.

Clermont Specialty Managers, Ltd. (“Clermont”) writes package insurance
programs for luxury condominium, cooperative and rental apartment buildings and
restaurants in the New York City metropolitan area.

Monitor Surety Managers, Inc. (“Surety”) writes contract bonds, court and
fiduciary bonds, license and permit bonds, and public official bonds, with a
primary focus on providing surety bonds to mid-sized contractors.

Berkley Medical Excess Underwriters, LLC (“Medical Excess”) was
established at the end of 2001 to provide medical malpractice excess insurance
and reinsurance coverage and services to hospitals and hospital associations.

ALTERNATIVE MARKETS

Our alternative markets operations specialize in developing, insuring,
reinsuring and administering self-insurance programs and other alternative risk
transfer mechanisms. Our clients include employers, employer groups, insurers,
and alternative market funds seeking less costly, more efficient ways to manage
exposure to risks. In addition to providing insurance, the alternative markets
segment also provides a wide variety of fee-based services, including
consulting and administrative services.

Each of our alternative markets operating units is involved in risk
management and is organized according to one of the following product areas:
insuring excess workers’ compensation risks; insuring primary workers’
compensation risks; and providing non-risk bearing administrative services
nationwide.

Midwest Employers Casualty Company (“MECC”) provides excess workers’
compensation coverage to self-insured employers and groups above their
self-insured or retained limits.

Key Risk Insurance Company (“Key Risk”) offers primary workers’
compensation insurance in North Carolina. Insurance services are also provided
through its affiliate, Key Risk Management Services.

Preferred Employers Insurance Company (“Preferred Employers”) offers
primary workers’ compensation insurance in California. Insurance coverage is
provided primarily to owner-managed small employers.

REINSURANCE OPERATIONS

Our reinsurance operations consist of seven operating units, which
specialize in underwriting property casualty reinsurance on both a treaty and a
facultative basis.

Signet Star Re, LLC (“Signet Star”) functions as a traditional reinsurer
that focuses on specialty lines of business where knowledge and expertise in a
specific area is valued over the capital scale of the reinsurance provider.
Signet Star emphasizes casualty excess of loss treaties and prefers to take
significant participations in order to have greater influence over the terms
and conditions of coverage. Signet Star is committed exclusively to the broker
market segment of the treaty reinsurance industry.

Lloyd’s Reinsurance represents quota share reinsurance contracts with MAP
Capital Limited, a Lloyd’s corporate member, and two Lloyd’s syndicates managed
by Kiln plc. Map Capital Limited and the Lloyd’s syndicates underwrite a broad
range of mainly short-tail classes of business on a worldwide basis.

Facultative ReSources, Inc. (“Fac Re”) specializes in individual
certificate and program facultative business developed through brokers. Its
highly experienced underwriters seek to offset the underwriting and pricing
cycles in the underlying insurance business by developing risk management
solutions and through superior risk selection. Casualty facultative business
is written on a direct basis by Fac Re’s affiliate, BF Re Underwriting, LLC.

Vela Insurance Services, LLC (“Vela”) is an excess and surplus lines
underwriting manager that specializes in providing general liability and
product liability coverages to small and medium size accounts.

Berkley Underwriting Partners, LLC (“Berkley Underwriting Partners”)
oversees managing general underwriting (MGU) program business.

Berkley Capital Underwriters, LLC (“Berkley Capital Underwriters”) offers
quota share reinsurance to insurance companies where capital constraint is the
primary obstacle to increasing their underwriting activities.

reinsurance coverage to a limited number of small fidelity and surety accounts.

REGIONAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS

Our regional subsidiaries provide commercial insurance products to
customers primarily in 32 states. Key clients of this segment are
small-to-mid-sized businesses and governmental entities. The regional
subsidiaries are organized geographically, which provides them with the
flexibility to adapt to local market conditions, while enjoying the superior
administrative capabilities and financial strength of W. R. Berkley. The
regional operations are conducted through four geographic regions based on
markets served: Midwest, New England, Southern (excluding Florida) and Mid
Atlantic.

The regional subsidiaries primarily sell our insurance products through a
network of non-exclusive independent agents who are compensated on a commission
basis. Our regional companies underwrite all major commercial lines.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

In 1995, the Company and Northwestern Mutual Life International, Inc.
(“NML”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance
Company, entered into a joint venture to form Berkley International, LLC
(“Berkley International”), a limited liability company. We agreed to contribute
up to $65 million to Berkley International in exchange for a 65% membership
interest and NML agreed to contribute up to $35 million to Berkley
International in exchange for a 35% membership interest.

Applying the same approach that we take for our domestic businesses, we
believe that decentralized control is key to the success of our international
effort. For example, we hire local insurance executives who have specialized
knowledge of their customers, markets and products, and we link their
compensation to meeting performance objectives.

International operations are conducted in Argentina and the Philippines.
In Argentina, we currently offer commercial and personal property casualty
insurance. Our Argentine subsidiary ceased writing life insurance business in
2002 and began a process of liquidating its life insurance in-force. In the
Philippines, we provide savings and life products to customers, including
endowment policies to pre-fund education costs and retirement income.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

In March 2003, the Company announced that it intends to form a United
Kingdom authorized insurance company. It is expected that the enterprise will
be London-based and will specialize in principally U.K. domestic casualty
risks. It is anticipated that the company will commence operation in the third
quarter of 2003, subject to regulatory and other approvals.

During the first quarter of 2003, the Company issued $200 million (face

Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves

In the property casualty insurance industry, it is not unusual for
significant periods of time to elapse between the occurrence of an insured
loss, the report of the loss to the insurer and the insurer’s payment of that
loss. To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, insurers establish reserves,
which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts
needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which
have occurred. Our loss reserves reflect current estimates of the ultimate cost
of closing outstanding claims. Other than our excess workers’ compensation
business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business, as
discussed below, we do not discount our reserves for financial reporting
purposes.

In general, when a claim is reported, claims personnel establish a “case
reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment. The estimate
represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and
reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the
nature and value of the specific type of claim. Reserves are also established
on an aggregate basis which provide for losses incurred but not yet reported to
the insurer, potential inadequacy of case reserves, the estimated expenses of
settling claims, including legal and other fees and general expenses of
administering the claims adjustment process (“LAE”), and a provision for
potentially uncollectible reinsurance.

In examining reserve adequacy, several factors are considered, including
historical data, legal developments, changes in social attitudes and economic
conditions, including the effects of inflation. The actuarial process relies on
the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted judgmentally for the
effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis
for predicting future events. Reserve amounts are necessarily based on
management’s informed estimates and judgments using data currently available.
As additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed,
these estimates and judgments are revised. This may result in increases or
decreases to reserves for insured



events of prior years. The reserving process implicitly recognizes the
impact of inflation and other factors affecting loss costs by taking into
account changes in historical claim patterns and perceived trends. There is no
precise method to evaluate the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of
reserves, because the ultimate cost of closing claims is influenced by numerous
factors.

While the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time,
some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are
subject to fluctuation. In particular, high levels of jury verdicts against
insurers, as well as judicial decisions which “re-formulate” policies to expand
coverage to include previously unforeseen theories of liability, e.g., those
regarding pollution, other environmental exposures or man-made catastrophes,
have produced unanticipated claims and increased the difficulty of estimating
the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves.

We discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and
the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the
long period of time over which losses are paid. Discounting is intended to
appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment
securities supporting the liabilities. The expected losses and loss expense
payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the Company’s loss
payout experience and is supplemented with data compiled from insurance
companies writing similar business. The liabilities for losses and loss
expenses have been discounted using risk-free discount rates determined by
reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for non-proportional business, and
at the statutory rate for proportional business. The discount rates range from
3.9% to 6.5% with a weighted average rate of 5.3%. The aggregate net discount,
after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance, is $293,000,000,
$243,000,000 and $223,000,000 at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

To date, known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company
subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations. Environmental
claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did
not insure the larger industrial companies which are subject to significant
environmental exposures.

Our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to
asbestos and environmental claims were $28,509,000 and $24,794,000 at December
31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company’s gross reserves for losses and
loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were
$47,637,000 and $43,405,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net
incurred losses and loss expenses (recoveries) for reported asbestos and
environmental claims were approximately $6,652,000, ($4,503,000) and $1,602,000
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net paid losses and loss expenses
(receivables) for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately
$2,938,000, $125,000 and $3,123,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal
variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable
actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally
accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential affect of
significant unresolved legal matters, including coverage issues as well as the
cost of litigating the legal issues. Additionally, the determination of
ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially
responsible parties are highly uncertain.

The following table sets forth the components of our gross loss reserves
and net provision for losses and loss expense (amounts in thousands):

For statutory purposes, we use a discount rate of 3.9% as

The following table presents the development of net reserves for 1992
through 2002. The top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid
losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the
indicated years. This represents the estimated amount of losses and loss
expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance
sheet date, including losses that had been incurred but not yet reported to us.
The upper portion of the table shows the re-estimated amount of the previously
recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year.
The estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and
severity of claims for individual years.

The “cumulative redundancy (deficiency)” represents the aggregate change
in the estimates over all prior years. For example, the 1992 reserves have
developed a $162 million redundancy over ten years. That amount has been
reflected in income over the ten years. The impact on the results of operations
of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the
reconciliation tables above. It should be noted that the table presents a “run
off” of balance sheet reserves, rather than accident or policy year loss
development. Therefore, each amount in the table includes the effects of
changes in reserves for all prior years. For example, assume a claim that
occurred in 1992 is reserved for $2,000 as of December 31, 1992. Assuming this
claim estimate was changed in 2002 to $2,300, and was settled for $2,300 in
2002, the $300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 1992
through 2001.





Reinsurance

We follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our
exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the
policies that we write. Reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net
liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses.
Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary
liability for the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming
reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage. We
monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our
coverages only with substantial, financially sound carriers. As a result,
generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an A.M.
Best rating of “A (Excellent)” or better with $500 million in policyholder
surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an A.M.
Best rating of “A-(Excellent)” or better with $250 million in policyholder
surplus. As a result of the attacks of September 11, many reinsurers have
significantly changed their underwriting guidelines, and limit or no longer
provide terrorism coverage. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Result of Operations” and Note 10 of “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Regulation

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation
and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business. They are
subject to statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative
powers to state insurance commissioners. This regulation relates to such
matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; the
licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on
investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval
of policy forms and premium rates; periodic examination of the affairs of
insurance companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the
financial condition of insurers or for other purposes; establishment and
maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses; and requirements
regarding numerous other matters. Our property casualty subsidiaries, other
than E&S and reinsurance subsidiaries, must file all rates for personal and
commercial insurance with the insurance department of each state in which they
operate. Our E&S and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate
and form regulation.

In addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries, we
are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems.
Typically, such statutes require that we periodically file information with the
state insurance commissioner, including information concerning our capital
structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations.
Under the terms of applicable state statutes, any person or entity desiring to
purchase more than a specified percentage (commonly 10%) of our outstanding
voting securities would be required to obtain regulatory approval of the
purchase. Under Florida law, which is applicable to us due to our ownership of
Carolina Casualty Insurance Company, a Florida domiciled insurer, the
acquisition of more than 5% of our capital stock must receive regulatory
approval. Further, state insurance statutes typically place limitations on the
amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in
order to protect their solvency. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Various state and federal organizations, including Congressional
committees and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”),
have been conducting reviews into various aspects of the insurance business.
The NAIC codified statutory accounting practices for certain insurance
enterprises effective January 1, 2001. No assurance can be given that future
legislative or regulatory changes resulting from such activity will not
adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries.

The NAIC utilizes a Risk Based Capital (RBC) formula which is designed to
measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks
inherent in its business. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target
level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various
asset, premium and reserve items. The RBC Model Law provides for four
incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below
the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from
requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually
placing the insurer under regulatory control. The RBC of each of our domestic
insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized control level RBC as of
December 31, 2002.



The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or Financial Services Modernization Act of
1999 (the “Act”), was enacted in 1999 and significantly affects the financial
services industry, including insurance companies, banks and securities firms.
The Act modifies federal law to permit the creation of financial holding
companies (“FHCs”), which, as regulated by the Act, can maintain cross-holdings
in insurance companies, banks and securities firms to an extent not previously
allowed. The Act also permits or facilitates certain types of combinations or
affiliations for FHCs. The Act establishes a functional regulatory scheme
under which state insurance departments will maintain primary regulation over
insurance activities, subject to provisions for certain federal preemptions. It is not anticipated that the insurance regulatory aspects of
the Act will have a material effect on our operations.

Our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state
guaranty funds when an insurer in that jurisdiction has been judicially
declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated
company to pay policyholders and claimants. The protection afforded under a
state’s guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from
state to state. Generally, all licensed property casualty insurers are
considered to be members of the fund, and assessments are based upon their pro
rata share of direct written premiums. The NAIC Model Post-Assessment Guaranty
Fund Act, which many states have adopted, limits assessments to an insurer to
2% of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate
setting. Likewise, several states (or underwriting organizations of which our
insurance subsidiaries are required to be members) have limited assessment
authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business.

We receive funds from our insurance subsidiaries in the form of dividends
and fees for certain management services. Annual dividends in excess of maximum
amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of
the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is
domiciled.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (“TRIA”) became effective
November 26, 2002. TRIA establishes a temporary Federal program that provides
for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses
resulting from acts of terrorism. The program terminates on December 31, 2005.
TRIA is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty
insurance. Insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance
exposure in the United States are required to participate in the program and
make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism. Federal participation
will be triggered under TRIA when the Secretary of Treasury certifies an act of
terrorism. Under the program the federal government will pay 90% of an
insurer’s losses in excess of the insurer’s applicable deductible. The
insurer’s deductible is based on a percent of earned premium for covered lines
of commercial property and casualty insurance: for 2003 the deductible is 7% of
2002 premium, for 2004 it is 10% of 2003 premium and for 2005 it is 15% of 2004
premium. TRIA limits the federal governments share of losses at $100 billion
for a program year. In addition, an insurer that has satisfied its deductible
is not liable for the payment of losses in excess of the $100 billion cap.

Competition

The property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are
competitive, with over 2,000 insurance companies transacting business in the
United States. We compete directly with a large number of these companies. Our
strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or
geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive
advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions. Each of our
subsidiaries establishes its own pricing practices. Such practices are based
upon a Company-wide philosophy to price products with the general intent of
making an underwriting profit. Competition in the industry generally changes
with profitability.

Competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from
other specialty insurers, regional carriers, large national multi-line
companies and reinsurers. Under certain market conditions, standard carriers
also compete for E&S business.

Competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign
reinsurers, which produce their business either on a direct basis or through
the broker market. These competitors include Berkshire Hathaway, Employers
Reinsurance, Transatlantic Reinsurance and



Everest Reinsurance, which collectively comprise a majority of the
property casualty reinsurance market in the United States.

The regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual and other
regional stock companies as well as national carriers. Direct writers of
property casualty insurance compete with the regional subsidiaries by writing
insurance through their salaried employees, generally at a lower cost than
through independent agents such as those used by the Company.

The international operations compete with native insurance operations both
large and small, which may be related to government entities, as well as with
branch or local subsidiaries of multinational companies.

Employees

As of March 8, 2003, we employed 4,359 persons. Of this number, our
subsidiaries employed 4,305 persons, of whom 2,012 were executive and
administrative personnel and 2,293 were clerical personnel. We employed the
remaining 54 persons at the parent company and in investment operations, of
whom 42 were executive and administrative personnel and 12 were clerical
personnel.

Other Information about the Company’s business

We maintain an interest in the acquisition or start up of complementary
businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on
an ongoing basis. In addition, the insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages
or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds.

Seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and
frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries.
Although the effect on our business of such catastrophes as tornadoes,
hurricanes, hailstorms, earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by
reinsurance, they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of
any one or more reporting periods.

We have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our
consolidated revenues.

Compliance by W. R. Berkley and its subsidiaries with federal, state and
local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of the
environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position.

CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

Our business faces significant risks. The risks described below may not be
the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we
currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any
of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs, our
business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and
adversely affected.

Our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical
changes in the insurance and reinsurance industry.

The results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry
historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties.
The demand for insurance is influenced primarily by general economic
conditions, while the supply of insurance is directly related to available
capacity. The adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and
frequency of claims, which are influenced by many factors, including natural
disasters, regulatory measures and court decisions that define and expand the
extent of coverage and the effects of economic inflation on the amount of
compensation due for injuries or losses. In addition, investment rates of
return may impact policy rates. These factors can have a significant impact on
ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced
before its costs are known, as premiums usually are determined long before
claims are reported. These factors could produce results that would have a
negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, which may require
us to establish additional reserves.

We maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for unpaid
losses and loss adjustment expenses, including legal and other fees as well as
a portion of our general expenses, for reported and unreported claims incurred
as of the end of each accounting period. Reserves do not represent an exact
calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what we
expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost. These
estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on our
assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of
future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and
other factors. In some cases, long-tail lines of business such as excess
workers’ compensation and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance
business are reserved on a discounted basis. The variables described above are
affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims
handling procedures, inflation, judicial and litigation trends and legislative
changes.

The risk of the occurrence of such events is especially present in our
specialty and reinsurance businesses as well as our discontinued alternative
markets reinsurance business. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable
in advance. In some areas of our business, the level of reserves we establish
is dependent in part upon the actions of third parties that are beyond our
control. In our reinsurance and excess workers’ compensation businesses, we may
not establish sufficient reserves if third parties do not give us advance
notice or provide us with appropriate information regarding certain matters.
Additionally, there may be a significant delay between the occurrence of the
insured event and the time it is reported to us.

The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain
types of liabilities, where the various considerations affecting these types of
claims are subject to change and long periods of time may elapse before a
definitive determination of liability is made. For example, there are greater
uncertainties involved with establishing reserves relating to the World Trade
Center attack, the Enron bankruptcy and asbestos and environmental claims.
Reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience
develops and further claims are reported and settled. Adjustments to reserves
are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are
changed. Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain, we cannot assure you
that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.
Should we need to increase our reserves, our net income for the period will
decrease by a corresponding amount.

Our earnings could be more volatile, especially since we have increased and may
further increase our level of retention in our business.

We increased our retention levels in 2001 and 2002 due to changes in
market conditions and the pricing environment. We purchased less reinsurance,
the process by which we transfer, or cede, part of the risk we have assumed to
a reinsurance company, thereby retaining more risk. We may further increase our
retention levels in the future. As a result, our earnings



could be more volatile and increased severities are more likely to have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A
significant change in our retention levels could also cause our historical
financial results, including compound annual growth rates, to be inaccurate
indicators of our future performance on a segment or consolidated basis.

As a property casualty insurer, we face losses from natural and man-made
catastrophes.

Property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of
catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations,
liquidity and financial condition. Catastrophe losses have had a significant
impact on our results. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including
hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, severe winter
weather and fires, as well as terrorist activities. The incidence and severity
of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. For example, during the five
years ended December 31, 2002, our losses from natural and man-made
catastrophes ranged from $xx million to $xx million. The extent of losses from
a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the
area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are
restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes and earthquakes may
produce significant damage in large, heavily populated areas. Catastrophes can
cause losses in a variety of our property casualty lines, and most of our past
catastrophe-related claims have resulted from severe storms. Seasonal weather
variations may affect the severity and frequency of our losses. Insurance
companies are not permitted to reserve for a catastrophe until it has occurred.
It is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic
events could produce unforeseen losses and have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition.

We face significant competitive pressures in our businesses, which may reduce
premium rates and prevent us from pricing our products at attractive rates.

We compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of
business. We compete, and will continue to compete, with major U.S. and
non-U.S. insurers and reinsurers, other regional companies, as well as mutual
companies, specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies and diversified
financial services companies. Competition in our businesses is based on many
factors, including the perceived financial strength of the company, premium
charges, other terms and conditions offered, services provided, ratings
assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment and reputation
and experience in the lines to be written.

Some of our competitors, particularly in the reinsurance business, have
greater financial and marketing resources than we do. These competitors within
the reinsurance segment include Employers Reinsurance, Berkshire Hathaway and
American Reinsurance, which collectively comprise a majority of the property
casualty reinsurance market. We expect that perceived financial strength, in
particular, will become more important as customers seek high quality
reinsurers.

New competition could cause the supply and/or demand for insurance or
reinsurance to change, which could affect our ability to price our products at
attractive rates and thereby adversely affect our underwriting results.

If market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable, we may
be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting
commitments.

As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase
reinsurance for significant amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance
company subsidiaries, especially catastrophe risks. We also purchase
reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure. Market
conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the
reinsurance protection we purchase, which may affect the level of our business
and profitability. Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual
renewal. We may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or to
obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates.
If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance
facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling to
bear an increase in net exposures, we would have to reduce the level of our
underwriting commitments, especially catastrophe exposed risks.

We, as a primary insurer, may have significant exposure for terrorist acts.

To the extent that reinsurers have excluded coverage for terrorist acts or
have priced such coverage at rates that we believe are not practical, we, in
our capacity as a primary insurer, do not have reinsurance protection and are
exposed for potential losses as a result



of any terrorist acts. To the extent an act of terrorism certified by the
Secretary of the Treasury under The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of
2002(“TRIA”), our mandatory deductible under TRIA could be a material amount.

We cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion, if at
all, and, as a result, we could experience losses.

We purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have
assumed, known as ceding, to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the
premium we receive in connection with the risk. Although reinsurance makes the
reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the
reinsurer, it does not relieve us, the reinsured, of our liability to our
policyholders or, in cases where we are a reinsurer, to our reinsureds. Our
reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they
may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis. Accordingly, we bear credit
risk with respect to our reinsurers, and if our reinsurers fail to pay us, our
financial results would be adversely affected. Underwriting results and
investment returns of some of our reinsurers may affect their future ability
to pay claims.

We invest some of our assets in alternative investments, which is subject to
certain risks.

We invest a portion of our investment portfolio in alternative investments
which is primarily merger arbitrage. Merger arbitrage is the business of
investing in the securities of publicly held companies which are the targets in
announced tender offers and mergers. Merger arbitrage differs from other types
of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring
about a change in value over a relatively short time period, usually four
months or less. While our merger arbitrage positions are generally hedged
against market declines, these equity investments are exposed primarily to the
risk associated with the completion of announced deals, which are subject to
regulatory as well as political and other risks. As a result of the reduced
activity in the merger and acquisitions area, we may not be able achieve the
returns that we have enjoyed in the past. Alternative investments also include
investments in high-yield bonds and real estate investment trusts.

A significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed income securities and
is subject to market fluctuations.

Our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed income
securities. The fair market value of these assets and the investment income
from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market
conditions. With respect to our investments in fixed income securities, the
fair market value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an
inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment
income realized by us from future investments in fixed income securities will
generally increase or decrease with interest rates. In addition, actual net
investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment
risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ
from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate
fluctuations. Further, the value of any particular fixed income security is
subject to impairment based on the credit worthiness of a given issuer. Because
substantially all of our fixed income securities are classified as available
for sale, changes in the market value of our securities are reflected in our
balance sheet. Similar treatment is not available for liabilities. Therefore,
interest rate fluctuations affect the value of our investments and could
adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations in Argentina and the Philippines expose us to investment,
political and economic risks.

Our operations in Argentina and the Philippines expose us to investment,
political and economic risks, including foreign currency and credit risk.
Changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and either the Argentine
or Philippine peso could have an adverse effect on our results of operations
and financial condition. Argentina has experienced substantial political and
economic problems it is likely that there will be further changes to Argentine
economic and monetary policies in the future. These changes may result in
further impairment in value of Argentine bonds and a decline in investment
income as a result of lower interest on bonds

We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which increases our costs
and could restrict the conduct of our business.

We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision. Most
insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders
rather than stockholders



and other investors. This system of regulation, generally administered by
a department of insurance in each state in which we do business, relates to,
among other things:

State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs
of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports
relating to the financial condition of insurance companies, holding company
issues and other matters. Recently adopted federal financial services
modernization legislation is expected to lead to additional federal regulation
of the insurance industry in the coming years. Also, foreign governments
regulate our international operations.

We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our
business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and
regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and
regulations. Also, some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion
to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the
requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory
requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or
temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or
monetarily penalize us. Also, changes in the level of regulation of the
insurance industry, whether federal, state or foreign, or changes in laws or
regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities, restrict
the conduct of our business. The growing number of insolvencies in the
insurance industry increases the possibility that we will be assessed pursuant
to various state guaranty fund requirements.

We are rated by A.M. Best and Standard & Poor’s, and a decline in these ratings
could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and
earnings to decrease.

Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the
competitive position of insurance companies. Our insurance company subsidiaries
are rated by A.M. Best, and certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are
rated for their claims-paying ability by Standard & Poor’s Corporation, or
Standard & Poor’s. A.M. Best and Standard & Poor’s ratings reflect their
opinions of an insurance company’s financial strength, operating performance,
strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders, are
not evaluations directed to investors and are not recommendations to buy, sell
or hold our securities. Our ratings are subject to periodic review by A.M. Best
and Standard & Poor’s, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain
those ratings. Our A.M. Best rating is A+ (Superior) for Admiral Insurance
Company and A (Excellent) for our other insurance companies rated by A. M.
Best. The Standard & Poor’s financial strength rating for our insurance
subsidiaries is A+/negative. If our ratings are reduced from their current
levels by A.M. Best and/or Standard & Poor’s, our competitive position in the
insurance industry could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market
our products. A significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of
business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claims-paying and
financial strength ratings.

We are an insurance holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive
dividends in needed amounts.

Our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance
company subsidiaries. We have to rely on dividends from our insurance company
subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on
outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and
corporate expenses. The payment of dividends by our insurance company
subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the
surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries, as well as the regulatory
restrictions. As a result, we may not be able to receive dividends from these
subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations or pay
dividends.



We may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and
even if we do, we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or
successfully invest in such ventures.

As part of our present strategy, we continue to evaluate possible
acquisition transactions and the start-up of complementary businesses on an
ongoing basis, and at any given time, we may be engaged in discussions with
respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance
ventures, that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable
terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful. The
process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures
may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.

We may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.

We depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriting
talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business. If
the quality of our underwriting team and other personnel decreases, we may be
unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets
in which we operate, and be unable to expand our operations into new markets.

ITEM  2.     PROPERTIES

W. R. Berkley and its subsidiaries own or lease office buildings or office
space suitable to conduct their operations. At December 31, 2002, the Company
had aggregate office space of 1,072,093 square feet, of which 394,410 was owned
and 677,682 was leased.

Rental expense was approximately $17,586,000, $18,021,000 and $16,580,000
for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Future minimum lease payments (without
provision for sublease income) are $13,797,000 in 2003; $9,984,000 in 2004;
$7,693,000 in 2005; and $21,956,000 thereafter.

ITEM  3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company’s subsidiaries are regularly engaged in the defense of claims
arising out of the conduct of the insurance business. The Company does not
believe that such litigation, individually or in the aggregate, will have a
material effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

A subsidiary of the Company has a pending arbitration proceeding
pertaining to the interpretation of the contract terms in two reinsurance
agreements. The arbitration was demanded in April 2002, and a hearing is
presently scheduled for the third quarter of 2003. Each party is seeking to
have its interpretation of the contract terms prevail. As of December 31, 2002,
the reinsurer’s interpretation of the contract terms would reduce the Company’s
recoverable from the reinsurer by $4 million for paid losses and $46 million
for unpaid losses. Although the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be
determined, management believes that the Company’s interpretation of this
contract is correct and intends to vigorously pursue this matter in
arbitration.

There are two pending arbitrations pertaining to reinsurance contract
coverage issues where a subsidiary of the Company is the assuming reinsurer.
One such arbitration was demanded by the ceding company in January 2002, and
the other was demanded by the ceding company in April 2002. Hearings in both
arbitrations are presently scheduled during the second quarter of 2003. In each
instance, the relief sought is a determination of the coverage issue involved.
The Company’s estimates of the cost of settling its insurance and reinsurance
claims, including claims in arbitrations and litigation, are reflected in its
aggregate reserves for losses and loss expenses. Accordingly, based on
currently available information, the Company believes that the resolution of
these two pending arbitrations will not have a material effect on its financial
condition or results of operations. However, if these two arbitrations are
decided adversely to the Company, the Company’s potential exposure, in excess
of the amounts reserved, is up to $16 million, after tax.

ITEM  4.     SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted during the fourth quarter of 2002 to a vote of
holders of the Company’s Common Stock.
