We describe these risks and uncertainties in greater detail below under the caption “Certain
factors that may affect future results.” These risks and uncertainties could cause our actual

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

W. R. Berkley Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is an insurance holding company which,
through its subsidiaries, operates in five segments of the property casualty insurance business:

Our holding company structure provides us with the flexibility to respond to local or specific
market conditions and to pursue specialty business niches. It also allows us to be closer to our
customers in order to better understand their individual needs and risk characteristics. Our
structure allows us to capitalize on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized
capital, investment and reinsurance management and actuarial, financial and corporate legal staff
support.

Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this Form 10-K to “W. R. Berkley,” “we,” “us,”
“our,” the “Company” or similar terms refer to W. R. Berkley Corporation together with its
subsidiaries.

Our specialty insurance and reinsurance operations are conducted nationwide, as well as in the
United Kingdom. Regional insurance operations are conducted primarily in the Midwest, New England,
Southern (excluding Florida) and Mid Atlantic regions of the United States. Alternative markets
operations are conducted throughout the U.S. International operations are conducted in Argentina
and the Philippines.

Net premiums written, as reported based on United States generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”), for each of the past five years were as follows:

The following sections briefly describe our insurance segments. All of the domestic insurance
subsidiaries except Admiral Insurance Company have an A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”) rating
of “A (Excellent)” which is the third highest rating out of 15 possible ratings by A. M. Best.
Admiral Insurance Company has a rating of “A+ (Superior)” which is A.M. Best’s second highest
rating. W. R. Berkley Insurance (Europe), Limited has a rating of “A- (Excellent)” which is A.M.
Best’s fourth highest rating. A.M. Best’s ratings are based upon factors of concern to
policyholders, insurance agents and brokers and are not directed toward the protection of
investors. A.M. Best states: “While Best’s ratings reflect [its] opinion of a company’s financial
strength and ability to meet its ongoing obligations to policyholders, they are not a warranty, nor
are they a recommendation of specific policy form, contract, rate or claim practice.” A.M. Best
reviews its ratings on a periodic basis, and ratings of the Company’s subsidiaries are therefore
subject to change.

SPECIALTY INSURANCE

Our specialty segment underwrites complex and sophisticated third-party liability risks,
principally within excess and surplus lines. Excess and surplus lines differ from standard market
lines in that excess and surplus lines are generally free of rate and form regulation and provide
coverage for more complex and hard-to-place risks. The primary specialty lines of business are
premises operations, professional liability, commercial automobile, products liability and property
lines. The specialty business is conducted through nine operating units. The companies within the
segment are divided along the different customer bases and product lines that they serve. The
specialty units deliver their products through a variety of distribution channels depending on the
customer base and particular risks insured. The customers in this segment are highly diverse.

Admiral Insurance Company

(“Admiral”) provides excess and surplus lines coverage that
generally involves a moderate to high degrees of risk due to the nature of the class of coverage
(e.g., products liability) or insured entity (e.g., fireworks distributors). Admiral concentrates
on commercial casualty, professional liability, umbrella and commercial property lines of business
produced by wholesale brokers. Admiral’s average annual premiums per policy were approximately
$45,000 in 2004.

Nautilus Insurance Company

(“Nautilus”) insures excess and surplus risks that are less
complex and involve a lower degree of expected severity than those covered by Admiral. A
substantial portion of Nautilus’ business is written on a binding authority basis, subject to
certain contractual limitations. Nautilus’ average annual premiums per policy were approximately
$4,000 in 2004.

Carolina Casualty Insurance Company

(“Carolina”) specializes in transportation
insurance for long-haul trucking and public automobile risks, operating as an admitted carrier in
all states.

Monitor Liability Managers, Inc.

(“Monitor”) specializes in professional liability
insurance, including directors’ and officers’ liability, employment practices liability, lawyers’
professional liability, management liability and non-profit directors’ and officers’ liability.

Vela Insurance Services, LLC

(“Vela”) provides excess and surplus lines coverage to
small and medium size accounts with a primary focus on contractors and products liability. Vela’s
average annual premiums per policy were approximately $52,000 in 2004.

W. R. Berkley Insurance (Europe), Limited

(“Berkley UK”) is a United Kingdom
authorized insurance company that began operations in July 2003. Berkley UK writes professional
indemnity, directors & officers and general liability business.

Berkley Specialty Underwriting Managers, LLC

(“Berkley Specialty”) is an underwriting
company formed in 2004 to provide excess and surplus lines general liability coverage to the
wholesale market. It also plans to offer commercial property and casualty insurance products to
the entertainment and sports industry.

including workers’ compensation, for luxury condominium, cooperative and rental apartment buildings

REGIONAL

Our regional subsidiaries provide commercial insurance products to customers primarily in 27
states. Key clients of this segment are small-to-mid-sized businesses and state and local
governmental entities. The regional subsidiaries are organized geographically, which provides them
with the flexibility to adapt to local market conditions, while enjoying the superior
administrative capabilities and financial strength of W. R. Berkley. The regional operations are
conducted through four geographic regions based on markets served: Continental Western Insurance
Group (“Continental Western Group”) in the Midwest, Acadia Insurance Company (“Acadia”) in New
England, Union Standard Insurance Group (“Union Standard”)
in the South (excluding Florida), and
Berkley Mid Atlantic Group in the Mid Atlantic region. In addition, surety bonds are offered
nationwide through a separate regional company, Monitor Surety Managers, Inc. (“Monitor Surety”).

The regional subsidiaries primarily sell insurance products through a network of non-exclusive
independent agents who are compensated on a commission basis. Our regional companies underwrite
all major commercial lines.

Our alternative markets operations specialize in developing, insuring, reinsuring and
administering self-insurance programs and other alternative risk transfer mechanisms. Our clients
include employers, employer groups, insurers, and alternative market funds seeking less costly,
more efficient ways to manage exposure to risks. In addition to providing insurance, the
alternative markets segment also provides a wide variety of fee-based services, including
consulting and administrative services.



Each of our alternative markets operating units is involved in risk management and is
organized according to one of the following product areas: insuring excess workers’ compensation
risks; insuring primary workers’ compensation risks; and providing non-risk bearing services.

Midwest Employers Casualty Company

(“MECC”) operates on a nationwide basis and
provides excess workers’ compensation coverage and risk management
services to self-insured employers and groups above their self-insured or retained limits.

Preferred Employers Insurance Company

(“Preferred Employers”) offers primary

REINSURANCE

Our reinsurance operations consist of seven operating units, which specialize in underwriting
property casualty reinsurance on both a treaty and a facultative basis on behalf of Berkley
Insurance Company. Treaty reinsurance is the reinsurance of all or a specified portion or category
of risks underwritten by the ceding company during the term of the agreement. Facultative
reinsurance is the reinsurance of individual risks whereby a reinsurer generally has the
opportunity to analyze and separately underwrite a risk prior to agreeing to be bound.

Signet Star Re, LLC

(“Signet Star”) focuses on specialty lines of business, including
professional liability, umbrella, workers’ compensation, commercial automobile and trucking, where
knowledge and expertise in a specific area is valued over the capital scale of the reinsurance
provider. Signet Star emphasizes casualty excess of loss treaties and seeks significant
participations in order to have greater influence over the terms and conditions of coverage.
Signet Star business is produced through reinsurance brokers or intermediaries as opposed to direct
relationships with the ceding companies.

Facultative ReSources, Inc.

(“Fac Re”) specializes in individual certificate and
program facultative business developed through brokers. Its experienced underwriters seek to
offset the underwriting and pricing cycles in the underlying insurance business by working closely
with ceding company clients to develop appropriate underwriting criteria and through superior risk
selection.

Lloyd’s of London Reinsurance

(“Lloyd’s”) represents quota share reinsurance contracts
with MAP Capital Limited and Kiln plc. Map Capital Limited and Kiln PLC underwrite a broad range
of mainly short-tail classes of business on a worldwide basis.

Berkley Underwriting Partners, LLC

(“Berkley Underwriting Partners”) writes specialty
insurance products through program administrators and managing general underwriters.

B F Re Underwriting, LLC.

(“BF Re”), which commenced operations in 2002, writes
facultative reinsurance on a direct basis.

Fidelity & Surety Reinsurance Managers, LLC

(“Fidelity and Surety”) offers reinsurance
coverage to a limited number of regional fidelity and surety accounts.

Berkley Risk Solutions

(“Berkley Risk Solutions”) was formed in 2003, and in 2004
began to provide insurance and reinsurance-based financial solutions to insurance companies and
self-insured entities.

INTERNATIONAL

The Company and Northwestern Mutual Life International, Inc. (“NML”), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, jointly own Berkley International,
LLC (“Berkley International”).

Applying the same approach that we take for our domestic businesses, we believe that
decentralized control is key to the success of our international efforts. For example, we hire
local insurance executives who have specialized knowledge of their customers, markets and products,
and we link their compensation to meeting performance objectives.

International operations are conducted in Argentina and the Philippines. In Argentina, we
offer commercial and personal property casualty insurance. Our Argentina subsidiary ceased writing
new life insurance business in 2002. In the Philippines, we provide savings and life products to
customers.

DISCONTINUED BUSINESS

In 2001, the Company discontinued its domestic personal lines business,
both homeowners and private passenger automobile, and the alternative markets division of its
reinsurance segment, by not renewing existing policies or treaties and ceasing to write new
business. Although the Company discontinued the alternative market division of its reinsurance
segment, it continues to write insurance and reinsurance covering workers’ compensation for
self-insured entities within the alternative markets segment .

The
following table set forth the percentages of net premiums written for our discontinued business:

Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves

To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, either known or unknown, insurers establish
reserves, which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay
claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred. Estimates and
assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective
judgments, often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and
actuarial measurements. Such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of
time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the report of the loss to the insurer,
the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss.

In general, when a claim is reported, claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the
estimated amount of the ultimate payment. The estimate represents an informed judgment based on
general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel
regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim. Reserves are also established on an
aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not yet reported to the insurer, potential
inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims, including legal and
other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process. Reserves are
established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided.



In examining reserve adequacy, several factors are considered in addition to the economic
value of losses. These factors include historical data, legal developments, changes in social
attitudes and economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. The actuarial process
relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted judgmentally for the effects of
current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future
outcomes. Reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments
using currently available data. As additional experience and other data become available and are
reviewed, these estimates and judgments may be revised. This may result in reserve increases or
decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions
are changed.

Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an
estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost.
While the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time, some of the major
assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation.
These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management’s
assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of future trends in claims
severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors, including the actions of
third parties which are beyond the Company’s control. These variables are affected by internal and
external events, such as inflation and economic volatility, judicial and litigation trends,
reinsurance coverage and legislative changes, which make it more difficult to accurately predict
claim costs. The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of
liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is
made. Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain, the Company cannot assure that its current
reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.

We discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’
compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which
losses are paid. Discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income
earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities. The expected losses and loss expense
payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the Company’s loss payout experience and is
supplemented with data compiled from insurance companies writing similar business. The liabilities
for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using risk-free discount rates determined by
reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for non-proportional business, and at the statutory rate
for proportional business. The discount rates range from 3.5% to 6.5% with a weighted average rate
of 4.8%. The aggregate net discount, after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance, is
$502,874,000, $393,152,000 and $292,697,000 at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
increase in the aggregate discount from 2003 to 2004 and from 2002 to 2003 resulted from the
increase in workers’ compensation reserves.

To date, known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have
not had a material impact on our operations. Environmental claims have not materially impacted us
because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which are
subject to significant environmental exposures.

Our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and
environmental claims were $38,258,000 and $31,866,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The Company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and
environmental claims were $54,971,000 and $49,283,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were
approximately $9,194,000, $4,749,000 and $6,652,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net paid
losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately
$2,802,000, $1,391,000 and $2,938,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The estimation of
these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because
it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of
a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential affect of
significant unresolved legal matters, including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating
the legal issues. Additionally, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of
such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain.

The following table presents the development of net reserves for 1994 through 2004. The top
line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the
balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This represents the estimated amount of losses
and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date,
including losses that had been incurred but not yet reported to us. The upper portion of the table
shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end
of each succeeding year. The estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency
and severity of claims for individual years.

The “cumulative redundancy (deficiency)” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over
all prior years. For example, the 1994 reserves have developed a $170 million redundancy over ten
years. That amount has been reflected in income over the ten years. The impact on the results of
operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation
tables above. It should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves,
rather than accident or policy year loss development. Therefore, each amount in the table includes
the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years. For example, assume a claim that occurred
in 1994 is reserved for $2,000 as of December 31, 1994. Assuming this claim estimate was changed in
2004 to $2,300, and was settled for $2,300 in 2004, the $300 deficiency would appear as a
deficiency in each year from 1994 through 2003.

Reinsurance

We follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying
to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies that we write. Reinsurance is
purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against
catastrophic losses. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary
liability for the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the
insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage. We monitor the financial condition of our
reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial, financially sound carriers.
As a result, generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an A.M. Best
rating of “A (Excellent)” or better with $500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers
who cover our property insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “A-(Excellent)” or better with
$250 million in policyholder surplus. As a result of the attacks of September 11, 2001, many
reinsurers have significantly changed their underwriting guidelines, and limit or no longer provide
terrorism coverage. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of
Operations” and Note 9 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Regulation

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the
jurisdictions in which they do business, and the Company believes that it is in compliance in all
material respects with such regulations. They are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory,
supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners. This regulation relates to
such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; the licensing of
insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; deposits of securities for
the benefit of policyholders; approval of policy forms and premium rates; periodic examination of
the affairs of insurance companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial
condition of insurers or for other purposes; establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned
premiums and losses; and requirements regarding numerous other matters. Our property casualty
subsidiaries, other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries, must generally file all
rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate. Our excess and surplus and
reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation.

In addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries, we are subject to state
statutes governing insurance holding company systems. Typically, such statutes require that we
periodically file information with the state insurance commissioner, including information
concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations.
Under the terms of applicable state statutes, any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a
specified percentage (commonly 10%) of our outstanding voting securities would be required to
obtain regulatory approval of the purchase. Under Florida law, which is applicable to us due to



our ownership of Carolina Casualty Insurance Company, a Florida domiciled insurer, the
acquisition of more than 5% of our capital stock must receive regulatory approval. Further, state
insurance statutes typically place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions
payable by insurance companies in order to protect their solvency. See “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Various state and federal organizations, including Congressional committees and the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), have been conducting reviews into various aspects
of the insurance business. No assurance can be given that future legislative or
regulatory changes resulting from such activity will not adversely affect our insurance
subsidiaries.

The NAIC utilizes a Risk Based Capital (RBC) formula that is designed to measure the adequacy
of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. The RBC
formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain
factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. The RBC Model Law provides for four
incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC
target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan
for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The RBC of each of
our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized RBC control level as of December 31,
2004.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (the “Act”), was
enacted in 1999 and significantly affects the financial services industry, including insurance
companies, banks and securities firms. The Act modifies federal law to permit the creation of
financial holding companies, which, as regulated by the Act, can maintain cross-holdings in
insurance companies, banks and securities firms to an extent not previously allowed. The Act also
permits or facilitates certain types of combinations or affiliations for financial holding
companies. The Act establishes a functional regulatory scheme under which state insurance
departments will maintain primary regulation over insurance activities, subject to provisions for
certain federal preemptions.

Our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an
insurer in that jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are
available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants. The protection afforded
under a state’s guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state.
Generally, all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund, and
assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums. The NAIC Model
Post-Assessment Guaranty Fund Act, which many states have adopted, limits assessments to an insurer
to 2% of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting. Likewise,
several states (or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to
be members) have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business.

We receive funds from our insurance subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees
for certain management services. Annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state
statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which
an insurance subsidiary is domiciled.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (“TRIA”) became effective November 26, 2002. TRIA
establishes a temporary Federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private
compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. The program is scheduled to
terminate on December 31, 2005. TRIA is applicable to almost all commercial lines of property and
casualty insurance. Insurers with direct commercial property and casualty insurance exposure in the
United States are required to participate in the program and make available coverage for certified
acts of terrorism. Federal participation will be triggered under TRIA when the Secretary of
Treasury certifies an act of terrorism. Under the program the federal government will pay 90% of
an insurer’s losses in excess of the insurer’s applicable deductible. The insurer’s deductible is
based on a percent of earned premium for covered lines of commercial property and casualty
insurance: for 2004 it was 10% of 2003 premium and for 2005 it is 15% of 2004 premium. Based on
our 2004 earned premiums, our deductible under TRIA during 2005 will increase to approximately $517
million. TRIA limits the federal governments share of losses at $100 billion for a program year.
In addition, an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not liable for the payment of losses
in excess of the $100 billion cap. After December 31, 2005, there will not be a Federal program
available for terrorism losses, unless TRIA is extended or replaced. At such time, the Company
will have the option to exclude terrorism losses from coverage, except for any lines of insurance
or jurisdictions where exclusions were not permitted before TRIA was enacted.



The insurance industry recently has become the subject of increasing scrutiny with respect to
insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices. The New York State
Attorney General and other state and federal regulators have commenced investigations and other
proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of
insurance products, and unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or
the purchaser. The practices currently under investigation include, among other things,
allegations that so-called contingent commission arrangements may conflict with a broker’s duties
to its customers and that certain brokers and insurers may have engaged in anti-competitive
practices in connection with insurance premium quotes. The New York State Attorney General has
recently entered into settlement agreements with two large insurance brokers against whom civil
complaints had been filed. These investigations and proceedings are expected to continue, and new
investigative proceedings may be commenced, in the future. These investigations and proceedings
could result in legal precedents and new industry-wide practices or legislation, rules or
regulations that could significantly affect the insurance industry.

Competition

The property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are competitive, with over 2,000
insurance companies transacting business in the United States. We compete directly with a large
number of these companies. Our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized
areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by
responding quickly to changing market conditions. Our subsidiaries establish their own pricing
practices. Such practices are based upon a Company-wide philosophy to price products with the
general intent of making an underwriting profit. Competition in the industry generally changes with
profitability.

Competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes from other specialty
insurers, regional carriers, large national multi-line companies and reinsurers. Under certain
market conditions, standard carriers also compete for excess and surplus business.

Competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers, which
produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market. These competitors
include Berkshire Hathaway, GE Insurance Solutions, Transatlantic Reinsurance and Everest
Reinsurance, which collectively comprise a majority of the property casualty reinsurance market in
the United States.

The regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual and other regional stock
companies as well as national carriers. Direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with
the regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their salaried employees, generally at a
lower cost than through independent agents such as those used by the Company.

The international operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small,
which may be related to government entities, as well as with branch or local subsidiaries of
multinational companies.

Employees

As of February 28, 2005, we employed 4,736 persons. Of this number, our subsidiaries employed
4,671 persons, of whom 2,709 were executive and administrative
personnel and 1,962 were clerical
personnel. We employed the remaining 65 persons at the parent company and in investment operations,
of whom 49 were executive and administrative personnel and 16 were clerical personnel.

Other Information about the Company’s business

We maintain an interest in the acquisition or start up of complementary businesses and
continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis. In addition, the
insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds.

Seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses
sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. Although the effect on our business of
such catastrophes as tornadoes, hurricanes, hailstorms, earthquakes and terrorist acts may be
mitigated by reinsurance, they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one
or more reporting periods.



We have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues.

Compliance by W. R. Berkley and its subsidiaries with federal, state and local provisions that
have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or
otherwise relating to protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

Our business faces significant risks. If any of the events or circumstances described as
risks below actually occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be
materially and adversely affected.

Risks Relating to Our Industry

Our results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance
and reinsurance industry.

The results of companies in the property casualty insurance industry historically have been
subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties. The demand for insurance is influenced
primarily by general economic conditions, while the supply of insurance is directly related to
available capacity. The adequacy of premium rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency
of claims, which are influenced by many factors, including natural disasters, regulatory measures
and court decisions that define and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic
inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or losses. In addition, investment rates
of return may impact policy rates. These factors can have a significant impact on ultimate
profitability because a property casualty insurance policy is priced before its costs are known, as
premiums usually are determined long before claims are reported. These factors could produce
results that would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, which may require us to establish
additional reserves.

Our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were approximately $5.4 billion as of December
31, 2004. Our loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling all claims and
related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred.

Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an
estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for
claims that have occurred, whether known or unknown. The major assumptions about anticipated loss
emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. These estimates, which generally
involve actuarial projections, are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then
known, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency, inflation, judicial
theories of liability, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and other factors, including the
actions of third parties which are beyond our control.

The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of
liabilities, where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is
made and settlement is reached. In periods with increased economic volatility, it becomes more
difficult to accurately predict claim costs. Reserve estimates are continually refined in an
ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. Adjustments to
reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed. Because
setting reserves is inherently uncertain, we cannot assure you that our current reserves will prove
adequate in light of subsequent events. Should we need to increase our reserves, our pre-tax income
for the period would decrease by a corresponding amount.

We
increased our estimates for claims occurring in prior years by
$295 million in 2004, $245
million in 2003 and $156 million in 2002. We, along with the property casualty insurance industry
in general, have experienced higher than expected losses for certain types of business written from
1998 to 2001. Although our reserves reflect our best estimate of the costs of settling claims, we
cannot assure you that our claim estimates will not need to be increased in the future.

We discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers’ compensation business because of the
long period of time over which losses are paid. Discounting is intended to appropriately match
losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting liabilities. The
expected loss and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from our loss
payout experience and is supplemented with data compiled from insurance companies writing similar
business. Changes in the loss and loss expense payout pattern are recorded in the period they are
determined. If the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated, the discount will be
reduced and pre-tax income will decrease by a corresponding amount.



As a property casualty insurer, we face losses from natural and man-made catastrophes.

Property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a
significant effect on their results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Catastrophe
losses have had a significant impact on our results. In addition, through our recent quota share
arrangements with certain Lloyd’s syndicates, we have additional exposure to catastrophic losses.
For example, weather-related losses were $29 million in 2002, $38 million in 2003 and $60 million
in 2004.

Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes,
hailstorms, explosions, severe winter weather and fires, as well as terrorist activities. The
incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a
catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the
event and the severity of the event. Some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas;
however, hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in large, heavily populated
areas. Catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property casualty lines, and most of our
past catastrophe-related claims have resulted from severe storms. Seasonal weather variations may
affect the severity and frequency of our losses. Insurance companies are not permitted to reserve
for a catastrophe until it has occurred. It is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or
multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition.

We face significant competitive pressures in our businesses, which may reduce premium rates and
prevent us from pricing our products at attractive rates.

We compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business. We
compete, and will continue to compete, with major U.S. and non-U.S. insurers and reinsurers, other
regional companies, as well as mutual companies, specialty insurance companies, underwriting
agencies and diversified financial services companies. Competition in our businesses is based on
many factors, including the perceived financial strength of the company, premium charges, other
terms and conditions offered, services provided, commissions paid to producers, ratings assigned by
independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to
be written.

Some of our competitors, particularly in the reinsurance business, have greater financial and
marketing resources than we do. These competitors within the reinsurance segment include Berkshire
Hathaway, GE Insurance Solutions, Transatlantic Reinsurance and Everest Reinsurance Company, which
collectively comprise a majority of the U.S. property casualty reinsurance market. We expect that
perceived financial strength, in particular, will become more important as customers seek high
quality reinsurers. Certain of our competitors operate from tax advantaged jurisdictions and have
the ability to offer lower rates due to such tax advantages.

New competition could cause the supply and/or demand for insurance or reinsurance to change,
which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates.

We, as a primary insurer, may have significant exposure for terrorist acts.

To the extent that reinsurers have excluded coverage for terrorist acts or have priced such
coverage at rates that we believe are not practical, we, in our capacity as a primary insurer, do
not have reinsurance protection and are exposed for potential losses as a result of any terrorist
acts. For example, our losses from the World Trade Center attack in 2001 were $35 million. We
have particular exposure to terrorist acts as a provider of insurance for habitational risks in the
New York metropolitan area and as a workers’ compensation insurer.

To the extent an act of terrorism is certified by the Secretary of Treasury, we may be covered
under The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (“TRIA”) for up to 90% of our losses. However, any
such coverage would be subject to a mandatory deductible based on a percent of earned premium for
the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance. Based on our 2004 earned
premiums, our deductible under TRIA during 2005 will increase to approximately $517 million. If
TRIA is not extended beyond its stated termination date of December 31, 2005 or replaced by a
similar program, our liability for terrorist acts could be a material amount. In addition, even
this coverage provided under TRIA does not apply to reinsurance that we write.



We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which increases our costs and could restrict
the conduct of our business.

We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision. Most insurance
regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and
other investors. This system of regulation, generally administered by a department of insurance in
each state in which we do business, relates to, among other things:

State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance
companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of
insurance companies, holding company issues and other matters. Recently adopted federal financial
services modernization legislation may lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance
industry in the coming years. Also, foreign governments regulate our international operations.

The insurance industry recently has become the subject of increasing scrutiny with respect to
insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales practices. The New York State
Attorney General and other state and federal regulators have commenced investigations and other
proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements between producers and issuers of
insurance products, and unsuitable sales practices by producers on behalf of either the issuer or
the purchaser. The practices currently under investigation include, among other things,
allegations that so-called contingent commission arrangements may conflict with a broker’s duties
to its customers and that certain brokers and insurers may have engaged in anti-competitive
practices in connection with insurance premium quotes. The New York State Attorney General has
recently entered into settlement agreements with two large insurance brokers against whom civil
complaints had been filed. These investigations and proceedings are expected to continue, and new
investigative proceedings may be commenced, in the future. These investigations and proceedings
could result in legal precedents and new industry-wide practices or legislation, rules or
regulations that could significantly affect the insurance industry.

We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not
fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s
interpretation of the laws and regulations. Also, some regulatory authorities have relatively
broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the requisite
licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance
regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our
activities or monetarily penalize us. Also, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance
industry, whether federal, state or foreign, or changes in laws or regulations themselves or
interpretations by regulatory authorities, restrict the conduct of our business.

In certain of our insurance businesses, the rates we charge our policyholders are subject to
regulatory approval. Certain lines of business are subject to a greater degree of regulatory
scrutiny then others. For example, the workers’ compensation business is highly regulated. During
2004, approximately 13% of our net premiums written represented primary workers’ compensation
business. Of our net premiums written, approximately 5% represented primary workers’ compensation
business written in the State of California, which is undergoing workers’ compensation reform that
may adversely affect our ability to adjust rates.

Risks Relating to Our Business

We cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion, if at all, and, as a result,
we could experience losses.

We purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we have assumed, known as
ceding, to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with
the risk. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is
transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us, the reinsured, of our liability to



our policyholders. Our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to
us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with
respect to our reinsurers, and if our reinsurers fail to pay us, our financial results would be
adversely affected. Underwriting results and investment returns of some of our reinsurers may
affect their future ability to pay claims. As of December 31, 2004, the amount due from our
reinsurers was $851 million, including amounts due from state funds and industry pools. Certain of
these amounts due from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or held in trust on our behalf.

We are rated by A.M. Best and Standard & Poor’s, and a decline in these ratings could affect our
standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease.

Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position
of insurance companies. Certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best,
Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Services. A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s ratings
reflect their opinions of an insurance company’s financial strength, operating performance,
strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders, are not evaluations
directed to investors and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Our ratings
are subject to periodic review, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain those
ratings. All of the domestic insurance subsidiaries except Admiral Insurance Company have an A.M.
Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”) rating of “A (Excellent)” which is the third highest rating out of
15 possible ratings by A. M. Best. Admiral Insurance Company has a rating of “A+ (Superior)” which
is A.M. Best’s second highest rating. W. R. Berkley Insurance (Europe), Limited has a rating of
“A- (Excellent)” which is A.M. Best’s fourth highest rating. The Standard & Poor’s financial
strength rating for our insurance subsidiaries is A+/negative (the seventh highest rating out of
twenty-seven possible ratings). Our Moody’s rating is A2 for Berkley Insurance Company (the sixth
highest rating out of twenty-one possible ratings).

If our ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s or
Moody’s, our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and it would be more
difficult for us to market our products. A significant downgrade could result in a substantial
loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with higher claims-paying and financial
strength ratings.

If market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable, we may be required to bear
increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.

As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for
certain amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries, especially catastrophe
risks. We also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by others which we reinsure. Market
conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we
purchase, which may affect the level of our business and profitability. Our reinsurance facilities
are generally subject to annual renewal. We may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance
facilities or to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates.
If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either
our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, we
would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, especially catastrophe exposed
risks.

Our international operations expose us to investment, political and economic risks.

Our international operations, including our recent UK-based operations, expose us to
investment, political and economic risks, including foreign currency and credit risk. Changes in
the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. For example, Argentina has recently experienced
substantial political and economic problems, including debt restructuring and the devaluation of
the Argentinean peso. As a result, we recorded a charge of $18 million in 2001 and $10 million in
2002 to recognize other than temporary impairment of our investment in Argentine bonds.

We may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures and even if we do, we may
not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such ventures.

As part of our present strategy, we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and
the start-up of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis, and at any given time, we may be
engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures, that
such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our



future acquisitions or ventures will be successful. The process of integrating any companies
we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.

We may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.

We depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriting talent and other
skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business. If the quality of our underwriting
team and other personnel decreases, we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position
in the specialized markets in which we operate, and be unable to expand our operations into new
markets.

Risks Relating to Our Investments

A significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed income securities and is subject to market
fluctuations.

Our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed income securities. As of December
31, 2004, our investment in fixed income securities was approximately $6.4 billion, or 76% of our
total investment portfolio.

The fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate
depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair market value of fixed income
securities generally decreases as interest rates rise. Conversely, if interest rates decline,
investment income earned from future investments in fixed income securities will be lower. In
addition, some fixed income securities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities,
carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations. Based upon the composition and
duration of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2004, a 100 basis point increase in interest
rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments of approximately $258
million.

The value of investments in fixed income securities, and particularly our investments in
high-yield securities, is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit
worthiness of the issuer. Although we attempt to manage this risk by diversifying our portfolio
and emphasizing preservation of principal, our investments are subject to losses as a result of a
general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest, as
well as risks inherent in particular securities. For example, we reported provisions for other
than temporary impairments in the value of our fixed income investments of $16 million in 2002 and
$430,000 in 2003.

We invest some of our assets in equity securities, including merger arbitrage investments and real
estate securities, which may decline in value.

We invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities, including merger
arbitrage investments and investments in affiliates. At December 31, 2004, our investments in
equity securities were approximately $934 million, or 11% of our investment portfolio. Although we
did not report any provisions for “other than temporary impairments” in the value of our equity
securities in 2003, we reported such provisions in the amounts of $2.7 million in 2002 and $2.8
million in 2004.

Merger and convertible arbitrage trading represented 38% of our equity securities at December
31, 2004. Merger arbitrage is the business of investing in the securities of publicly held
companies that are the targets in announced tender offers and mergers. Merger arbitrage differs
from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and events believed likely to bring
about a change in value over a relatively short time period, usually four months or less. Our merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated with the completion of announced deals,
which are subject to regulatory as well as political and other risks. As a result of the reduced
activity in the merger and acquisitions area, we may not be able achieve the returns that we have
enjoyed in the past.

Included in our equity security portfolio are investments in publicly traded real estate
investment trusts (“REITs”) and private real estate investment funds, real estate limited
partnerships and venture capital investments

.

At December 31, 2004, our investments in these
securities were approximately $311 million, or 30% of our equity portfolio. The values of our real
estate investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in the economy in general and real
estate valuations in particular. In addition, the real estate investment funds, limited
partnerships, and venture capital investments in which we invest are less liquid than our other
investments.



Risks Relating to Purchasing Our Securities

We
are an insurance holding company and may not be able to receive dividends in needed
amounts.

As
an insurance holding company, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries.
We have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for
paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to
stockholders and corporate expenses. The payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory
restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries, as well as
the regulatory restrictions. During 2005, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without
regulatory approval is approximately $270 million. As a result, in the future we may not be able
to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our
obligations or pay dividends.

We are subject to certain provisions that may have the effect of hindering, delaying or preventing
third party takeovers, which may prevent our shareholders from receiving premium prices for their
shares in an unsolicited takeover and make it more difficult for third parties to replace our
current management.

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as well as our rights agreement
and state insurance statutes, may hinder, delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of
our control. These provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third
parties to cause the replacement of our current management without the concurrence of our board of
directors.

These provisions include:

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

W. R. Berkley and its subsidiaries own or lease office buildings or office space suitable to
conduct their operations. At December 31, 2004, the Company had aggregate office space of
1,450,722 square feet, of which 549,638 were owned and 901,084 were leased.

Rental expense was approximately $16,783,000, $18,773,000 and $17,586,000 for 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Future minimum lease payments (without provision for sublease income) are
$15,889,000 in 2005; $13,747,000 in 2006; and $41,783,000 thereafter.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company’s subsidiaries are subject to disputes, including litigation and arbitration,
arising in the ordinary course of their insurance and reinsurance businesses. The Company’s
estimates of the costs of settling such matters are reflected in its aggregate reserves for losses
and loss expenses, and the Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of such matters will
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.



The New York State Attorney General and other regulators have commenced investigations, legal
actions and general inquiries concerning producer compensation and alleged anti-competitive
activities in the insurance industry. Certain allegations include improper sales practices by
insurance producers as well as other non-competitive behaviors. The Company and certain of its
operating units, like many others in the insurance industry, have received information requests
from various state insurance regulators and other state authorities. These requests, for the most
part, relate to inquiries into inappropriate solicitation activities, producer compensation
practices and the underwriting of legal malpractice insurance. The Company is responding to each of
these inquiries and is cooperating with the applicable regulatory authorities. In this regard, the
Company commenced an internal review with the assistance of outside counsel. The internal review,
which is substantially complete, focused on the Company’s relationships with its distribution
channels. As a result of the investigation, a single insurance operating unit reported certain
limited instances of conduct that could be characterized as involving inappropriate solicitation
practices. To address these limited instances, the Company has implemented certain additional
internal procedures and is taking other corrective action.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted during the fourth quarter of 2004 to a vote of holders of the
