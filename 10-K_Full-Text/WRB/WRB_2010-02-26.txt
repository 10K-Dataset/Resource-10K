SAFE
    HARBOR STATEMENT

UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

This is a “Safe Harbor” Statement under the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This document may
    contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Some of the
    forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of
    forward-looking words such as “believes,”
    “expects,” “potential,”
    “continued,” “may,” “will,”
    “should,” “seeks,”
    “approximately,” “predicts,”
    “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,”
    “anticipates” or the negative version of those words
    or other comparable words. Any forward-looking statements
    contained herein including statements related to our outlook for
    the industry and for our performance for the year 2010 and
    beyond, are based upon our historical performance and on current
    plans, estimates and expectations. The inclusion of this
    forward-looking information should not be regarded as a
    representation by us that the future plans, estimates or
    expectations contemplated by us will be achieved. They are
    subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not
    limited to:

•

the cyclical nature of the property casualty industry;

•

the long-tail and potentially volatile nature of the insurance
    and reinsurance business;

•

product demand and pricing;

•

claims development and the process of estimating reserves;

•

investment risks, including those of our portfolio of fixed
    maturity securities and investments in equity securities,
    including investments in financial institutions, municipal
    bonds, mortgage-backed securities, loans receivable, investment
    funds, merger arbitrage and private equity investments;

•

the impact of significant competition;

•

the potential impact of the economic downturn, and any
    legislative, regulatory, accounting or other initiatives taken
    in response to it, on our results and financial condition.

•

the uncertain nature of damage theories and loss amounts;

•

natural and man-made catastrophic losses, including as a result
    of terrorist activities;

•

the success of our new ventures or acquisitions and the
    availability of other opportunities;

•

the availability of reinsurance;

•

our retention under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Programs
    Reauthorization Act of 2007;

•

the ability of our reinsurers to pay reinsurance recoverables
    owed to us;

•

foreign currency and political risks relating to our
    international operations;

•

other legislative and regulatory developments, including those
    related to business practices in the insurance industry;

•

changes in the ratings assigned to us or our insurance company
    subsidiaries by rating agencies;

•

the availability of dividends from our insurance company
    subsidiaries;

•

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; and

•

other risks detailed in this

Form 10-K

and from time to time in our other filings with the Securities
    and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

We describe these risks and uncertainties in greater detail in
    Item 1A, Risk Factors. These risks and uncertainties could
    cause our actual results for the year 2010 and beyond to differ
    materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement
    we make. Any projections of growth in our net premiums written
    and management fees would not necessarily result in commensurate
    levels of underwriting and operating profits. Our future
    financial performance is dependent upon factors discussed
    elsewhere in this

Form 10-K

and our other SEC filings. Forward-looking statements speak only
    as of the date on which they are made.



PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

W. R. Berkley Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is an
    insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial
    lines writers in the United States and operates in five segments
    of the property casualty insurance business:

•

Specialty lines of insurance, including excess and surplus
    lines, premises operations, professional liability and
    commercial automobile

•

Regional commercial property casualty insurance

•

Alternative markets, including workers’ compensation and
    the management of self-insurance programs

•

Reinsurance, including treaty, facultative and Lloyd’s
    business

•

International

Our holding company structure provides us with the flexibility
    to respond to local or specific market conditions and to pursue
    specialty business niches. It also allows us to be closer to our
    customers in order to better understand their individual needs
    and risk characteristics. Our structure allows us to capitalize
    on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized
    capital, investment and reinsurance management, and actuarial,
    financial and corporate legal staff support. Since 2006, we have
    formed 18 new operating units to capitalize on various business
    opportunities.

Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this

Form 10-K

to “W. R. Berkley,” “we,” “us,”
    “our,” the “Company” or similar terms refer
    to W. R. Berkley Corporation together with its subsidiaries.

Our specialty insurance and reinsurance operations are conducted
    throughout the United States, and, on a limited basis, outside
    the United States. Regional insurance operations are conducted
    primarily in the Midwest, Northeast, Southern (excluding Florida
    and Louisiana), Mid Atlantic, and North Pacific regions of the
    United States. Alternative markets operations are conducted
    throughout the United States. Our international operations are
    conducted primarily in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe,
    South America, Australia, Southeast Asia and Canada.

The following sections describe our insurance segments and their
    operating units. These operating units underwrite on behalf of
    one or more affiliated insurance companies within the group
    pursuant to underwriting management agreements. Certain
    operating units are identified by us for descriptive purposes
    only and are not legal entities.

Twenty-four of our twenty-five insurance company subsidiaries
    rated by A.M. Best Company, Inc.
    (“A.M. Best”) have ratings of A+ (Superior) (the
    second highest rating our of 15 possible ratings) and one is
    rated A (Excellent) (the third highest rating).
    A.M. Best’s ratings are based upon factors of concern
    to policyholders, insurance agents and brokers and are not
    directed toward the protection of investors. A.M. Best
    states: “The Financial Strength Rating opinion addresses
    the relative ability of an insurer to meet its ongoing insurance
    obligations. The ratings are not assigned to specific insurance
    policies or contracts and do not address any other risk.”
    A.M. Best reviews its ratings on a periodic basis, and its
    ratings of the Company’s subsidiaries are therefore subject
    to change.

All of our twenty-three insurance company subsidiaries rated by
    Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) have
    financial strength ratings of A+ (the seventh highest rating out
    of twenty-seven possible ratings).

Our Moody’s ratings are A2 for Berkley Insurance Company,
    Berkley Regional Insurance Company and Admiral Insurance Company
    (the sixth highest rating out of twenty-one possible ratings).

SPECIALTY

Our specialty segment underwrites complex and sophisticated
    third-party liability risks, within excess and surplus lines and
    on an admitted basis. Excess and surplus lines differ from

    for more complex and

hard-to-place

risks. The specialty lines of business include premises
    operations, commercial automobile, property, products liability
    and professional liability lines. The specialty business is
    conducted through 18 operating units. The specialty units

ALTERNATIVE
    MARKETS

Our alternative markets operations specialize in insuring,
    reinsuring and administering self-insurance programs and other
    alternative risk transfer mechanisms. Our clients include
    commercial and governmental entity employers, employer groups,
    insurers, and other groups or entities seeking alternative ways
    to manage their exposure to risks. Often, alternative methods of
    risk management result in our customers choosing to retain more
    of this risk than they might otherwise retain in the traditional
    insurance market. In addition to providing insurance products,
    the alternative markets segment also provides a wide variety of
    fee-based services, including claims, administrative and
    consulting services.

    provides excess workers’ compensation coverage and risk
    management services to self-insured employers and groups as well

    includes large deductible and reinsurance programs.

Key Risk Insurance Company

    primary workers’ compensation insurance principally in the
    southeastern United States. Key Risk focuses on middle-market

REINSURANCE

Our reinsurance operations consist of five operating units,
    which specialize in underwriting property casualty reinsurance
    on both a treaty and a facultative basis on behalf of Berkley
    Insurance Company. Treaty reinsurance is the reinsurance of all
    or a specified portion or category of risks underwritten by the
    ceding company during the term of the agreement. Facultative
    reinsurance is the reinsurance of individual risks whereby a
    reinsurer generally has the opportunity to analyze and
    separately underwrite a risk prior to agreeing to be bound.

Signet Star Re, LLC

(“Signet Star”) focuses on
    underwriting specialty lines of business, including professional
    liability, umbrella, workers’ compensation, commercial
    automobile and trucking. Signet Star emphasizes casualty excess
    of loss treaties and seeks significant participations in order
    to have greater influence over the terms and conditions of
    coverage. Our treaty business is produced through reinsurance
    brokers or intermediaries.

Facultative ReSources, Inc.

(“Fac Re”)
    specializes in underwriting individual certificate and program
    facultative business developed through reinsurance brokers or
    intermediaries. Its experienced underwriters seek to offset the
    underwriting and pricing cycles in the underlying insurance
    business by working closely with ceding company clients to
    develop appropriate underwriting criteria and through superior
    risk selection.

Lloyd’s Reinsurance

(“Lloyd’s
    reinsurance”) represents a broad range of mainly short-tail
    classes of business, which are written through Lloyd’s of
    London.

B F Re Underwriters, LLC

(“BF Re”) is a
    facultative casualty reinsurance underwriting manager that
    serves clients through a nationwide network of regional offices.
    Its business is written directly with ceding companies. BF
    Re’s primary lines of business are professional liability,
    excess and surplus, umbrella and medical malpractice.

Berkley Risk Solutions, Inc.

(“Berkley Risk
    Solutions”) underwrites insurance and reinsurance-based
    financial coverages for insurance companies and self-insured
    entities.

Loss
    and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves

To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, either known or
    unknown, insurers establish reserves, which is a balance sheet
    account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay
    claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which
    have occurred. Estimates and assumptions relating to reserves
    for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective
    judgments, often including the interplay of specific
    uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial
    measurements. Such estimates are also susceptible to change as
    significant



periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured
    loss, the report of the loss to the insurer, the ultimate
    determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s
    payment of that loss.

In general, when a claim is reported, claims personnel establish
    a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the
    ultimate payment. The estimate represents an informed judgment
    based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience
    and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and
    value of the specific type of claim. Reserves are also
    established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred
    but not reported (“IBNR”) to the insurer, potential
    inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of
    settling claims, including legal and other fees and general
    expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process.
    Reserves are established based upon the then current legal
    interpretation of coverage provided.

In examining reserve adequacy, several factors are considered in
    addition to the economic value of losses. These factors include
    historical data, legal developments, changes in social attitudes
    and economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. The
    actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past
    experience, adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current
    developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for
    predicting future outcomes. Reserve amounts are necessarily
    based on management’s informed estimates and judgments
    using currently available data. As additional experience and
    other data become available and are reviewed, these estimates
    and judgments may be revised. This may result in reserve
    increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in
    periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed.

The risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves have
    increased under the current financial market conditions. It is
    especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss
    reserves given the current economic environment and related
    government actions. Whereas a slowing economy would generally
    lead to lower inflation or even deflation, increased government
    spending would generally lead to higher inflation. A change in
    our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve
    increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings
    in periods in which such assumptions are changed.

Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability.
    Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management
    expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will
    cost. While the methods for establishing the reserves are well
    tested over time, some of the major assumptions about
    anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated
    fluctuation. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial
    projections, are based on management’s assessment of facts
    and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of future
    trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of
    liability and other factors, including the actions of third
    parties, which are beyond the Company’s control. These
    variables are affected by external and internal events, such as
    inflation and economic volatility, judicial and litigation
    trends, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and claim
    handling and reserving practices, which make it more difficult
    to accurately predict claim costs. The inherent uncertainties of
    estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities
    where long periods of time elapse before a definitive
    determination of liability is made. Because setting reserves is
    inherently uncertain, the Company cannot assure that its current
    reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.

We discount our liabilities for excess workers’
    compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion
    of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time
    over which losses are paid. Discounting is intended to
    appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on
    investment securities supporting the liabilities. The expected
    losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting
    was derived from the Company’s loss payout experience. For
    non-proportional business, reserves for losses and loss expenses
    have been discounted using risk-free discount rates determined
    by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. These
    discount rates range from 2.7% to 6.5% with a weighted average
    discount rate of 4.4%. For proportional business, reserves for
    losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory
    rate permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of
    Delaware of 2.7%. The aggregate net discount, after reflecting
    the effects of ceded reinsurance, is $877,305,000, $846,748,000
    and $787,988,000 at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The increase in the aggregate discount from 2008
    to 2009 and from 2007 to 2008 resulted from the increase in
    workers’ compensation gross reserves.

To date, known asbestos and environmental claims at our
    insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on
    our operations. These claims have not materially impacted us
    because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger
    industrial companies which are subject to significant
    environmental exposures.



Our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses
    relating to asbestos and environmental claims were $36,525,000
    and $39,646,000 at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The Company’s gross reserves for losses and
    loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental
    claims were $53,986,000 and $56,957,000 at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Net incurred losses and loss
    expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were
    approximately $(614,000), $440,000 and $7,029,000 in 2009, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Net paid losses and loss expenses for
    reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately
    $2,508,000, $2,384,000 and $2,912,000 in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The estimation of these liabilities is subject to
    significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty
    because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate
    of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted
    actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential
    affect of significant unresolved legal matters, including
    coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal
    issues. Additionally, the determination of ultimate damages and
    the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible
    parties are highly uncertain.

The following table presents the development of net reserves for
    1999 through 2009. The top line of the table shows the estimated
    reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the
    balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This
    represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for
    claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance
    sheet date, including losses that had been incurred but not
    reported to us. The upper portion of the table shows the
    re-estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on
    experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimate
    changes as more information becomes known about the frequency
    and severity of claims for individual years.

The “cumulative redundancy (deficiency)” represents
    the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years. For
    example, the 1999 reserves have developed a $688 million
    deficiency over ten years. That amount has been reflected in
    income over the ten years. The impact on the results of
    operations of the past three years of changes in reserve
    estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above. It should
    be noted that the table presents a “run off” of
    balance sheet reserves, rather than accident or policy year loss
    development. Therefore, each amount in the table includes the
    effects of changes in reserves for all prior years. For example,
    assume a claim that occurred in 1999 is reserved for $2,000 as
    of December 31, 1999. Assuming this claim estimate was
    changed in 2009 to $2,300, and was settled for $2,300 in 2008,
    the $300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year
    from 1999 through 2009.

Reinsurance

We follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of
    our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums
    received on the policies that we write. Reinsurance is purchased
    principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to
    protect against catastrophic losses. Although reinsurance does
    not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for
    the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming
    reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of
    the reinsurance coverage. We monitor the financial condition of
    our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with
    substantial, financially sound carriers. As a result, generally
    the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an
    A.M. Best rating of “A (Excellent)” or better
    with at least $500 million in policyholder surplus and the
    reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an
    A.M. Best rating of “A-(Excellent)” or better
    with at least $250 million in policyholder surplus.



Regulation

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of
    regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do
    business, and the Company believes that it is in compliance in
    all material respects with such regulations. Our insurance
    subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory,
    supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance
    commissioners. This regulation relates to such matters as the
    standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; the
    licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and
    limitations on investments; deposits of securities for the
    benefit of policyholders; approval of certain policy forms and
    premium rates; periodic examination of the affairs of insurance
    companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the
    financial condition of insurers or for other purposes;
    establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums
    and losses; and requirements regarding numerous other matters.
    Our property casualty subsidiaries, other than excess and
    surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries, must generally file all
    rates with the insurance department of each state in which they
    operate. Our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries
    generally operate free of rate and form regulation.

In addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance
    subsidiaries, we are subject to state statutes governing
    insurance holding company systems. Typically, such statutes
    require that we periodically file information with the
    appropriate state insurance commissioner, including information
    concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition
    and general business operations. Under the terms of applicable
    state statutes, any person or entity desiring to purchase more
    than a specified percentage (commonly 10%) of our outstanding
    voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory
    approval of the purchase. Under Alabama law, which is applicable
    to us due to our ownership of American Mining Insurance Company,
    Inc., an Alabama domiciled insurance company, the acquisition of
    more than 5% of our capital stock is subject to prior regulatory
    approval. Further, state insurance statutes typically place
    limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions
    payable by insurance companies in order to protect their
    solvency. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and
    Capital Resources.”

Various state and federal organizations, including Congressional
    committees and the National Association of Insurance
    Commissioners (“NAIC”), have been conducting reviews
    into various aspects of the insurance business. The insurance
    industry has been the subject of scrutiny with respect to
    insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements and sales
    practices. State and federal regulators have conducted
    proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements
    between producers and issuers of insurance products, and alleged
    unsuitable sales practices. No assurance can be given that
    future legislative or regulatory changes resulting from such
    activities will not adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries.

The NAIC utilizes a Risk Based Capital (“RBC”) formula
    that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s
    statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its
    business. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level
    of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to
    various asset, premium and reserve items. The RBC Model Law
    provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for
    insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These
    levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer
    to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the
    insurer under regulatory control. The RBC of each of our
    domestic insurance subsidiaries was above the authorized RBC
    control level as of December 31, 2009.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or Financial Services Modernization
    Act of 1999 (the “Act”), was enacted in 1999 and
    significantly affects the financial services industry, including
    insurance companies, banks and securities firms. The Act
    modifies federal law to permit the creation of financial holding
    companies, which, as regulated by the Act, can maintain
    cross-holdings in insurance companies, banks and securities
    firms to an extent not previously allowed. The Act also permits
    or facilitates certain types of combinations or affiliations for
    financial holding companies. The Act establishes a functional
    regulatory scheme under which state insurance departments will
    maintain primary regulation over insurance activities, subject
    to provisions for certain federal preemptions.

Our insurance company subsidiaries are also subject to
    assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a
    particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent
    and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company
    to pay policyholders and claimants. The protection afforded
    under a state’s guaranty fund to policyholders of the
    insolvent insurer varies from state to state. Generally, all
    licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members
    of the fund, and assessments are based upon their pro rata share
    of direct written premiums. The NAIC



Model Post-Assessment Guaranty Fund Act, which many states
    have adopted, limits assessments to an insurer to 2% of its
    subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through
    rate setting. Likewise, several states (or underwriting
    organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required
    to be members) have limited assessment authority with regard to
    deficits in certain lines of business.

We receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the
    form of dividends and management fees for certain management
    services. Annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts
    prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the
    approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an
    insurance subsidiary is domiciled.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 became effective
    November 26, 2002, was amended on December 22, 2005 by
    the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 and further
    amended effective December 26, 2007 by the Terrorism Risk
    Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (collectively,
    “TRIA”). TRIA established a Federal program that
    provides for a system of shared public and private compensation
    for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. The program
    is effective through December 31, 2014. TRIA is applicable
    to almost all commercial lines of property and casualty
    insurance but excludes commercial auto, burglary and theft,
    surety, professional liability and farm owners’ multi-peril
    insurance. Insurers with direct commercial property and casualty
    insurance exposure in the United States are required to
    participate in the program and make available coverage for
    certified acts of terrorism. The most recent amendment to TRIA
    broadened the definition of certified acts to include domestic
    terrorism. Federal participation will be triggered under TRIA
    when the Secretary of Treasury certifies an act of terrorism.
    Under the program, the federal government will pay 85% of an
    insurer’s covered losses in excess of the insurer’s
    applicable deductible. The insurer’s deductible is based on
    20% percent of earned premium for the prior year for covered
    lines of commercial property and casualty insurance. Based on
    our 2009 earned premiums, our deductible under TRIA during 2010
    will be approximately $512 million. The federal program
    will not pay losses for certified acts unless such losses exceed
    $100 million. TRIA limits the federal government’s
    share of losses at $100 billion for a program year. In
    addition, an insurer that has satisfied its deductible is not
    liable for the payment of losses in excess of the
    $100 billion cap.

Competition

The property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are
    highly competitive, with over 2,000 insurance companies
    transacting business in the United States. We compete directly
    with a large number of these companies. Our strategy in this
    highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or
    geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a
    competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market
    conditions. Our subsidiaries establish their own pricing
    practices. Such practices are based upon a Company-wide
    philosophy to price products with the intent of making an
    underwriting profit. Competition in our industry generally
    changes with profitability and has increased since 2004. As a
    result of increased competition, we have experienced both
    downward pressure on pricing for many of our insurance lines as
    well as demands by insureds and cedants for better terms and
    conditions.

Competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes
    from other specialty insurers, regional carriers, large national
    multi-line companies and reinsurers. Standard carriers have
    increasingly competed for excess and surplus business.

Competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and
    foreign reinsurers, which produce their business either on a
    direct basis or through the broker market. These competitors
    include Swiss Re, Munich Re, Berkshire Hathaway, Transatlantic
    Reinsurance, and Partner Re.

The regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual
    and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers.
    Direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with the
    regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their
    salaried employees, generally at a lower acquisition cost than
    through independent agents such as those used by the Company.

The international operations compete with native insurance
    operations both large and small, which may be related to
    government entities, as well as with branches or local
    subsidiaries of multinational companies.



Competition from insurers based in Bermuda and other tax
    advantaged jurisdictions has increased over the last several
    years, including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreign
    based entities especially as to excess and surplus lines
    business.

Employees

As of February 16, 2010, we employed 6,072 individuals. Of
    this number, our subsidiaries employed 5,978 persons and
    the remaining 94 persons were employed at the parent
    company.

Other
    Information about the Company’s Business

We maintain an interest in the acquisition or start up of
    complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible
    acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis. In addition,
    our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of
    business to meet the needs of insureds.

Seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity
    and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and
    reinsurance subsidiaries. Although the effect on our business of
    catastrophes such as tornadoes, hurricanes, hailstorms,
    earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance,
    they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results
    of any one or more reporting periods.

We have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more
    of our consolidated revenues.

Compliance by W. R. Berkley and its subsidiaries with federal,
    state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted
    regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or
    otherwise relating to protection of the environment, has not had
    a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or
    competitive position.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Our businesses face significant risks. If any of the events or
    circumstances described as risks below actually occurs, our
    businesses, results of operations or financial condition could
    be materially and adversely affected.

Risks
    Relating to Our Industry

Our
    results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including
    cyclical changes in the insurance and reinsurance
    industry.

The results of companies in the property casualty insurance
    industry historically have been subject to significant
    fluctuations and uncertainties. The demand for insurance is
    influenced primarily by general economic conditions, while the
    supply of insurance is directly related to available capacity.
    Over the past several years, we have faced increased competition
    in our business, including as a result of an increased flow of
    capital into the insurance and reinsurance industry, with both
    new entrants and existing insurers seeking to gain market share.
    This has resulted in decreased premium rates and at times less
    favorable contract terms and conditions. The adequacy of premium
    rates is affected mainly by the severity and frequency of
    claims, which are influenced by many factors, including natural
    disasters, regulatory measures and court decisions that define
    and expand the extent of coverage and the effects of economic
    inflation on the amount of compensation due for injuries or
    losses. In addition, investment rates of return may impact rate
    adequacy. These factors can have a significant impact on
    ultimate profitability because a property casualty insurance
    policy is priced before its costs are known as premiums usually
    are determined long before claims are reported. These factors
    could produce results that would have a negative impact on our
    results of operations and financial condition.



Our
    actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, which
    may require us to establish additional reserves.

Our gross reserves for losses and loss expenses were
    approximately $9 billion as of December 31, 2009. Our
    loss reserves reflect our best estimates of the cost of settling
    claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that
    have occurred.

Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability.
    Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management
    expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will
    cost for claims that have occurred, whether known or unknown.
    The major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns
    are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. These estimates, which
    generally involve actuarial projections, are based on
    management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then
    known, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity
    and frequency, inflation, judicial theories of liability,
    reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and other factors,
    including the actions of third parties, which are beyond our
    control.

The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater
    for certain types of liabilities, where long periods of time
    elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made
    and settlement is reached. In periods with increased economic
    volatility, such as under the current financial market
    conditions, it becomes more difficult to accurately predict
    claim costs. It is especially difficult to estimate the impact
    of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic
    environment and related government actions. Reserve estimates
    are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience
    develops and further claims are reported and settled.
    Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the
    periods in which such estimates are changed. Because setting
    reserves is inherently uncertain, we cannot assure that our
    current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent
    events. Should we need to increase our reserves, our pre-tax
    income for the reporting period would decrease by a
    corresponding amount.

We decreased our estimates for claims occurring in prior years
    by $234 million in 2009, $196 million in 2008 and
    $106 million in 2007, and increased our estimates by
    $27 million in 2006 and $187 million in 2005. We,
    along with the property casualty insurance industry in general,
    have experienced higher than expected losses for certain types
    of business written from 1999 to 2002. Although our reserves
    reflect our best estimate of the costs of settling claims, we
    cannot assure you that our claim estimates will not need to be
    increased in the future.

We discount our reserves for excess and assumed workers’
    compensation business because of the long period of time over
    which losses are paid. Discounting is intended to appropriately
    match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment
    securities supporting liabilities. The expected loss and loss
    expense payout pattern subject to discounting is derived from
    our loss payout experience. Changes in the loss and loss expense
    payout pattern are recorded in the period they are determined.
    If the actual loss payout pattern is shorter than anticipated,
    the discount will be reduced and pre-tax income will decrease by
    a corresponding amount.

As a
    property casualty insurer, we face losses from natural and
    man-made catastrophes.

Property casualty insurers are subject to claims arising out of
    catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results
    of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Catastrophe
    losses have had a significant impact on our results. In
    addition, through our participation in certain Lloyd’s
    syndicates, we have additional exposure to catastrophic losses.
    For example, weather-related losses were $63 million in
    2009, $114 million in 2008, $34 million in 2007,
    $39 million in 2006 and $99 million in 2005.

Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including
    hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions,
    severe winter weather and fires, as well as terrorist
    activities. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are
    inherently unpredictable but have increased in recent years. The
    extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the
    total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the
    event and the severity of the event. Some catastrophes are
    restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes and
    earthquakes may produce significant damage in large, heavily
    populated areas. Catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of
    our property and casualty lines, and most of our past
    catastrophe-related claims have resulted from severe storms.
    Seasonal weather variations or physical impacts of climate
    change may affect the severity and frequency of our losses.
    Insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for a
    catastrophe until it has occurred. It is therefore possible that
    a catastrophic event or



multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses
    and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
    and financial condition.

We
    face significant competitive pressures in our businesses, which
    have reduced premium rates and could harm our ability to
    maintain or increase our profitability and premium
    volume.

We compete with a large number of other companies in our
    selected lines of business. We compete, and will continue to
    compete, with major U.S. and

non-U.S. insurers

and reinsurers, other regional companies, as well as mutual
    companies, specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies
    and diversified financial services companies, some of which have
    implicit or explicit government support. Competitiveness in our
    businesses is based on many factors, including premium charges,
    ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, commissions
    paid to producers, the perceived financial strength of the
    company, other terms and conditions offered, services provided,
    speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the
    lines to be written.

Some of our competitors, particularly in the reinsurance
    business, have greater financial and marketing resources than we
    do. These competitors within the reinsurance segment include
    Swiss Re, Munich Re, Berkshire Hathaway, Transatlantic
    Reinsurance, and Partner Re. We expect that perceived financial
    strength, in particular, will become more important as customers
    seek high quality reinsurers. Certain of our competitors operate
    from Bermuda or other tax advantaged or less regulated
    jurisdictions that may provide them with additional competitive
    and pricing advantages.

Over the past several years, we have faced increased competition
    in our business, particularly in our reinsurance segment, as
    increased supply has led to reduced prices. Our specialty
    segment increasingly encounters competition from admitted
    companies seeking to increase market share. We expect to
    continue to face strong competition in these and our other lines
    of business and may continue to experience reduced pricing and
    weaker terms and conditions.

This intense competition could cause the supply

and/or

demand for insurance or reinsurance to change, which could
    affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and
    retain existing business or write new products at adequate rates
    or on acceptable terms and conditions. If we are unable to
    retain existing business or write new business at adequate
    rates, our results of operations could be materially and
    adversely affected.

Current
    conditions in the financial markets and the ongoing economic
    downturn have had and may continue to have a negative impact on
    our results of operations and financial condition, particularly
    if such conditions continue.

The significant volatility and uncertainty experienced in
    financial markets around the world during the past several years
    and the ongoing economic downturn have continued. Although the
    U.S. and various foreign governments have taken various
    actions to try to stabilize the financial markets, it is unclear
    whether those actions will be effective. Therefore, volatility
    and uncertainty in the financial markets and the resulting
    negative economic impact may continue for some time.

While we monitor conditions in the financial markets, we cannot
    predict future conditions or their impact on our results of
    operations and financial condition. Depending on conditions in
    the financial markets, we could incur additional realized and
    unrealized losses in our investment portfolio in future periods,
    and financial market volatility and uncertainty and an economic
    downturn could have a significant negative impact on third
    parties that we do business with, including insureds and
    reinsurers.

We, as
    a primary insurer, may have significant exposure for terrorist
    acts.

To the extent an act of terrorism, whether a domestic or foreign
    act, is certified by the Secretary of Treasury, we may be
    covered under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as
    amended on December 22, 2005 and further amended on
    December 26, 2007 (“TRIA”), for up to 85% of our
    losses for certain property/casualty lines of insurance.
    However, any such coverage would be subject to a mandatory
    deductible based on 20% of earned premium for the prior year for
    the covered lines of commercial property and casualty insurance.
    Based on our 2009 earned premiums, our deductible under TRIA
    during 2010 is approximately $512 million. TRIA is in
    effect through



December 31, 2014 unless extended or replaced by a similar
    program. The coverage provided under TRIA does not apply to
    reinsurance that we write.

Our
    earnings could be more volatile because of our significant level
    of retentions.

As compared to a number of our competitors, we maintain
    significant retention levels in premiums written. We purchase
    less reinsurance, the process by which we transfer, or cede,
    part of the risk we have assumed to a reinsurance company,
    thereby retaining more risk. As a result, our earnings could be
    more volatile and increased severities are more likely to have a
    material adverse effect on our results of operations and
    financial condition.

We are
    subject to extensive governmental regulation, which increases
    our costs and could restrict the conduct of our
    business.

We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and
    supervision. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect
    the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and
    other investors. This system of regulation, generally
    administered by a department of insurance in each state in which
    we do business, relates to, among other things:

•

standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;

•

restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of
    investments;

•

requiring certain methods of accounting;

•

rate and form regulation pertaining to certain of our insurance
    businesses; and

•

potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for
    the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided
    by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies.

State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the
    affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual
    and other reports relating to the financial condition of
    insurance companies, holding company issues and other matters.
    Federal financial services modernization legislation and
    legislative and regulatory initiatives taken or which may be
    taken in response to the current conditions in the financial
    markets and the ongoing economic downturn may lead to additional
    federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming
    years. We may be subject to potentially increased federal
    oversight as a financial institution. Also, foreign governments
    regulate our international operations.

The insurance industry has been the subject of scrutiny with
    respect to insurance broker and agent compensation arrangements
    and sales practices. The New York State Attorney General and
    other state and federal regulators have conducted investigations
    and other proceedings relating to compensation and bidding
    arrangements between producers and issuers of insurance
    products, and alleged unsuitable sales practices by producers on
    behalf of either the issuer or the purchaser. The practices
    included, among other things that certain brokers and insurers
    may have engaged in anti-competitive practices in connection
    with insurance premium quotes. New investigative proceedings may
    be commenced in the future. These investigations and proceedings
    could result in legal precedents and new industry-wide practices
    or legislation, rules or regulations that could significantly
    affect the insurance industry and the Company.

We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals
    and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of
    applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s
    interpretation of the laws and regulations. Also, some
    regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to
    grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have
    the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with
    applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory
    authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from
    carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize
    us. Also, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance
    industry, whether federal, state or foreign, or changes in laws
    or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory
    authorities, restrict the conduct of our business.

In certain of our insurance businesses, the rates we charge our
    policyholders are subject to regulatory approval. Certain lines
    of business are subject to a greater degree of regulatory
    scrutiny than others. For example, the workers’



compensation business is highly regulated. For 2009,
    approximately 16.1% of our net premiums written represented
    primary workers’ compensation business. Over the past
    several years, rates for primary workers’ compensation
    business written in the State of California have declined
    significantly as a result of workers’ compensation reform.
    Of our net premiums written during 2009, approximately 1.4%
    represented primary workers’ compensation business written
    in the State of California.

Risks
    Relating to Our Business

We
    cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely
    fashion, if at all, and, as a result, we could experience
    losses.

We purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we
    have assumed, known as ceding, to a reinsurance company in
    exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with
    the risk. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer contractually
    liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to
    the reinsurer, it does not relieve us, the reinsured, of our
    liability to our policyholders. Our reinsurers may not pay the
    reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay
    such recoverables on a timely basis. Accordingly, we bear credit
    risk with respect to our reinsurers, and if our reinsurers fail
    to pay us, our financial results would be adversely affected.
    Underwriting results and investment returns of some of our
    reinsurers may affect their future ability to pay claims. As of
    December 31, 2009, the amount due from our reinsurers was
    approximately $973 million, including amounts due from
    state funds and industry pools. Certain of these amounts due
    from reinsurers are secured by letters of credit or by funds
    held in trust on our behalf.

We are
    rated by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s, and
    Moody’s, and a decline in these ratings could affect our
    standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and
    earnings to decrease.

Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in
    establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.
    Certain of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by
    A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s and
    Moody’s Investors. Our ratings are subject to periodic
    review, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain
    those ratings.

If our ratings are reduced from their current levels by
    A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s or
    Moody’s, our competitive position in the insurance industry
    could suffer and it would be more difficult for us to market our
    products. A significant downgrade could result in a substantial
    loss of business as policyholders move to other companies with
    higher claims-paying and financial strength ratings.

If
    market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or
    unavailable, we may be required to bear increased risks or
    reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.

As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we
    purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by
    our insurance company subsidiaries, especially catastrophe
    risks. We also purchase reinsurance on risks underwritten by
    others which we reinsure. Market conditions beyond our control
    determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance
    protection we seek to purchase, which may affect the level of
    our business and profitability. Our reinsurance contracts are
    generally subject to annual renewal. We may be unable to
    maintain our current reinsurance contracts or to obtain other
    reinsurance contracts in adequate amounts and at favorable
    rates. In addition, we may be unable to obtain reinsurance on
    terms acceptable to us relating to certain lines of business
    that we intend to begin writing. If we are unable to renew our
    expiring contracts or to obtain new reinsurance contracts,
    either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling
    to bear an increase in net exposures, we would have to reduce
    the level of our underwriting commitments, especially
    catastrophe exposed risks.

Depending
    on conditions in the financial markets and the ongoing economic
    downturn, we may be unable to raise debt or equity capital if
    needed.

If the current conditions in the financial markets and the
    ongoing economic downturn continue, we may be unable to access
    debt or equity capital on acceptable terms if needed, which
    could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in our
    insurance company subsidiaries

and/or

to
    take advantage of opportunities to expand our business, such as
    possible acquisitions and new ventures.



Our
    international operations expose us to investment, political and
    economic risks, including foreign currency and credit
    risk.

Our expanding international operations in the United Kingdom,
    Continental Europe, South America, Australia, Southeast Asia and
    Canada expose us to investment, political and economic risks,
    including foreign currency and credit risk. Changes in the value
    of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could have
    an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
    condition.

Our investments in

non-U.S.-denominated

securities are subject to fluctuations in

non-U.S. securities

and currency markets, and those markets can be volatile.

Non-U.S. currency

fluctuations also affect the value of any dividends paid by our

non-U.S. subsidiaries

to their parent companies in the U.S.

We may
    not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance
    ventures and even if we do, we may not successfully integrate
    any such acquired companies or successfully invest in such
    ventures.

As part of our present strategy, we continue to evaluate
    possible acquisition transactions and the

start-up

of
    complementary businesses on an ongoing basis, and at any given
    time we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible
    acquisitions and new ventures. We cannot assure you that we will
    be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or
    insurance ventures, that such transactions will be financed and
    completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or

start-up

ventures will be successful. The process of integrating any
    companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures may have a
    material adverse effect on our results of operations and
    financial condition.

We may
    be unable to attract and retain qualified
    employees.

We depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced
    underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are
    knowledgeable about our business. If the quality of our
    underwriting team and other personnel decreases, we may be
    unable to maintain our current competitive position in the
    specialized markets in which we operate, and be unable to expand
    our operations into new markets.

Risks
    Relating to Our Investments

A
    significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed maturity
    securities and is subject to market fluctuations.

Our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed
    maturity securities. As of December 31, 2009, our
    investment in fixed maturity securities was approximately
    $11.3 billion, or 87% of our total investment portfolio. As
    of that date, our portfolio of fixed maturity securities
    consisted of the following types of securities:
    U.S. Government securities (15%); state and municipal
    securities (52%); corporate securities (15%); mortgage-backed
    securities (14%) and foreign government bonds (4%).

The fair value of these assets and the investment income from
    these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market
    conditions. The fair value of fixed maturity securities
    generally decreases as interest rates rise. Conversely, if
    interest rates decline, investment income earned from future
    investments in fixed maturity securities will be lower. In
    addition, some fixed maturity securities, such as
    mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, carry
    prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations.

The value of investments in fixed maturity securities is subject
    to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit
    worthiness of the issuer, default by the issuer (including
    states and municipalities) in the performance of its obligations
    in respect of the securities

and/or

increases in market interest rates. To a large degree, the
    credit risk we face is a function of the economy; accordingly,
    we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession.
    Additionally, our investments are subject to losses as a result
    of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an
    industry sector in which we invest, as well as risks inherent in
    particular securities.

Although we attempt to manage these risks through the use of
    investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms and by
    diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of
    principal, our efforts may not be successful. Impairments,
    defaults and/or rate increases could reduce our net investment
    income and net realized



investment gains or result in investment losses. Investment
    returns are currently, and will likely continue to remain, under
    pressure due to the significant volatility and disruption
    currently experienced in the financial markets, current and
    continuing economic uncertainty, more generally, and the shape
    of the yield curve. As a result, our exposure to the risks
    described above could materially and adversely affect our
    results of operations.

We
    invest some of our assets in equity securities, merger arbitrage
    securities, investment funds, private equity and real estate
    related assets, which may decline in value.

We invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity
    securities, merger arbitrage securities, investment funds,
    private equity and real estate related assets. At
    December 31, 2009, our investment in these assets was
    approximately $1.8 billion, or 13%, of our investment
    portfolio. We reported provisions for other than temporary
    impairments in the value of these assets of approximately
    $63 million in 2009 and $427 million in 2008, and
    losses from investment funds of $174 million in 2009.

Merger and convertible arbitrage trading securities were
    $549 million, or 4%, of our investment portfolio at
    December 31, 2009. Merger arbitrage involves investing in
    the securities of publicly held companies that are the targets
    in announced tender offers and mergers. Merger arbitrage differs
    from other types of investments in its focus on transactions and
    events believed likely to bring about a change in value over a
    relatively short time period, usually four months or less. Our
    merger arbitrage positions are exposed to the risk associated
    with the completion of announced deals, which are subject to
    regulatory as well as political and other risks.

Investments in publicly traded real estate investment trusts,
    real estate investment funds and limited partnerships and loans
    receivable were $701 million, or 5%, of our investment
    portfolio at December 31, 2009. The values of our real
    estate related investments are subject to fluctuations based on
    changes in the economy in general and real estate valuations in
    particular. These investments have been subject to significant
    volatility as a result of the current conditions in the
    financial markets. In addition, our investments in real estate
    related assets are less liquid than our other investments.

Risks
    Relating to Purchasing Our Securities

We are
    an insurance holding company and, therefore, may not be able to
    receive dividends in needed amounts.

As an insurance holding company, our principal assets are the
    shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries.
    We have to rely on dividends from our insurance company
    subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and
    interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying
    dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses. The payment of
    dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to
    regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and
    future earnings of these subsidiaries, as well as regulatory
    restrictions. During 2010, the maximum amount of dividends that
    can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately
    $384 million. As a result, in the future we may not be able
    to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in
    amounts necessary to meet our obligations or pay dividends.

We are
    subject to certain provisions that may have the effect of
    hindering, delaying or preventing third party takeovers, which
    may prevent our stockholders from receiving premium prices for
    their shares in an unsolicited takeover and make it more
    difficult for third parties to replace our current
    management.

Provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
    By-Laws, as well as state insurance statutes, may hinder, delay
    or prevent unsolicited acquisitions or changes of our control.
    These provisions may also have the effect of making it more
    difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of our
    current management without the concurrence of our board of
    directors.

These provisions include:

•

our classified board of directors and the ability of our board
    to increase its size and to appoint directors to fill newly
    created directorships;



•

the requirement that 80% of our stockholders must approve
    mergers and other transactions between us and the holder of 5%
    or more of our shares, unless the transaction was approved by
    our board of directors prior to such holder’s acquisition
    of 5% of our shares;

•

the need for advance notice in order to raise business or make
    nominations at stockholders’ meetings; and

•

state insurance statutes that restrict the acquisition of
    control (generally defined as 10% of the outstanding shares,
    though 5% in Alabama and certain other jurisdictions) of an
    insurance company without regulatory approval.

ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED
    STAFF COMMENTS

There are no unresolved written comments that were received from
    the SEC staff 180 days or more before the end of our fiscal
    year relating to our periodic or current reports under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

The Company’s subsidiaries are subject to disputes,
    including litigation and arbitration, arising in the ordinary
    course of their insurance and reinsurance businesses. The
    Company’s estimates of the costs of settling such matters
    are reflected in its aggregate reserves for losses and loss
    expenses, and the Company does not believe that the ultimate
    outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on
    its financial condition or results of operations.
