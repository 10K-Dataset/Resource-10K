Item 1a.

Risk Factors

As required the Company is providing the following cautionary statements
which identify factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to
differ materially from historical and expected results. It is not possible
to foresee or identify all such factors. Investors should not consider this
list an exhaustive statement of all risks and uncertainties.

Historical Growth Rates

Continuance of the Company’s historical growth rate depends upon a
number of uncertain events including the outcome of the Company’s
strategies of expanding its penetration in global markets, introduction
of new products and services, and acquisitions. Difficulties, delays or
failure of the Company’s strategies could cause the future growth of the
Company to differ materially from its historical growth rate.

Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or
Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other
Volatility in the Financial Markets

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

A writ of summons was served on The McGraw-Hill Companies, SRL and on The
McGraw-Hill Companies, SA (both indirect subsidiaries of the Company)
(collectively, “Standard & Poor’s”) on September 29, 2005 and October 7,
2005, respectively, in an action brought in the Tribunal of Milan, Italy by
Enrico Bondi (“Bondi”), the Extraordinary Commissioner of Parmalat
Finanziaria S.p.A. and Parmalat S.p.A. (collectively, “Parmalat”). Bondi
has brought numerous other lawsuits in both Italy and the United States
against entities and individuals who had dealings with Parmalat. In this
suit, Bondi claims that Standard & Poor’s, which had issued investment
grade ratings of Parmalat until shortly before Parmalat’s collapse in
December 2003, breached its duty to issue an independent and professional
rating and negligently and knowingly assigned inflated ratings in order to
retain Parmalat’s business. Alleging joint and several liability, Bondi
claims damages of euros 4,073,984,120 (representing the value of bonds
issued by Parmalat and the rating fees paid by Parmalat) with interest,
plus damages to be ascertained for Standard & Poor’s alleged complicity in
aggravating Parmalat’s financial difficulties and/or for having contributed
in bringing about Parmalat’s indebtedness towards its bondholders, and
legal fees. The Company believes that Bondi’s allegations and claims for
damages lack legal or factual merit. Standard & Poor’s filed its answer,
counterclaim and third-party claims on March 16, 2006 and will continue to
vigorously contest the action. The next hearing is scheduled for March 8,
2007.

In a separate proceeding, the prosecutor’s office in Parma, Italy is
conducting an investigation into the bankruptcy of Parmalat. In June 2006,
the prosecutor’s office issued a Note of Completion of an Investigation
(“Note of Completion”) concerning allegations, based on Standard & Poor’s
investment grade ratings of Parmalat, that individual Standard & Poor’s
rating analysts conspired with Parmalat insiders and rating advisors to
fraudulently or negligently cause the Parmalat bankruptcy. The Note of
Completion was served on eight Standard & Poor’s rating analysts.

While not a formal charge, the Note of Completion indicates the
prosecutor’s intention that the named rating analysts should appear before
a judge in Parma for a preliminary hearing, at which hearing the judge will
determine whether there is sufficient evidence against the rating analysts
to proceed to trial. No date has been set for the preliminary hearing. On
July 7, 2006, a defense brief was filed with the Parma prosecutor’s office
on behalf of the rating analysts. The Company believes that there is no
basis in fact or law to support the allegations against the rating
analysts, and they will be vigorously defended by the subsidiaries
involved.

In addition, in the normal course of business both in the United States and
abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal
proceedings and are involved, from time to time, in governmental and
self-regulatory agency proceedings, which may result in adverse judgments,
damages, fines or penalties. Also, various governmental and self-regulatory
agencies regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Based on information
currently known by the Company’s management, the Company does not believe
that any pending legal, governmental or self-regulatory proceedings or
investigations will result in a material adverse effect on its financial
condition or results of operations.

On February 15, 2007, the closing price of the Registrant’s common stock was $67.69

record holders of the Registrant’s common stock as of February 15, 2007 was 6,861.

On January 29, 2003, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase
program of up to 30 million additional shares, which was approximately 7.8%
of the total shares (post-split) of the Company’s outstanding common stock as
of January 29, 2003. As of December 31, 2005, 3.4 million shares remained
available under the 2003 repurchase program. On January 24, 2006 the Board
of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase
of up to 45 million additional shares, which was approximately 12.1% of the
total shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock as of January 24,
2006. In the first quarter of 2006, the Company repurchased
18.4 million shares, including 15 million shares from the new program and the
3.4 million shares remaining under the 2003 program. On April 26, 2006, the Board of
Directors approved an additional 10 million shares for repurchase in 2006
under the existing program. The repurchase programs have no expiration date.
The repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including
the issuance of shares in connection with the exercise of employee stock
options. Purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the
open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions. On
January 31, 2007, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase
program (2007 program) authorizing the repurchase of up to 45 million
additional shares.

On March 30, 2006, the Company acquired 8.4 million shares of The McGraw-Hill
Companies common stock from the holdings of the recently decreased William H.
McGraw, in a related party transaction. The shares were purchased at a
discount of approximately 2.4% from the March 30, 2006 New York Stock
Exchange closing price through a private transaction with Mr. McGraw’s
estate. The transaction was approved by the Financial Policy and Audit
Committees of the Company’s Board of Directors. The Company received
independent financial and legal advice concerning the purchase.

The following table provides information on purchases made by the Company of
its outstanding common stock during the fourth quarter of 2006 pursuant to
the stock repurchase program authorized on January 24, 2006 by the Board of
Directors (column c). In addition to purchases under the 2006 stock
repurchase program, the number of shares in column (a) include; 1) shares of
common stock that are tendered to the Registrant to satisfy the employees’
tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of awards of
restricted performance shares (such shares are repurchased by the Registrant
based on their fair market value on the vesting date), and 2) shares of the
Registrant deemed surrendered to the Registrant to pay the exercise price and
to satisfy the employees’ tax withholding obligations in connection with the
exercise of employee stock options. There were no other share repurchases

Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief
Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

As of December 31, 2006, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and
with the participation of the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management,
including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of December 31, 2006.



Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Section 404) and as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
management is required to provide the following report on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting:

1.

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
Company.

2.

The Company’s management has evaluated the system of
internal control using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) framework. Management has selected the COSO
framework for its evaluation as it is a control framework recognized by the
SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that is free from
bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative
measurement of the Company’s internal controls, is sufficiently complete so
that relevant controls are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of
internal controls over financial reporting.

3.

Based on management’s evaluation under this framework, we
have concluded that the Company’s internal controls over financial
reporting were effective as of December 31, 2006. There are no material
weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that
have been identified by management.

4.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
firm, Ernst & Young LLP, have audited the consolidated financial statements
of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2006, and have issued their
reports on the financial statements and management’s assessment as to the
effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting under Auditing
Standard No. 2 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. These
reports are located on pages 72 and 73 of the 2006 Annual Report to
Shareholders.

Other Matters

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial
reporting during the most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

Included in this number are 34,806,589 shares to be issued upon

and 191,545 deferred units already credited but to be issued under the
Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan.

(2)

Included in this number are 563,423 shares reserved for
issuance under the Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan. The remaining
22,491,035 shares are reserved for issuance under the 2002 Stock Incentive
Plan (the “2002 Plan”) for Performance Stock, Restricted Stock, Other
Stock-Based Awards, Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”).

(3)

Under the terms of the 2002 Plan, shares subject to an award
(other than a stock option, SAR, or dividend equivalent) or shares
paid in settlement of a dividend equivalent reduce the number of shares



available under the 2002 Plan by one share for each such share granted or paid;
shares subject to a stock option or SAR reduce the number of shares
available under the 2002 Plan by one-third of a share for each such share
granted. The 2002 Plan stipulates that in no case, as a result of such
share counting, may more than 19,000,000 shares of stock be issued
thereunder. Accordingly, for purposes of setting forth the figures in this
column, the base figure from which issuances of stock awards are deducted,
is deemed to be 19,000,000 shares for the 2002 Plan plus shares reserved
for grant immediately prior to the amendments to the 2002 Plan of April
28, 2004.

The 2002 Plan is also governed by certain share recapture provisions. The
aggregate number of shares of stock available under the 2002 Plan for
issuance are increased by the number of shares of stock granted as an
award under the 2002 Plan or 1993 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “1993
Plan”)(other than stock option, SAR or 1993 Plan stock option awards) or
by one-third of the number of shares of stock in the case of stock option,
SAR or 1993 Plan stock option awards that are, in each case: forfeited,
settled in cash or property other than stock, or otherwise not
distributable under an award under the Plan; tendered or withheld to pay
the exercise or purchase price of an award under the 2002 or 1993 Plans or
to satisfy applicable wage or other required tax withholding in connection
with the exercise, vesting or payment of, or other event related to, an
award under the 2002 or 1993 Plan; or repurchased by the Company with the
option proceeds in respect of the exercise of a stock option under the
2002 or 1993 Plans.
