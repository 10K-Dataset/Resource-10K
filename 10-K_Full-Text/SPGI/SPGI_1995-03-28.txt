Item 1.   Business
- -------   --------
The Registrant, incorporated in December 1925, serves business, professional and
educational markets around the world with information products and services. Key
markets include finance, business, education, law, construction, medical and
health, computers and communications, aerospace and defense. As a multimedia
publishing and information company, the Registrant employs a broad range of
media, including books, magazines, newsletters, software, on-line data services,
CD-ROMs, facsimile and television broadcasting. Most of the Registrant's
products and services face substantial competition from a variety of sources.

The Registrant's 15,339 employees are located worldwide. They perform the vital
functions of analyzing the nature of changing demands for information and of
channeling the resources necessary to fill those demands. By virtue of the
numerous copyrights and licensing, trade, and other agreements, which are
essential to such a business, the Registrant is able to collect, compile, and
disseminate this information. Substantially all book manufacturing and magazine
printing is handled through a number of independent contractors. The
Registrant's principal raw material is paper, and the Registrant has assured
sources of supply, at competitive prices, adequate for its business needs.

Descriptions of the company's principal products, broad services and markets,
and significant achievements are hereby incorporated by reference from Exhibit
