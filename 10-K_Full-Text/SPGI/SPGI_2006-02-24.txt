Item 1a.

Risk Factors

As required the Company is providing the following cautionary statements
which identify factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to
differ materially from historical and expected results. It is not possible
to foresee or identify all such factors. Investors should not consider this
list an exhaustive statement of all risks and uncertainties.

•

Historical Growth Rates

Continuance of the Company’s historical growth rate depends upon a
number of uncertain events including the outcome of the Company’s
strategies of expanding its penetration in global markets, introduction
of new products and services, and acquisitions. Difficulties, delays or
failure of the Company’s strategies could cause the future growth of the
Company to differ materially from its historical growth rate.

•

Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or
Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other
Volatility in the Financial Markets

The Company’s results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the
volume of debt securities issued in domestic and/or global capital
markets. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either
reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’
willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number
and dollar volume of debt issuance for which Standard & Poor’s provides
ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates or credit
spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate
environment, significant



political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other
market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of
debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of
borrowers, and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered.
A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s results.



have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and
the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of
credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. In
addition, European Union member states are in the process of
implementing the European Commission’s Market Abuse Directive which,
depending on how the Directive is implemented, could affect rating
agencies’ communications with issuers as part of the rating process.
Local, national and multinational bodies have considered and adopted
other legislation and regulations relating to credit rating agencies
from time to time and are likely to continue to do so in the future.
The Company does not believe that any new or currently proposed
legislation, regulations or judicial determinations would have a
materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
operations. However, new legislation, regulations or judicial
determinations applicable to credit rating agencies in the United States
and abroad could affect the competitive position of Standard & Poor’s
ratings services. Additional information on the SEC’s activities
regarding rating agencies is provided in the Management’s Discussion and
Analysis section of the Company’s 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

A writ of summons was served on The McGraw-Hill Companies, SRL and on The
McGraw-Hill Companies, SA (both indirect subsidiaries of the Company) on
September 29, 2005 and October 7, 2005, respectively, in an action brought
in the tribunal of Milan, Italy by Enrico Bondi (“Bondi”), the
Extraordinary Commissioner of Parmalat Finanziaria S.p.A. and Parmalat
S.p.A. (collectively, “Parmalat”). Bondi has brought numerous other
lawsuits in both Italy and the United States against entities and
individuals who had dealings with Parmalat. In this suit, Bondi claims that
Standard & Poor’s, which had issued investment grade ratings of Parmalat
until shortly before Parmalat’s collapse in December 2003, breached its
duty to issue an independent and professional rating and negligently and
knowingly assigned inflated ratings in order to retain Parmalat’s business.
Alleging joint and several liability, Bondi claims damages of Euros
4,073,984,120 (representing the value of bonds issued by Parmalat and the
rating fees paid by Parmalat) with interest, plus damages to be ascertained
for Standard & Poor’s alleged complicity in aggravating Parmalat’s
financial difficulties and/or for having contributed in bringing about
Parmalat’s indebtedness towards its bondholders, and legal fees. The
Company believes that Bondi’s allegations and claims for damages lack legal
or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action.

In addition, in the normal course of business both in the United States and
abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal
proceedings and are involved, from time to time, in governmental and
self-regulatory agency proceedings, which may result in adverse judgments,
damages, fines or penalties. Also, various governmental and self-regulatory
agencies regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Based on information
currently known by the Company’s management, the Company does not believe
that any pending legal, governmental or self-regulatory proceedings or
investigations will result in a material adverse effect on its financial
condition or results of operations.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief
Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

As of December 31, 2005, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and
with the participation of the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management,
including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of December 31, 2005.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Section 404) and as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
management is required to provide the following report on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting:

1.

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
Company.

2.

The Company’s management has evaluated the system of
internal control using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) framework. Management has selected the COSO
framework for its evaluation as it is a control framework recognized by the
SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that is free from
bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative
measurement of the Company’s internal controls, is sufficiently complete so
that relevant controls are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of
internal controls over financial reporting.



3.

Based on management’s evaluation under this framework, we
have concluded that the Company’s internal controls over financial
reporting were effective as of December 31, 2005. There are no material
weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that
have been identified by management.

4.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
firm, Ernst & Young LLP, have audited the consolidated financial statements
of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2005, and have issued their
reports on the financial statements and management’s assessment as to the
effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting under Auditing
Standard No. 2 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. These
reports are located on pages 67 and 68 of the 2005 Annual Report to
Shareholders.

Other Matters

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial
reporting during the most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

Included in this number are 42,191,062 shares to be issued upon exercise
of outstanding options under the Company’s Stock Incentive Plans and 174,038
deferred units already credited but to be issued under the Director Deferred Stock
Ownership Plan.

(2)

Included in this number are 566,848 shares reserved for issuance under
the Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan. The remaining 19,114,568 shares are
reserved for issuance under the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2002 Plan”) for
Performance Stock, Restricted Stock, Other Stock-Based Awards, Nonqualified Stock
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”).

(3)

Under the terms of the 2002 Plan, shares subject to an award (other than
a stock option, SAR, or dividend equivalent) or shares paid in settlement of a
dividend equivalent reduce the number of shares available under the 2002 Plan by
one share for each such share granted or paid; shares subject to a stock option or
SAR reduce the number of shares available under the 2002 Plan by one-third of a
share for each such share granted. The 2002 Plan stipulates that in no case, as a
result of such share counting, may more than 19,000,000 shares of stock be issued
thereunder. Accordingly, for purposes of setting forth the figures in this column,
the base figure from which issuances of stock awards are deducted, is deemed to be
19,000,000 shares for the 2002 Plan plus shares reserved for grant immediately
prior to the amendments to the 2002 Plan of April 28, 2004.

The 2002 Plan is also governed by certain share recapture provisions. The
aggregate number of shares of stock available under the 2002 Plan for issuance
are increased by the number of shares of stock granted as an award under the
2002 Plan or 1993 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “1993 Plan”)(other than
stock option, SAR or 1993 Plan stock option awards) or by one-third of the
number of shares of stock in the case of



stock option, SAR or 1993 Plan stock option awards that are, in each case:
forfeited, settled in cash or property other than stock, or otherwise not
distributable under an award under the Plan; tendered or withheld to pay the
exercise or purchase price of an award under the 2002 or 1993 Plans or to
satisfy applicable wage or other required tax withholding in connection with the
exercise, vesting or payment of, or other event related to, an award under the
2002 or 1993 Plan; or repurchased by the Company with the option proceeds in
respect of the exercise of a stock option under the 2002 or 1993 Plans.
