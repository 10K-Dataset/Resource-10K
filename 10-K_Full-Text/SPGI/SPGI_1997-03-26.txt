Item 1.   Business
- -------   --------

The Registrant, incorporated in December 1925, serves business, professional and
educational markets around the world with information products and services. Key
markets include finance, business, education, construction, medical and health,
computers and communications, aerospace and defense. As a multimedia publishing
and information company, the Registrant employs a broad range of media,
including books, magazines, newsletters, software, on-line data services,
CD-ROMs, facsimile and television broadcasting. Most of the Registrant's
products and services face substantial competition from a variety of sources.

The Registrant's 16,220 employees are located worldwide. They perform the vital
functions of analyzing the nature of changing demands for information and of
channeling the resources necessary to fill those demands. By virtue of the
numerous copyrights and licensing, trade, and other agreements, which are
essential to such a business, the Registrant is able to collect, compile, and
disseminate this information. All book manufacturing and magazine printing is
handled through a number of independent contractors. The Registrant's principal
raw material is paper, and the Registrant has assured sources of supply, at
competitive prices, adequate for its business needs.

Descriptions of the company's principal products, broad services and markets,
and significant achievements are hereby incorporated by reference from Exhibit
(13), pages 4 to 21 and pages 24 to 25 (textual material) of the Registrant's
1996 Annual Report to Shareholders.

                                       -2-




The Registrant's major lease covers space in its headquarters building in New
York City. The building is owned by Rock-McGraw, Inc., a corporation in which
the Registrant and Rockefeller Group, Inc. are the sole shareholders. The
Registrant occupies approximately 830,000 square feet of the rentable space
under a 30-year lease expiring June 30, 2002, which includes renewal options for
two additional 15-year periods. In addition, the Registrant subleases for its
own account approximately 708,000 square feet of space for periods up to 25
years.

                                       -3-

The largest complex owned by the Registrant is located in Hightstown, NJ which
houses the offices for accounting operations, data processing services, other
service departments and a warehouse. The Registrant has consolidated its
domestic book distribution operations by consolidating the distribution
operations in Blue Ridge Summit, PA and Hightstown, NJ to Westerville and
Blacklick, OH. The company also has a warehouse in Dubuque, IA that was acquired
with the Times Mirror Higher Education Group in October 1996. The warehouse in
Hightstown, NJ is leased to a tenant. The warehouse in Blue Ridge Summit, PA is
vacant.

The Registrant leases approximately 75 percent of a building in Burr Ridge,
Illinois. The building is owned by Burr Ridge Parkway Limited Partnership, in
which the Registrant has a 50 percent ownership interest. The leased space is
occupied by the higher education business that was acquired by the Registrant in
October, 1996 from Times Mirror. The Registrant has the option to sell its
interest in the limited partnership in January 1998 to Times Mirror for $10.5
million.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
- -------  -----------------

         In Item 1 of Part II of Registrant's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
         June 30, 1996, Registrant reported that a Complaint had been filed on
         June 11, 1996 in the United States Bankruptcy Court, Central District
         of California, in an action captioned County of Orange v. McGraw-Hill
         Companies, Inc.,                      -------------------------------
         -----------------
         d/b/a Standard & Poor's (Case No. SA 94-22272-JR; Adversary No. SA
         ----------------------- 
         96-01624- JR). The Complaint alleges that Standard & Poor's breached
         its contracts with Orange County, was professionally negligent and
         aided and abetted the County's officers in breaching their fiduciary
         duty by, inter alia,
                  ----- ----

         assigning unduly high ratings to debt instruments issued by the County
         and by failing to advise the County's Board of Supervisors of the
         illegal acts being committed by the County's officers. On October 17,
         1996, the United States District Court, Central District of California,
         granted Registrant's motion to withdraw the Bankruptcy Court reference.
         The action was transferred to the United States District Court for the
         Central District of California (Case No. SA CV 96-765-GLT) upon the
         filing on December 4, 1996 of the Bankruptcy Court's ruling on
         Registrant's motion to dismiss the Complaint. In that ruling, the
         Bankruptcy Court granted Registrant's motion to dismiss the County's
         aiding and abetting claim, but denied it as to the breach of contract
         and professional negligence claims. The Bankruptcy Court's ruling will
         be reviewed de novo by the District Court. The
                     -- ----
         Registrant continues to believe that the allegations of the Complaint
         lack merit and intends to vigorously contest the action.
