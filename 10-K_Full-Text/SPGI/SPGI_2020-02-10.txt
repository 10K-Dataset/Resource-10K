PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

S&P Global Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading  provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide.  The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, trading firms and issuers; and the commodity markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, petrochemicals and agriculture. We serve our global customers through a broad range of products and services available through both third-party and proprietary distribution channels. We were incorporated in December of 1925 under the laws of the state of New York.

Our Businesses

Our operations consist of four reportable segments: S&P Global Ratings ("Ratings"), S&P Global Market Intelligence ("Market Intelligence"), S&P Global Platts ("Platts") and S&P Dow Jones Indices ("Indices"). For a discussion on the competitive conditions in our businesses, see “MD&A – Segment Review” contained in Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the contract obligations for revenue from Kensho Technologies Inc.’s (“Kensho”) major customers were transferred to Market Intelligence for fulfillment.  As a result of this transfer, from January 1, 2019 revenue from contracts with Kensho’s customers is reflected in Market Intelligence’s results.  In 2018, the revenue from contracts with Kensho’s customers was reported in Corporate revenue. See Note 2 –

Acquisitions and Divestitures

to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8,

Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Ratings

Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics to investors, issuers and other market participants. Credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the debt issue may default.

With offices in over 25 countries around the world, Ratings is an important part of the world's financial infrastructure and has played a leading role for over 150 years in providing investors with information and independent benchmarks for their investment and financial decisions as well as access to the capital markets. The key constituents Ratings serves are investors, corporations, governments, municipalities, commercial and investment banks, insurance companies, asset managers, and other debt issuers.

As the capital markets continue to evolve, Ratings is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities, driven by continuing regulatory changes, through its global network, well-established position in corporate markets and strong investor reputation.

Ratings disaggregates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:

•

ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, as well as structured finance debt instruments;

•

bank loan ratings; and

•

corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of a company which does not currently have a Ratings credit rating.

Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at CRISIL.

Market Intelligence

Market Intelligence's portfolio of capabilities are designed to help investment professionals, government agencies, corporations and universities track performance, generate alpha, identify investment ideas, understand competitive and industry dynamics, perform evaluations and assess credit risk. Key customers served by Market Intelligence include investment managers, investment



banks, private equity firms, insurance companies, commercial banks, corporations, professional services firms, government agencies and regulators.

Market Intelligence includes the following business lines:

•

Desktop

—

a product suite that provides data, analytics and third-party research for global finance professionals, which includes the Market Intelligence Desktop (which are inclusive of the S&P Capital IQ and SNL Desktop products);

•

Data Management Solutions

—

integrated bulk data feeds and application programming interfaces that can be customized, which includes Compustat, GICS, Point In Time Financials and CUSIP; and

•

Credit Risk Solutions

—

commercial arm that sells Ratings' credit ratings and related data, analytics and research, which includes subscription-based offerings, RatingsDirect® and RatingsXpress®; and Credit Analytics.

Subscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily derived from distribution of data, analytics, third-party research, and credit ratings-related information primarily through web-based channels, including Market Intelligence Desktop, RatingsDirect®, RatingsXpress®, and Credit Analytics. Non-subscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily related to certain advisory, pricing and analytical services.

Platts

Platts is the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets. Platts provides essential price data, analytics, and industry insight enabling the commodity and energy markets to perform with greater transparency and efficiency. Key customers served by Platts include producers, traders and intermediaries within the energy, petrochemicals, metals and agriculture markets.

Platts' revenue is generated primarily through the following sources:

•

Subscription revenue

—

primarily from subscriptions to our real-time news, market data and price assessments, along with other information products;

•

Sales usage-based royalties

—

primarily from licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges; and

•

Non-subscription revenue

—

conference sponsorship, consulting engagements, and events.

Indices

Indices is a global index provider maintaining a wide variety of indices to meet an array of investor needs. Indices’ mission is to provide transparent benchmarks to help with decision making, collaborate with the financial community to create innovative products, and provide investors with tools to monitor world markets.

Indices primarily derives revenue from asset-linked fees based on the S&P and Dow Jones indices and to a lesser extent generates subscription revenue and transaction revenue. Specifically, Indices generates revenue from the following sources:

•

Investment vehicles

—

asset-linked fees such as exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) and mutual funds, that are based on S&P Dow Jones Indices' benchmarks that generate revenue through fees based on assets and underlying funds;

•

Exchange traded derivatives

—

generate sales usage-based royalties based on trading volumes of derivatives contracts listed on various exchanges;

•

Index-related licensing fees

—

fixed or variable annual and per-issue asset-linked fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products; and

•

Data and customized index subscription fees

—

fees from supporting index fund management, portfolio analytics and research.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered.  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.  These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.

We operate in the capital and commodities markets. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, trading firms, and issuers; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, petrochemicals and agriculture. Certain risk factors are applicable to certain of our individual segments while other risk factors are applicable Company-wide.

Changes in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic and/or global capital markets, asset levels and flows into investment products, changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets, and volatility in the commodities markets impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

Our business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the United States and world financial markets.

•

Economic conditions and volatility across the globe are generally affected by negative or uncertain economic and political conditions.  In addition, natural and man-made disasters as well as the outbreak pandemic or contagious diseases introduce volatility and uncertainty into the global capital and commodities markets and negatively impact general economic conditions. Volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets, which are increasingly interdependent. Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, increased volatility or an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations.

•

Since a significant component of our credit-rating based revenue is transaction-based, and is essentially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets, unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities tend to reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which Ratings provides credit ratings.

•

Our Indices business is impacted by market volatility, asset levels of investment products tracking indices, and trading volumes of certain exchange traded derivatives. Volatile capital markets, as well as changing investment styles, among other factors, may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an index-linked investment product.

•

Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, the level of derivatives



trading and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

Our Platts business is impacted by volatility in the commodities markets.  Weak economic conditions, especially in our key markets, including the energy industry, could reduce demand for our products, impacting our revenues and margins.  As a result of volatility in commodity prices and trading activity in physical commodities and commodities derivatives, we may encounter difficulty in achieving sustained market acceptance of past or future contract terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

•

Any weakness in the macroeconomic environment could constrain customer budgets across the markets we serve, potentially leading to a reduction in their employee headcount and a decrease in demand for our subscription-based products.

•

The foregoing factors generally affect our performance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information.

•

Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of data and information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors.

•

All of our businesses have access to material non-public information concerning the Company’s customers, including sovereigns, corporate issuers and other third parties around the world, the unauthorized disclosure of which could affect the trading markets for such customers’ securities and could damage such customers’ competitive positions. The cyber risks the Company faces range from cyber attacks common to most industries, to more sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to certain information or systems due in part to our prominence in the global marketplace, such as our ratings on debt issued by sovereigns and corporate issuers, or the composition of our indices. Unauthorized disclosure of this information could cause our customers to lose faith in our ability to protect their confidential information and therefore cause customers to cease doing business with us.

•

We experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. Although there has not been a cyber attack that has had a material adverse effect on the Company to date, there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future.

•

Breaches of our or our vendors’ systems and networks, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber attacks, hacking, computer viruses or malware, employee error, malfeasance, physical breaches or other actions, may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such vendors’ websites, applications or data processing, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding us, our business or our customers.

•

Misappropriation, improper modification, destruction, corruption or unavailability of our data and information due to cyber incidents, attacks or other security breaches could damage our brand and reputation, result in litigation and regulatory actions, and lead to loss of customer confidence in our security measures and reliability, which would harm our ability to retain customers and gain new ones.

•

Although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the enterprise and our customers, clients and employees, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security.

•

Measures that we take to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or become obsolete. While we have not experienced a material incident to date, any material incident could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us, and increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents.

•

Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched.

•

Given the extent to which our businesses are privy to material non-public information concerning our customers, our data could be improperly used, including for insider trading by our employees and third party vendors with access to key systems.  We have experienced insider trading incidents involving employees in the past, and it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or third party vendors. We take precautions to detect and prevent such activity, including implementing and training on insider trading policies for our employees and contractual obligations for our third party



vendors, but such precautions are not guaranteed to deter misconduct.  Any breach of our clients’ confidences as a result of employee or third party vendor misconduct could harm our reputation.

•

The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims.

•

An actual or perceived breach of our security may harm the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and result in damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services.  Media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business.

•

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Changes in the legislative, regulatory, and commercial environments in which we operate may materially and adversely impact our ability to collect, compile, use, and publish data and may impact our financial results.

◦

Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, if despite our best efforts an inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations should occur, this could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.

◦

Certain types of information we collect, compile, use, and publish, including offerings in all our businesses, and particularly our Market Intelligence business, are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, there is increasing concern among certain privacy advocates and government regulators regarding marketing and privacy matters, particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests.

◦

There has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfer, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. The law in these areas continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the U.S., the European Union (“EU”) and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal and sensitive information of our employees, vendors and customers.

◦

The EU's comprehensive General Data Privacy Regulation (the “GDPR”) became fully effective in 2018. GDPR requires companies to satisfy requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves.

◦

Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. GDPR and other similar laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.

◦

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) became fully effective January 1, 2020, requiring, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information.  The CCPA provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties.

◦

Our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party’s information technology systems. Such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability.

◦

Compliance with the GDPR, the CCPA and other current and future applicable international and U.S. privacy, cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and time-consuming. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.

◦

In addition, other jurisdictions, including China, are considering imposing or have already imposed additional restrictions. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which could result in greater compliance risk and cost for us.

◦

Continued privacy concerns may result in new or amended laws and regulations. Future laws and regulations with respect to the collection, compilation, use, and publication of information and consumer privacy could result in limitations on our operations, increased compliance or litigation expense, adverse publicity, or loss of revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. It is also possible that we could be prohibited from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs.



◦

We may also from time to time be subject to, or face assertions that we are subject to, additional obligations relating to personal data by contract or due to assertions that self-regulatory obligations or industry standards apply to our practices.

Exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

In the normal course of business, both in the United States and abroad, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries, as discussed under Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 13 -

Commitments and Contingencies

to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8,

Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we face the risk that additional proceedings, investigations and inquiries will arise in the future.

•

Many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the activity of our Ratings, Indices, and Platts businesses. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to our regulated activities and antitrust matters.

•

Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

In view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of the matters we are currently facing or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that the outcome of the matters we are currently facing or that we may face in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we continuously review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business and competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.

•

Legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the Company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues.

•

Risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the United States. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations against the Company in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

We may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Increasing regulation of our Ratings business in the United States, Europe and elsewhere can increase our costs of doing business and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

The financial services industry is highly regulated, rapidly evolving and subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. The businesses conducted by Ratings are in certain cases regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the “Reform Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.

•

In the past several years, the U.S. Congress, the International Organization of Securities Commissions ("IOSCO"), the SEC and the European Commission, including through the European Securities Market Authority ("ESMA"), as well as regulators in other countries in which Ratings operates, have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies.

•

These laws and regulations, and any future rule-making, could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs, which we may be unable to pass through to customers. In addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. We may be required to incur significant expenses in order to comply with such laws and regulations and to mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions. Legal proceedings



could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability. It is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on our business and our customers’ businesses, and they may affect Ratings’ communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which Ratings’ ratings are developed, affect the manner in which Ratings or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business. Each of these developments increases the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized.

Additional information regarding rating agencies is provided under Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Indices and Platts businesses are subject to a new and evolving regulatory regimes in Europe and the potential for increased or changing regulations in the United States and elsewhere.  Our Indices business is subject to a new regulatory regime in Australia.  Our Indices, Market Intelligence and Platts businesses are subject to additional regulation in Europe and our Market Intelligence business is subject to investment advisory regulation in the United States and Europe. This changing regulatory landscape can increase our exposure, compliance risk and costs of doing business globally and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

In addition to the extensive and evolving U.S. laws and regulations, foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of the financial services and commodities industries.

•

In October of 2012, IOSCO issued its Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies ("PRA Principles"), which IOSCO states are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments that are referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members. Platts has taken steps to align its operations with the PRA Principles and, as recommended by IOSCO in its final report on the PRA Principles, has aligned to the PRA Principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks.

•

In July of 2013, IOSCO issued its Principles for Financial Benchmarks ("Financial Benchmark Principles"), which are intended to promote the reliability of the benchmark determination process by setting standards related to benchmark governance, benchmark quality, transparency and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices and benchmarks published by Indices. Indices has taken steps to align its governance regime, control framework and operations with the Financial Benchmark Principles and engages an independent auditor to perform an annual reasonable assurance review of its adherence to the Financial Benchmark Principles.

•

The benchmark industry is subject to regulation in the EU (the “EU Benchmark Regulation”) as well as potential increased regulation of financial benchmarks in other jurisdictions.  The EU Benchmark Regulation was published on June 30, 2016, with provisions applicable to Indices and Platts, effective from January 1, 2018. ESMA has published additional guidance clarifying that existing benchmark administrators such as Indices and Platts may utilize the transitional provisions contained in the EU Benchmark Regulation, which provides them two (2) years to implement and seek authorization by an EU National Competent Authority by January 1, 2020, with their respective benchmark activities in Europe. This legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations, greater compliance risk and costs for Indices and Platts but they are not expected to be material at this time, although the exact impact remains unclear.

•

Indices is subject to the new benchmark regulation in Australia under which it is required to obtain a license from and be subject to the supervision of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission regarding its administration of the S&P ASX 200 index. This legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations, greater compliance risk and costs for Indices but they are not expected to be material at this time, although the exact impact remains unclear.

•

The EU's package of legislative measures called the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation (collectively "MiFID II") entered into force in 2014, revising and updating the prior Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2004) and its associated secondary legislation.  The substantive provisions of MiFID II apply in all EU Member States since 2018. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things: (i) mandate conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks for the purposes of clearing related securities and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses for this purpose; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venues that are subject to regulation; (iv) require the unbundling of investment research from other services, including execution services, and direct that investment firms must pay for research either out of a dedicated research payment account which is paid for by clients or from the investment firm’s profits; and (v) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the EU Market Infrastructure Regulation of 2011, or EMIR).  The MiFID II package may result in changes to the manner in which S&P Dow Jones Indices and Platts license their indices and price assessments, respectively, and could also have an indirect impact on the credit ratings and third-party research products offered by other divisions of the Company for use within the EU. MiFID II and the Market Abuse Regulation (“MAR”) may impose



additional regulatory burdens on the activities of S&P Dow Jones Indices and Platts in the EU, although the exact impact and costs are not yet known.

•

Market Intelligence operates regulated investment advisory businesses in the United States and the European Union. This business and other Market Intelligence businesses may increasingly become subject to new or more stringent regulations that will increase the cost of doing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our international business activities must comport with U.S. international trade restraints, including economic sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls.

•

As a global company headquartered in the U.S., we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including economic sanction laws. These laws include prohibitions or restrictions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons and entities.

•

Embargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. These embargoes and sanctions laws may affect our ability to continue to market and/or sell our products and services into these geographies and in turn adversely impact our revenue from such geographies.

•

Additional international trade restraints may be promulgated at any time and may require changes to our operations and increase our risk of noncompliance.

•

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in significant fines and penalties and related material adverse effects on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results.

•

We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen our business and grow our Company.  Such transactions present significant challenges and risks.

•

The market for acquisition targets and other strategic transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect our ability to complete such transactions.

•

If we are unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

•

If such transactions are completed, the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. For instance, the process of integration may require more resources than anticipated, we may assume unintended liabilities, there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures, we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business and such transactions may divert management’s focus from other business operations.

•

The failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients.

•

Some of our products support the investment processes  and other activities of our clients, which, in the aggregate, manage trillions of dollars of assets. Use of our products as part of such activities, including the investment process creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

The products we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects, despite testing and/or other quality assurance practices.  Such errors may exist during any part of a product’s life cycle and may persist notwithstanding testing and/or other quality assurance practices.  Deploying products containing such errors may damage our reputation and the costs associated with remediating such errors may have an impact on our profitability.

•

Further, certain of our products rely on proprietary methodologies, models and processes that are subject to various internal governance and control frameworks. Despite ongoing review and quality assurance processes, these methodologies, models and processes as well as their respective inputs may also contain undetected errors or defects that may damage our reputation and the costs associated with remediating such errors may have an impact on our profitability.

•

Any claim relating to our products, even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us, would involve a significant commitment of our management, personnel, financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation. In addition, such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.



Increased competition could result in a loss of market share or revenue.

•

The markets for credit ratings, financial research, investment advisory services, market data, index-based products, and commodities price assessments and related news and information about these markets are intensely competitive. Ratings, Market Intelligence, Platts and Indices compete domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of their offerings, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation.

•

While our businesses face competition from traditional content and analytics providers (including exchanges), we also face competition from non-traditional providers, such as asset managers, investment banks and technology-led companies that are adding content and analytics capabilities to their core businesses.

•

In addition, in some of the countries in which Ratings competes, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers.

•

Sustained downward pressure on oil and other commodities prices and trading activity in those markets could have a material adverse effect on the rate of growth of Platts’ revenue, including subscription and licensing fees.

Introduction of new or enhanced products and services could impact our profitability.

•

We operate in highly competitive markets that continue to change to adapt to customer needs.

•

In order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new offerings and enhancements, including new ways to deliver our products and services.

•

These new or enhanced offerings resulting from our investments may not achieve market acceptance, may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically.

•

We could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment in which we operate.

Our ability to develop, adapt, or implement new and improved processes and technology may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

The rapid change of technology is a key feature of all of the markets in which we operate. To succeed in the future, we will need to deploy improved processes and technology to innovate, design, develop, assemble, test, market, and support new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and cost-effective manner.

•

Innovation and constant development in support of new products and enhancements to existing products calls for the implementation of new and improved processes and technologies that require related change management efforts.

While we employ a certain level of internal and external resources to mitigate the risks associated with implementing process and technology improvements, we may face unexpected challenges in execution that may require more management attention than expected, thus diverting management time and energy from other businesses.  The foregoing and other unforeseen factors could also result in business being disrupted for a period of time as well as additional commitments of financial resources.

A significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.

•

Our major expenditures include employee compensation and capital investments.

•

We offer competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses. Compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including those affecting the cost of health insurance and postretirement benefits, and any trends specific to the employee skill sets we require.

•

We make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives and we cannot provide assurances that such investments will result in increased revenues.

•

Although we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans, there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability of these investments.

Increased availability of free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

In recent years, more public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become available, particularly through the Internet, and advances in public cloud computing and open source software may continue.

•

Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information can reduce demand for our products and services. Demand could also be reduced as a result of cost-cutting initiatives at certain companies and organizations. Although we believe



our products are enhanced by our analysis, tools and applications, our financial results may be adversely affected if our customers choose to use these public sources as a substitute for our products or services.

Consolidation of customers as well as staffing levels across our customer base could impact our available markets and revenue growth.

•

Our businesses have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the corporate, financial services and commodities industries. The consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions across these industries can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size of our customer base.

•

Our customers that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on our products and services. If a large number of smaller customers or a critical number of larger customers reduce their spending with us, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

•

Alternatively, customers may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial and commodity market products and services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors, including by selecting other vendors with lower-cost offerings, or by self-sourcing their need for financial and commodity market products and services. If customers elect to consolidate their spending on financial and commodity market products and services with other vendors and not us, if we lose business to lower priced competitors, or if customers elect to self-source their product and service needs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

•

A material portion of our revenues in our Indices business is concentrated in some of our largest customers, who have significant assets under management in index funds and exchange-traded funds. A loss of a substantial portion of revenue from our largest customers could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

If we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed, we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire.

•

Our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers, including certain data, software and service suppliers. Some of our products and their related value are dependent upon updates from our data suppliers and most of our information and data products are dependent upon continuing access to historical and current data.

•

We utilize certain data provided by third-party data sources in a variety of ways, including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world.

•

If the data from our suppliers has errors, is delayed, has design defects, is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

Some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice. Termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from, or restricted use of, or litigation in connection with, a data provider’s information could decrease the available information for us to use (and offer our clients) and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position.

•

We consider many of our products and services to be proprietary.  Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm the value of and revenue generated by such assets as well as our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively.  Businesses we acquire may also have intellectual property portfolios which increase the complexity of managing our intellectual property portfolio and protecting our competitive position.

•

Our products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of digital and other media. Our ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property rights against infringement and misappropriation. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets.  For example, we do business in a number of countries included on the Priority Watch List maintained by the  Office of the United States Trade Representative and which are currently thought to afford less protection to intellectual property rights generally than some other jurisdictions. The lack of strong patent and other intellectual property protection in jurisdictions such as  referenced above may significantly increase our vulnerability as regards unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property and undermine our competitive position.

•

Our products also contain intellectual property of third party sources.  Any violation by us of the intellectual property rights of such third parties could result in termination of the relevant source agreement, litigation and reputational damage which could materially and adversely affects our business, financial condition or results of operations.



Recent and future legislation, regulatory reform or policy changes under the current U.S. administration could have a material effect on our business and results of operations.

Legislation, regulatory reform or policy changes under the current U.S. administration, such as financial services regulatory reform, U.S. oil deregulation, government-sponsored enterprise reform and increased infrastructure spending and significant changes in trade policy (including sanctions), could impact our business.  Any of the forgoing changes could impact our results of operations and cash flows directly; such changes may also impact our business by creating increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial and commodities markets. At this time, we cannot predict the scope or nature of these changes or assess what the overall effect of such potential changes could be on our results of operations or cash flows.

•

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) enacted in 2017 in the United States significantly changed the tax rules applicable to U.S. domiciled corporations.  Changes such as lower corporate tax rates, full expensing for qualified property, taxation of offshore earnings, limitations on interest expense deductions, and changes to the municipal bond tax exemption may impact demand for our products and services.  While lower than usual issuance following effectiveness of the TCJA initially impacted our business, at this time, we cannot assess what the overall effect of such legislation could be on our results of operations or cash flows over the longer term.  In addition, the TCJA is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state tax authorities, and the TCJA could be subject to amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase the impacts of the TCJA.

Regulatory changes and economic conditions leading up to and following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

•

Voters in the United Kingdom ("UK") approved an exit from the EU via a referendum in 2016 and in 2017, the UK invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on the EU, commencing the process to leave the EU (“Brexit”) and on January 31, 2020, the UK formally exited the EU.  Negotiations on the terms of the UK’s future relationship with the EU are ongoing. The UK is expected to enter a transition period until December 31, 2020 permitting negotiation of a free trade deal.  The consequences for the economies of the UK and EU member states as a result of the UK's withdrawal from the EU remain unknown and unpredictable.

•

Any impact from Brexit on the Company will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade and other negotiations. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the UK and the EU as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate and the EU determines how to treat regulated activities (e.g., the activities of credit rating agencies) originating in the UK. Our businesses are subject to increasing regulation of the financial services and commodities industries in Europe. Potential changes in EU regulation and/or additional regulation in the UK could cause additional operating obligations and increased costs for our businesses.  In particular, our Ratings business will, for the first time, be subject to regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority effective January 1, 2021.

•

Changes to UK immigration policy as a result of Brexit could adversely affect our ability to retain talent for our European operations.

•

Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  The lack of certainty given the pending negotiations creates the risk that notwithstanding that we have devoted valuable resources to a thorough preparation for the impact of Brexit on our European operations, we may not be adequately prepared for an unforeseen outcome.

Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.

•

Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, outbreak of pandemic or contagious diseases (including, but not limited to, 2019 Novel Coronavirus, Ebola, Zika, avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1 (swine flu) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), security breach, cyber attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our ability to continue to operate will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. In such an event, we could experience operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel, that could have a material adverse effect on our business.

•

We regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially



interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.

Outsourcing certain aspects of our business could result in disruption and increased costs.

•

We have outsourced certain functions to third-party service providers to leverage leading specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies. Outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not perform to our standards or legal requirements, may not produce reliable results, may not perform in a timely manner, may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or may fail to perform at all. Failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could result in material financial loss, higher costs, regulatory actions and reputational harm.

•

Outsourcing these functions also involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of our confidential information and data.  Failure of these third parties to maintain these safeguards could result in unauthorized access to our systems or a system or network disruption that could lead to improper disclosure of confidential information or data, regulatory penalties and remedial costs.

•

We also rely on the business infrastructure and systems of third parties with whom we do business and to whom we outsource the maintenance and development of operational and technological functionality, including third-party cloud infrastructure. Our cloud infrastructure providers, or other service providers, could experience system breakdowns or failures, outages, downtime, cyber attacks, adverse changes to financial condition, bankruptcy or other adverse conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. Thus, our plans to increase the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to “the cloud” or to other third parties may increase our risk exposure.

We rely heavily on network systems and the Internet and any failures or disruptions may adversely affect our ability to serve our customers.

•

Many of our products and services are delivered electronically, and our customers rely on our ability to process transactions rapidly and deliver substantial quantities of data on computer-based networks. Our customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems, our websites and the Internet.

•

Our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party Internet providers or increased government regulation.

•

Delays in our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers. In addition, a number of our customers entrust us with storing and securing their data and information on our servers.

•

Although we have disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities for our primary data centers, our systems are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective. As such, these disruptions may affect our ability to store, handle and secure such data and information.

Our operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

Our ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located, including New York City, the location of our headquarters, and major cities worldwide in which we have offices.

•

This may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure used by us or third parties with or through whom we conduct business, whether due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, war or otherwise. Our efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of our major operating systems may not be successful.

•

We rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings. We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems.

•

We also do not have fully redundant systems for most of our smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of our locations or systems and our personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or



communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons’ ability to service and interact with our clients and customers may suffer.

•

We cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to our operations or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Inability to attract and retain key qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

•

The development, maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge, experience and ability of our highly skilled, educated and trained employees.  Accordingly, our business is dependent on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. If the Company is less successful in its recruiting efforts, or if it is unable to retain key employees, its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services or achieve strategic goals may be adversely affected.

Our reputation, credibility, and brand are key assets and competitive advantages of our Company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.

•

Our reputation, credibility, and the strength of our brand are key competitive strengths.

•

Given our role in the financial and commodities markets, our ability to attract and retain customers is uniquely affected by external perceptions of our reputation, credibility, and brand.

•

Negative perceptions or publicity could damage our reputation with customers, prospects, regulators, and the public generally, which could negatively impact, among other things, our ability to attract and retain customers, employees and suppliers, as well as suitable candidates for acquisition or other combinations.

•

Damage to our reputation, credibility, and brand could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our expansion into and investments in new markets may not be successful.

•

We believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our business into major geographic and product markets (including China and ESG) and we are in the process of such expansion efforts. Expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment and attention from management. There can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations.

•

The geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance and reputational risks. These include, among others, risks relating to:

▪

economic and political conditions around the world,

▪

inflation,

▪

fluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates,

▪

limitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S. subsidiaries,

▪

differing accounting principles and standards,

▪

unexpected increases in taxes or changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws,

▪

potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations (including tax systems) administered by foreign government agencies, some of which may conflict with U.S. or other sources of law,

▪

changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements,

▪

the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions,

▪

competition with local rating agencies that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions, and

▪

civil unrest, terrorism, unstable governments and legal systems, and other factors.

Adverse developments in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.



•

Additionally, we are subject to complex U.S., European and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations abroad, including trade sanctions laws, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010, anti-money laundering laws, and other financial crimes laws.  Our internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs related to these topics may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations.  A determination that we have violated such laws could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, or restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

Embargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. These embargoes and sanctions laws may affect our ability to continue to market and/or sell our products and services into these geographies. In addition, while we have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions, violations of these laws or sanctions could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

Major Portfolio Changes

The following significant change was recently made to our portfolio in January of 2020:

•

In January of 2020, we completed the acquisition of the ESG Ratings Business from RobecoSAM, which includes the widely followed SAM* Corporate Sustainability Assessment, an annual evaluation of companies' sustainability practices. The acquisition will bolster our position as the premier resource for essential environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") insights and product solutions for our customers. Through this acquisition, we will be able to offer our customers even more transparent, robust and comprehensive ESG solutions.

The following significant change was made to our portfolio during the three years ended

December 31, 2019

:

•

In April of 2018, we acquired Kensho Technologies Inc. ("Kensho") for approximately $550 million, net of cash acquired, in a mix of cash and stock. Kensho is a leading-edge provider of next-generation analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data visualization systems to Wall Street's premier global banks and investment institutions, as well as the National Security community. Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the contract obligations for revenue from Kensho's major customers were transferred to Market Intelligence for fulfillment.  As a result of this transfer, from January 1, 2019



revenue from contracts with Kensho’s customers is reflected in Market Intelligence’s results.  In 2018, the revenue from contracts with Kensho’s customers was reported in Corporate revenue.

Revenue increased

7%

, with an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point from foreign exchange rates. The increase was driven by revenue growth at all of our reportable segments. Revenue growth at Ratings was driven by an increase in corporate bond ratings revenue and public finance revenue, partially offset by lower bank loan ratings revenue. The increase at Market Intelligence was  driven by annualized contract value growth in the Market Intelligence Desktop, Credit Risk Solutions and Data Management Solutions products. The increase at Indices was due to higher levels of assets under management for exchange traded funds ("ETFs") and mutual funds. Revenue growth at Indices was also favorably impacted by the buyout of the balance of intellectual property rights in a family of indices from one of our co-marketing and index development partners in the fourth quarter of 2018, retrospective fees for previously unlicensed and unreported index usage and benefits related to recent contract renegotiation. The increase at Platts was primarily due to continued demand for market data and price assessment products.

Operating profit increased

16%

, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of less than 1 percentage point. Excluding the impact of higher legal settlement expenses in 2018 of 3 percentage points, a gain on our dispositions of 2 percentage points and higher Kensho retention related expense in 2018 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 10%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth at all of our reportable segments, lower professional fees and decreased expenses at Corporate Unallocated driven by a $20 million reduction in contributions made to the S&P Global Foundation in 2018. These increases to operating profit were partially offset by higher technology costs, an increase in incentive costs and higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and additional headcount.


Revenue increased

3%

with a 1 percentage point favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Revenue growth was driven by increases at Market Intelligence, Indices and Platts, partially offset by a decrease at Ratings. The increase at Market Intelligence was driven by annualized contract value growth in the Market Intelligence Desktop and Credit Risk Solutions products. Revenue growth at Indices was driven by higher levels of assets under management for ETFs and mutual funds, and higher exchange-traded derivative volumes. The increase at Platts was due to continued demand for market data and price assessment products. These increases were partially offset by a decrease at Ratings driven by lower corporate bond ratings revenue.



Operating profit increased

8%

with a 2 percentage point favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Excluding the unfavorable impact of higher legal settlement expenses in 2018 of less than 1 percentage point, Kensho retention related expense in 2018 of less than 1 percentage point, and higher deal-related amortization in 2018 of less than 1 percentage point, partially offset by the favorable impact of higher employee severance charges in 2017 of less than1 percentage point, the favorable impact of non-cash acquisition and disposition-related adjustments in 2017 of less than 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 8%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth at Market Intelligence, Indices and Platts and decreased compensation costs at Ratings and Corporate primarily driven by reduced incentive costs as well as the decreased headcount from attrition and prior year restructuring actions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue at Ratings, increased expenses at Market Intelligence due to an increase in cost of sales as a result of royalties tied to annualized contract value growth and increased data costs, and higher compensation costs at Market Intelligence and Indices primarily driven by additional headcount.

Risk Factors

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Review

N/M - not meaningful



Revenue




Revenue increased

7%

as compared to


. Subscription revenue increased primarily from growth in Market Intelligence's average contract values and continued demand for Platt's proprietary content. Higher data subscription revenue at Indices also contributed to subscription revenue growth. Non-transaction revenue decreased 1% primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Non-transaction revenue was unfavorably impacted by a decline in Ratings Evaluation Service activity, a decrease at CRISIL, primarily within the risk and analytics sector, and lower entity credit ratings revenue, and benefited from an increase in surveillance revenue and higher royalty revenue. Non-subscription / transaction revenue increased driven by an increase in corporate bond ratings revenue and public finance revenue, partially offset by a decline in bank loan ratings revenue at Ratings. Asset linked fees increased due to the impact of higher levels of assets under management for ETFs and mutual funds at Indices. Additionally, asset-linked fees was favorably impacted by the buyout of the balance of intellectual property rights in a family of indices from one of our co-marketing and index development partners in the fourth quarter of 2018, retrospective fees for previously unlicensed and unreported index usage and benefits related to recent contract renegotiations. The decline in sales-usage based royalties was primarily driven by lower exchange-traded derivative volumes at Indices in 2019. See “Segment Review” below for further information.

The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year.

Operating-related expenses increased as compared to


driven by the acquisition of Kensho in April of 2018 and increases at all of our reportable segments. Ratings increased primarily due to an increase in incentive costs, partially offset by lower professional fees. The increase at Market Intelligence was due to higher technology costs, higher compensation costs and an increase in intersegment royalties tied to annualized contract value growth. Platts increased due to higher compensation costs primarily related to annual merit increases and higher costs to support business initiatives. The increase at Indices was primarily related to increased royalties due to increased traction of royalty-based products and higher compensation costs.

Intersegment eliminations primarily relate to a royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings.

Selling and General Expenses

Selling and general expenses decreased

3%

. Excluding the impact of legal settlement expenses in 2018 of 4 percentage points and higher Kensho retention related expense in 2018 of 1 percentage point, selling and general expenses increased 2%. This increase was primarily driven by an increase at Market Intelligence due to higher compensation and technology costs.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization decreased

$2

million, or

In 2017, selling and general expenses include a charge to exit leased facilities of $19 million and employee severance charges of $10 million.

Operating-Related Expenses

Operating-related expenses remained relatively unchanged as compared to 2017, increasing

$4 million

or less than 1%. Market Intelligence increased due to an increase in cost of sales as a result of royalties tied to annualized contract value growth and increased data costs, and higher compensation costs related to additional headcount. Additionally, operating-related expenses increased due to the acquisition of Kensho in April of 2018. These increases were partially offset by decreased compensation costs at Ratings primarily driven by reduced incentive costs as well as the decreased headcount from attrition and prior year restructuring actions.

Selling and General Expenses

Selling and general expenses decreased 3%. Excluding the favorable impact of higher employee severance charges in 2017 of 59 percentage points, non-cash acquisition and disposition-related adjustments in 2017 of 48 percentage points, higher lease impairment charges in 2017 of 43 percentage points and an asset write-off in 2017 of 7 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of Kensho retention related expense in 2018 of 98 percentage points and higher legal settlement expenses in 2018 of 59 percentage points, selling and general expenses decreased 3%. The decrease is due to decreased compensation costs at Ratings primarily driven by reduced incentive costs, as well as the decreased headcount from attrition and prior year restructuring actions, and a reduction in Corporate Unallocated expense due to a reduction in vacant space, technology spend and professional fees. These decreases were partially offset by higher compensation costs at Market Intelligence and Indices, and increased expenses due to the acquisition of Kensho in April of 2018.

Depreciation and Amortization

This increase was primarily driven by an increase in revenue at all of our reportable segments and lower professional fees, partially offset by higher technology costs, an increase in incentive costs and higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and additional headcount.

Corporate Unallocated

—

Corporate Unallocated includes costs for corporate center functions, select initiatives and unoccupied office space and Kensho, included in selling and general expenses, and Kensho revenue in 2018. Corporate Unallocated improved by

$19 million

or

8%

as compared to


. Excluding the favorable impact of lower Kensho retention related expense in 2019 of 2 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of higher deal-related amortization in 2019 of 1 percentage point, Corporate Unallocated improved 7% primarily driven by a $20 million contribution made by the Company to the S&P Global Foundation in 2018 and a reduction in professional fees.

Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of less than 1 percentage point. The foreign exchange rate impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Constant currency impacts are estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual business' functional currency.


Segment Operating Profit —

Increased $243 million, or 9% as compared to 2017. Excluding the favorable impact of higher employee severance charges in 2017 of 1 percentage point and non-cash acquisition and disposition related adjustments of 1 percentage point, partially offset by the impact of higher legal settlement charges in 2018 of 1 percentage point, segment operating



profit increased 7%. This increase was primarily due to revenue growth at Market Intelligence, Indices and Platts as discussed above and decreased compensation costs at Ratings primarily driven by reduced incentive costs as well as the decreased headcount from attrition and prior year restructuring actions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue at Ratings, increased expenses at Market Intelligence due to an increase in cost of sales as a result of royalties tied to annualized contract value growth and increased data costs, and higher compensation costs at Market Intelligence and Indices primarily driven by additional headcount. See “ – Segment Review” below for further information.

Corporate Unallocated

—

Corporate Unallocated includes costs for corporate center functions, select initiatives and unoccupied office space, included in selling and general expenses, and the results for Kensho in 2018. Corporate Unallocated operating loss increased by

$36 million

or

19%

as compared to 2017. Excluding the unfavorable impact of Kensho retention related expense in 2018 of 17 percentage points, higher deal-related amortization of 12 percentage points, partially offset by higher lease impairment charges in 2017 of 4 percentage points, Corporate Unallocated improved 6% due to a reduction in vacant space, performance related incentive compensation and professional fees.

Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of 2 percentage points. The foreign exchange rate impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Constant currency impacts are estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual business' functional currency.

Other Expense (Income), net

Other expense, net for 2019 was  $98 million and other income, net for 2018 and 2017 was $25 million and $27 million, respectively. Other income (expense), net primarily includes the

net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and postretirement plans

.

During the first quarter of 2019, the Company purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company assumed the Company’s obligation to pay pension benefits to approximately 4,600 retirees and beneficiaries. This purchase eliminates all future investment or mortality risk associated with these retirees. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded with pension plan assets. As a result, the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligation was reduced by approximately $370 million, representing approximately 24% of the total obligations of the Company’s qualified pension plans. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a pre-tax settlement charge of $113 million, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. The Company also recorded pension settlement charges of $5 million and $8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding these charges, other income, net was $14 million, $29 million and $35 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decreases in other income, net in 2019 compared to 2018 and 2018 compared to 2017 were primarily due to a higher loss on investments.

Interest Expense, net

Net interest expense for


increased

$64 million

or

48%

as compared to


, primarily driven by costs associated with the early repayment of our 3.3% Senior Notes and a portion of our 6.55% Senior Notes. Excluding these costs, net interest expense increased

$7 million

or

5%

, driven by the release of reserves for accrued interest related to the resolution of various tax audits in 2018.

Net interest expense for


decreased

$16 million

or

10%

as compared to 2017, driven by the release of reserves for accrued interest related to the resolution of various tax audits in 2018.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate was

21.4%

,

20.9%

and

33.4%

for


,


and


, respectively. The increase in


was primarily due to an increase in accruals for potential tax liabilities for prior years in various jurisdictions. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA"). Additionally, a one-time net tax charge of

$149 million

due to the TCJA was recorded in 2017, which included tax expense of approximately

$173 million

on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and a tax benefit of approximately

$24 million

in respect of the re-valuation of the net U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the reduced corporate income tax rate.



Segment Review

Ratings

Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics to investors, issuers and other market participants. Credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default.

Ratings disaggregates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:

•

ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, as well as structured finance debt instruments;

•

bank loan ratings; and

•

corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of a company which does not currently have a Ratings credit rating.

Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at CRISIL. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings. Royalty revenue for

Revenue increased

8%

, with a 1 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates,  due to an increase in transaction revenue. Transaction revenue increased due to an increase in corporate bond ratings revenue primarily driven by higher corporate bond issuance in the U.S. and Europe mainly resulting from historically low borrowing costs, partially offset by lower bank loan ratings revenue driven by reduced U.S. issuance volumes. An increase in public finance revenue due to increased issuance also contributed to transaction revenue growth. Non-transaction revenue decreased less than 1% primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Non-transaction revenue was unfavorably impacted by a decline in Ratings Evaluation Service activity, a decrease at CRISIL, primarily within the risk and analytics sector, and lower entity credit ratings revenue, and benefited from an increase in surveillance revenue and higher royalty revenue. Transaction and non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories.

Operating profit increased

15%

, with a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of higher legal settlement expenses in 2018 of 5 percentage points, operating profit increased 10%. This increase was primarily due to the increase in revenue discussed above combined with a reduction in legal expenses, lower professional fees from increased leverage on the Global Technology Center and internal resources, partially offset by an increase in incentive costs and AWS cloud infrastructure spend.


Revenue decreased

4%

due to a decline in transaction revenue, partially offset by an increase in non-transaction revenue. Transaction revenue decreased due to a decline in corporate bond ratings revenue driven by lower corporate bond issuance in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by an increase in structured finance revenue and bank loan ratings revenue. The increase in structured finance transaction revenue was driven by increased U.S. collateralized loan obligations ("CLO") issuance in the first half of the year. Non-transaction revenue grew due to an increase in surveillance revenue, higher entity credit ratings revenue, an increase in royalty revenue, and an increase in Ratings Evaluation Service activity. Transaction and non-transaction revenue benefited from improved contract terms across product categories.

Operating profit increased

1%

, with a 3 percentage point favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of higher legal settlement expenses in 2018 of 6 percentage points, partially offset by the favorable impact of higher employee severance charges in 2017 of 5 percentage points and higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2017 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 1%. This increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and a decrease in compensation costs related to lower incentive costs as well as the decreased headcount from attrition and prior year restructuring actions, partially offset by the decrease in revenue discussed above and an increase in costs related to the development of a global center for technology talent in India.

Market Issuance Volumes

We monitor market issuance volumes regularly within Ratings. Market issuance volumes noted within the discussion that follows are based on where an issuer is located or where the assets associated with an issue are located. Structured Finance issuance includes amounts when a transaction closes, not when initially priced and excludes domestically-rated Chinese issuance. The following tables depict changes in issuance levels as compared to the prior year based on data from SDC Platinum for Corporate bond issuance and based on a composite of external data feeds and Ratings' internal estimates for Structured Finance issuance.

*

Includes Industrials and Financial Services.

•

Corporate issuance was up in 2019 driven by double-digit increases in both high-yield and investment grade issuance. U.S. high-yield issuance increased as accommodating views from the U.S. Federal Reserve regarding interest rates throughout 2019 moved investors toward more fixed-rate debt. Strength was also seen in U.S. investment grade issuance as issuers were taking advantage of historically low borrowing costs. Increased issuance in Europe was driven by strength in high-yield issuance. Both high-yield and investment grade issuance comparisons also benefited from weakness in 2018 due to market volatility and slowing global economic growth.

and


.

•

ABS issuance was down slightly in the U.S. reflecting a decline in student loan and credit card transactions and down in Europe primarily in auto transactions reflecting uncertainty caused by regulation introducing a new framework for simple, transparent and standardized ("STS") securitizations effective January 1, 2019.

•

Issuance was down in the U.S and European structured credit markets driven by a decline in CLO transactions.

•

CMBS issuance was up in the U.S. reflecting increased market volume caused by a decline in interest rates. CMBS issuance was also up in Europe driven by increased market volume.

•

RMBS issuance was up in the U.S. reflecting increased market volume primarily driven by nonqualified mortgages. RMBS issuance was also up in Europe reflecting increased market volume in the fourth quarter of 2019.

•

Covered bond (debt securities backed by mortgages or other high-quality assets that remain on the issuer's balance sheet) issuance in Europe was down driven by difficult market conditions in the third and fourth quarters of 2019.

Industry Highlights and Outlook

Revenue increased in


due to an increase in corporate bond ratings revenue primarily driven by higher corporate bond issuance in the U.S. and Europe. In 2019, Ratings continued to focus on international expansion particularly in China and published its first ratings in the domestic Chinese bond market. Additionally, Ratings launched ESG Evaluation in 2019. The ESG Evaluation is a cross-sector, relative analysis of an entity's ability to operate successfully in the future and optimize long-term stakeholder value in light of its natural and social environment and the quality of its governance.

In 2020, Ratings will continue to focus on strengthening analytical excellence to drive market relevance, leveraging new technology and data capabilities to transform its value chain, entering new high-potential geographies with innovative products and extending its strong analytical capabilities to new opportunities such as ESG and cybersecurity.

Legal and Regulatory Environment

General

Ratings and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the U.S. and in other countries, and therefore existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the Company’s operations and the markets in which it operates. Additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered. In addition, in certain countries, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies. For example, governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers. We have reviewed the new laws, regulations and rules which have been adopted and we have implemented, or are planning to implement, changes as required. We do not believe that such new laws, regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, remuneration and rotation of credit rating agencies, and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies. The impact on us of the adoption of any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain, but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to Ratings’ rating activities, or adversely affect our ability to compete and/or our remuneration, or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings.

In the normal course of business both in the U.S. and abroad, Ratings (or the legal entities comprising Ratings) are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries. Many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of Ratings and are or have been brought by purchasers of rated securities. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct



investigations into Ratings’ compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.

U.S.

The businesses conducted by our Ratings segment are, in certain cases, regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the “Reform Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd Frank Act”), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business. The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the U.S.

S&P Global Ratings is a credit rating agency that is registered with the SEC as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). The SEC first began informally designating NRSROs in 1975 for use of their credit ratings in the determination of capital charges for registered brokers and dealers under the SEC’s Net Capital Rule. The Reform Act created a new SEC registration system for rating agencies that choose to register as NRSROs. Under the Reform Act, the SEC is given authority and oversight of NRSROs and can censure NRSROs, revoke their registration or limit or suspend their registration in certain cases. The rules implemented by the SEC pursuant to the Reform Act, the Dodd Frank Act and the Exchange Act address, among other things, prevention or misuse of material non-public information, conflicts of interest, documentation and assessment of internal controls, and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies. The public portions of the current version of S&P Global Ratings’ Form NRSRO are available on S&P Global Ratings’ website.

European Union

In the European Union ("EU"), the credit rating industry is registered and supervised through a pan-European regulatory framework which is a compilation of three sets of legislative actions. In 2009, the European Parliament passed a regulation (“CRA1”) that established an oversight regime for the credit rating industry in the EU, which became effective in 2010. CRA1 requires the registration, formal regulation and periodic inspection of credit rating agencies operating in the EU. Ratings was granted registration in October of 2011. In January of 2011, the EU established the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”), which, among other things, has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered credit rating industry throughout the EU.

Additional rules augmenting the supervisory framework for credit rating agencies went into effect in 2013. Commonly referred to as CRA3, these rules, among other things:

•

impose various additional procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers;

•

require member states to adopt laws imposing liability on credit rating agencies for an intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by the applicable regulations;

•

impose mandatory rotation requirements on credit rating agencies hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations, which may limit the number of years a credit rating agency can issue ratings for such securities of a particular issuer;

•

impose restrictions on credit rating agencies or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed; and

•

impose additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services.

The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the EU.

Other Jurisdictions

Outside of the U.S. and the EU, regulators and government officials have also been implementing formal oversight of credit rating agencies. Ratings is subject to regulations in most of the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and continues to work closely with regulators globally to promote the global consistency of regulatory requirements. Regulators in additional countries may introduce new regulations in the future. This includes the UK, in which the Financial Conduct Authority is  establishing its own credit rating agencies oversight regime for its exit from the EU.

Revenue increased

7%

and was favorably impacted by less than 1 percentage point from the net impact of recent acquisitions and a disposition. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions and disposition, increased revenue was driven by growth in annualized contract values in the Market Intelligence Desktop products, RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect®, CUSIP and our data feed products within Data Management Solutions. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions and disposition favorably impacting Desktop revenue growth by 1 percentage point, revenue growth at Data Management Solutions, Credit Risk Solutions and Desktop was 11%, 9% and 4%, respectively. Both domestic and international revenue increased compared to 2018. In 2019, international revenue represented 38% of Market Intelligence's total revenue compared to 36% in 2018. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than one percentage point. Revenue was favorably impacted by the acquisitions of 451 Research, LLC, Panjiva Inc. ("Panjiva") and the Rate Watch business ("RateWatch") in December of 2019, February of 2018 and June of 2018, respectively, and the transfer of Kensho revenue from Corporate in January of 2019, and unfavorably impacted by the disposition of SPIAS in July of 2019.

Excluding the favorable impact of the gain on the disposition of SPIAS of 5 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of acquisition-related costs in 2019 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 7%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher technology costs, higher compensation costs primarily driven by additional headcount and an increase in intersegment royalties tied to annualized contract value growth.


Revenue increased

9%

and was favorably impacted by 1 percentage point from the impact of recent acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the revenue increase was driven by growth in annualized contract values in the Market Intelligence Desktop, RatingsXpress® and RatingsDirect® products. Increases in annualized contract value for certain of our data feed products within Data Management Solutions also contributed to revenue growth. Both domestic and international revenue increased compared to 2017. In 2018, international revenue represented 36% of Market Intelligence's total revenue compared to 34% in 2017.

Operating profit increased

19%

, with a 3 percentage point favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.

The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by an increase in intersegment royalties tied to annualized contract value growth and increased data costs, and higher compensation costs driven by additional headcount partially related to the acquisitions of Panjiva in February of 2018 and Rate Watch in June of 2018.

Industry Highlights and Outlook

In 2019, Market Intelligence launched unique technology innovations including Textual Data Analytics, Kensho's Scribe and several ESG-related offerings. Textual Data Analytics, launched on Xpressfeed

TM

, provides sentiment scores and behavioral metrics derived from earnings call transcripts. Kensho's Scribe is a speech recognition solution specifically optimized for financial audio.

In 2020, Market Intelligence will continue to focus on leveraging its strong content heritage to expand the core business, streamlining and enriching the customer experience across all delivery platforms, and harnessing new data sources and technology to extend into new geographies and growth areas such as ESG.

Legal and Regulatory Environment

The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the U.S. and abroad. Market Intelligence operates investment advisory businesses that are regulated in the U.S. under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Investment Advisers Act”) and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.

Market Intelligence operates a business that is authorized and regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”). As such, this business is authorized to arrange and advise on investments, and is also entitled to exercise a passport right to provide specified cross border services into other European Economic Area (“EEA”) States, and is to the conditions under the E.U. Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”).



The markets for research and investment advisory services are very competitive. Market Intelligence competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its research and advisory services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and services, and technological innovation. For a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Market Intelligence business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

European Union

The EU enacted a package of legislative measures known as MiFID II ("MiFID II"), which revises and updates the existing EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive framework, and the substantive provisions became applicable in all EU Member States as of January 3, 2018. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things: (i) impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation; (iv) require the unbundling of investment research and direct  how asset managers pay for research either out of a research payment account or from a firm’s profits; and (v) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the EU Market Infrastructure Regulation of 2011). Although the MiFID II package is “framework” legislation (meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures, including some technical standards yet to be adopted by the European Commission), the introduction of the MiFID II package may result in changes to the manner in which Market Intelligence licenses its price certain products. MiFID II may impose regulatory burdens on Market Intelligence activities in the EU, although the exact impact and costs are not yet known.

Platts

Platts is the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets. Platts provides essential price data, analytics, and industry insight enabling the commodity and energy markets to perform with greater transparency and efficiency.

On July 31, 2019, we completed the sale of RigData, a business within our Platts segment, to Drilling Info, Inc. RigData is a provider of daily information on rig activity for the natural gas and oil markets across North America. During 2019, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $27 million ($26 million after-tax) in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of RigData.

Platts' revenue is generated primarily through the following sources:

•

Subscription revenue

—

primarily from subscriptions to our real-time news, market data and price assessments, along with other information products;

•

Sales usage-based royalties

—

primarily from licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges, and

•

Non-subscription revenue

—

conference sponsorship, consulting engagements, and events.





includes a gain on the disposition of RigData of $27 million and employee severance charges of $1 million.


includes a non-cash acquisition-related adjustment of $11 million, a charge to exit a leased facility of $6 million, an asset write-off of $2 million and employee severance charges of $2 million.


includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of

$12 million

and both

includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of

$18 million

.


Revenue increased

4%

and was unfavorably impacted by less than 1 percentage point from the net impact of recent acquisitions and a disposition. Excluding the acquisitions and disposition, revenue increased due to continued demand for market data and price assessment products driven by both expanded product offerings to our existing customers combined with enhanced contract terms. Additionally, revenue growth was driven by an increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges mainly due to increased trading volumes in Iron Ore, LNG and Gasoil. Demand for market data and price assessment products was driven by international customers. International revenue increased and domestic revenue, which was unfavorably impacted by the disposition of RigData in July of 2019, remained relatively unchanged compared to 2018. In 2019, international revenue represented 67% of Platts total revenue compared to 65% in 2018. Petroleum continues to be the most significant revenue driver, followed by power & gas, metals and petrochemicals also contributing to revenue growth. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point. Revenue was unfavorably impacted by the disposition of RigData in July of 2019 and favorably impacted by the acquisitions of Live Rice Index and Enerdata in August of 2019 and September of 2019, respectively. See Note 2 -

Acquisitions and Divestitures

to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

Operating profit increased

15%

with a 2 percentage point favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Excluding the favorable impact of the gain on the disposition of RigData of 7 percentage points and lower amortization of intangibles in 2019 of 2 percentage points, operating profit increased 6%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by an increase in operating costs to support revenue growth and business initiatives at Platts, including Asia expansion initiatives, an increase in compensation costs due to annual merit increases and increased headcount, higher technology costs, an increase in the bad debt provision in the current year and one-time costs related to the discontinuation of a product line at Platts.


Revenue increased

5%

due to continued demand for market data and price assessment products across all commodity sectors, led by petroleum, partially offset by a decrease in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges mainly due to a decline in oil trading volumes in the first nine months of 2018.



Demand for market data and price assessment products was driven by international customers. While petroleum is still the biggest revenue driver, the proportional revenue mix continues to become more diversified as other sectors contributed to revenue growth including petrochemicals, metals and agriculture. International revenue increased and domestic revenue remained relatively unchanged compared to 2017. In 2018, international revenue represented 65% of Platts total revenue compared to 63% in 2017.

Operating profit increased

18%

. Excluding the favorable impact of a non-cash acquisition-related adjustment in 2017 of 4 percentage points, a charge to exit a leased facility in 2017 of 2 percentage points, an asset write-off in 2017 of 1 percentage point and employee severance charges in 2017 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 10%, with the increase largely driven by revenue growth.

Industry Highlights and Outlook

In 2019, sustained demand for market data and price assessment products, led by petroleum, continued to drive revenue growth. Revenue also increased from the licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges driven by higher trading volumes. In 2019, Platts continued to drive commercial transformation by enhancing and simplifying the customer experience. Additionally, Platts focused on expanding its capabilities in Asia. In 2020, Platts will continue to focus on extending the core business through innovation, simplifying its product and platform strategy, and driving commercial transformation.

Legal and Regulatory Environment

Platts’ commodities price assessment and information business is subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and abroad.  As discussed below under the heading “Indices-Legal and Regulatory Environment”, the financial benchmarks industry is subject to the new benchmark regulation in the EU (the “EU Benchmark Regulation”) as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions.  Platts has obtained authorization and is now supervised by the

Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets

in the Netherlands under the EU Benchmark Regulation, and may need to take similar steps in other jurisdictions including the United Kingdom post-Brexit and jurisdictions outside of Europe if they pass similar legislation.  For a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Platts business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

European Union

The EU has enacted MiFID II, which revise and update the existing EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and the substantive provisions became applicable in all EU Member States as of January 3, 2018. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things: (i) impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation; (iv) require the unbundling of investment research and direct  how asset managers pay for research either out of a research payment account or from a firm’s profits; and (v) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the E.U. Market Infrastructure Regulation of 2011). Although the MiFID II package is “framework” legislation (meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures, including some technical standards yet to be adopted by the European Commission), the introduction of the MiFID II package may result in changes to the manner in which Platts licenses its price assessments. MiFID II and the Market Abuse Regulation ("MAR") may impose additional regulatory burdens on Platts activities in the EU, although the exact impact and costs are not yet known.

In October of 2012, IOSCO issued its Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies ("PRA Principles"), which are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members. Platts has aligned its operations with the PRA Principles and, as recommended by IOSCO in its final report on the PRA Principles, has aligned to the PRA Principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks.

Indices

Indices is a global index provider maintaining a wide variety of indices to meet an array of investor needs. Indices’ mission is to provide transparent benchmarks to help with decision making, collaborate with the financial community to create innovative products, and provide investors with tools to monitor world markets.

Indices primarily derives revenue from asset-linked fees based on the S&P and Dow Jones indices and to a lesser extent generates subscription revenue and sales-usage based royalties. Specifically, Indices generates revenue from the following sources:

•

Investment vehicles

—

asset-linked fees such as ETFs and mutual funds, that are based on the S&P Dow Jones Indices' benchmarks and generate revenue through fees based on assets and underlying funds;



•

Exchange traded derivatives

—

generate sales usage-based royalties based on trading volumes of derivatives contracts listed on various exchanges;

•

Index-related licensing fees

—

fixed or variable annual and per-issue asset-linked fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products; and

•

Data and customized index subscription fees

—

fees from supporting index fund management, portfolio analytics and research.

The following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31:

and


includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of

.


Revenue increased

10%

due to higher levels of assets under management ("AUM") for ETFs and mutual funds. Additionally, revenue was favorably impacted by the buyout of the balance of intellectual property rights in a family of indices from one of our co-marketing and index development partners in the fourth quarter of 2018, retrospective fees for previously unlicensed and unreported index usage and benefits related to contract renegotiations. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in exchange-traded derivatives revenue primarily driven by lower volumes in 2019. Ending AUM for ETFs increased 30% to $1.701 trillion in 2019 and average AUM for ETFs increased 8% to $1.508 trillion compared to 2018. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

Operating profit grew

12%

. The impact of revenue growth was partially offset by higher operating costs from increased royalties due to increased traction of royalty-based products, higher legal expenses and increased compensation costs primarily driven by additional headcount, partially offset by lower incentive costs. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.




Revenue increased

15%

, primarily driven by higher AUM for ETFs and mutual funds, and higher exchange-traded derivative volumes due to market volatility. Average AUM for ETFs increased 20% to $1.399 trillion compared to 2017. Ending AUM for ETFs decreased 3% to $1.309 trillion compared to 2017 driven by the impact of market depreciation in the fourth quarter of 2018.   Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

Operating profit grew

18%

. The impact of revenue growth was partially offset by higher operating costs to support revenue growth and business initiatives at Indices and higher compensation costs from additional headcount. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

Industry Highlights and Outlook

Indices continues to be the leading index provider for the ETF market space. In 2019, higher average levels of AUM for ETFs contributed to revenue growth. In 2019, Indices continued to launch innovative indices, expand index product offerings and grow international partnerships. In 2020, Indices will continue to focus on growing the core business, expanding innovative offerings with focus on differentiated solutions such as factor, multi-asset-class, and ESG indices, and growing globally through collaborative client relationships.

Legal and Regulatory Environment

Over the past four years the financial benchmarks industry has been subject to specific benchmark regulation in the European Union (the "EU Benchmark Regulation") and Australia (the "Australia Benchmark Regulation"). Other jurisdictions are also considering new regulation for financial benchmarks.

The EU Benchmark Regulation was published June 30, 2016 and included provisions applicable to Indices and Platts, which became effective January 1, 2018.  Both Indices and Platts have established separate benchmark administrators in connection with their benchmark activities in Europe. The Indices and Platts entities are both based in Amsterdam and are authorized by the Netherlands Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). This legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time, although the exact impact remains unclear.

The Australian Benchmark Regulation was enacted in June of 2018 and included provisions applicable to Indices, designating the S&P ASX 200 a significant financial benchmark and therefore requiring Indices to obtain a license from the Australian Investment and Securities Commission (“ASIC”) as its administrator. Indices is in the process of obtaining such license. Although narrower in scope, the requirements of the Australian Benchmark Regulation are similar to those of the EU Benchmark Regulation. This legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time, although the exact impact remains unclear.

In July of 2013, the IOSCO issued Financial Benchmark Principles (IOSCO Principles), intended to promote the reliability of financial benchmark determinations. The IOSCO Principles address governance, benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices published by Indices. Even though the IOSCO Principles are not binding law, Indices has taken steps to align its governance regime and operations with the IOSCO Principles and engaged an independent auditor to perform an annual reasonable assurance review of such alignment.

The markets for index providers are very competitive. Indices competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its benchmark indices, client service, reputation, price, range of products and services (including geographic coverage) and technological innovation.  Our Indices business is impacted by market volatility, asset levels of investment products tracking indices, and trading volumes of certain exchange traded derivatives. Volatile capital markets, as well as changing investment styles, among other factors, may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an index-linked investment product.  For a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Indices business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We continue to maintain a strong financial position. Our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses and our core businesses have been strong cash generators. In


, cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future. We use our cash for a variety of needs, including but not limited to: ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, repayment of debt, capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure.



Cash Flow Overview

Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were

$2.9 billion

as of December 31,


, an increase of

$0.9 billion

as compared to December 31,

In


, free cash flow increased to

$2.5 billion

compared to

$1.8 billion

in


. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information” below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items.

Operating activities

Cash provided by operating activities

increased

to

$2.8 billion

in


as compared to

$2.1 billion

in


. The increase is mainly due to higher results from operations, lower incentive compensation payments and lower legal settlement payments in 2019.

Cash provided by operating activities

increased

to

$2.1 billion

in


as compared to

$2.0 billion

in


. The increase is mainly due to higher results from operations in 2018 and lower estimated income tax payments in 2018 due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate as a result of the enactment of the TCJA, partially offset by legal settlement payments and settlement payments following the resolution of tax audits.

Investing activities

Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions.

Cash used for investing activities decreased to

$0.1 billion

for


as compared to

$0.5 billion

to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

Financing activities

Our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, while cash inflows are primarily inflows from long-term and short-term debt borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

Cash used for financing activities decreased to

$1.8 billion

in


from

$2.3 billion

in


. The decrease is primarily attributable to higher cash paid for share repurchases in 2018 and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in 2019.

Cash used for financing activities increased to

$2.3 billion

from

$1.5 billion

in


. The increase is primarily attributable to higher cash paid for share repurchases in 2018.

During 2019, we received 5.9 million shares, including 0.4 million shares received in January of 2019 related to our October 29, 2018 accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement, resulting in $1,240 million of cash used to repurchase shares. We entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution on August 5, 2019 to initiate share repurchases aggregating $500 million. We repurchased a total of 2.0 million shares under the ASR agreement for an average purchase price of $253.36 per share. We entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution on February 11, 2019 to initiate share repurchases aggregating $500 million. We repurchased a total of 2.3 million shares under the ASR agreement for an average purchase price of $214.65 per share.



During 2018, we used cash to repurchase 8.4 million shares for $1.7 billion. We entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution on October 29, 2018 to initiate share repurchases aggregating $500 million. We repurchased a total of 2.9 million shares under the ASR agreement for an average purchase price of $173.80 per share. We entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution on March 6, 2018 to initiate share repurchases aggregating $1 billion. We repurchased a total of 5.1 million shares under that ASR agreement for an average purchase price of $197.49 per share.

During 2017, we used cash to repurchase 6.8 million shares for $1.0 billion. We entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution on August 1, 2017 to initiate share repurchases aggregating $500 million. We repurchased a total of 3.2 million shares under the ASR agreement for an average purchase price of $154.46 per share.

On December 4, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 50 million shares, which was approximately 18% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. Our current repurchase program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions. As of

December 31, 2019

,

4.7 million

shares remained available under our current repurchase program.

See Note 9

— Equity

to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion related to our ASR agreements.

Additional Financing

We have the ability to borrow a total of

$1.2 billion

through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our revolving $1.2 billion five-year credit agreement (our "credit facility") that we entered into on June 30, 2017. This credit facility will terminate on June 30, 2022. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of

December 31, 2019

and


.

Depending on our corporate credit rating, we pay a commitment fee of


to

17.5

basis points for our credit facility, whether or not amounts have been borrowed. We currently pay a commitment fee of


basis points. The interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is, at our option, calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing London Inter-Bank Offer Rate, the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the Federal Funds Rate. For certain borrowings under this credit facility, there is also a spread based on our corporate credit rating.

Our credit facility contains certain covenants. The only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, is not greater than


to


, and this covenant level has never been exceeded.

On November 1, 2019, Fitch Ratings upgraded our short-term/commercial paper rating to F1 from F2, affirmed our long-term debt rating and the ratings outlook was maintained at stable.

Dividends

On January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from

$0.57

per share to $0.67 per share.

Contractual Obligations

We typically have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, while other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized, but are disclosed herein. For example, we are contractually committed to contracts for information-technology outsourcing, certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance.

We believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital and debt service for

Other consists primarily of commitments for unconditional purchase obligations in contracts for information-technology outsourcing and certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance.

As of

December 31, 2019

, we had

$124 million

of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. We have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because, until formal resolutions are reached, reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable.

As of

December 31, 2019

, we have recorded

$2,268 million

for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC partnership discussed in Note 9 –

Equity

to our consolidated financial statements.  Specifically, this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, whereby, after December 31, 2017, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC ("CGIS") has the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least 20% of their share in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. We have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make.

We make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans. During


, we contributed

$46 million

to our retirement plans. Expected employer contributions in


are

$11 million

and

$5 million

for our retirement and postretirement plans, respectively. In


, we may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status. See Note 7 –

Employee Benefits

to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as specific purpose or variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such we are not exposed to any financial liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.



RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to free cash flow. Additionally, we have considered certain items in evaluating free cash flow, which are included in the table below.

We believe the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. We use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and repurchase stock.

The presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow excluding the impact of the items below:


Distributions to noncontrolling interest holders is net of amounts owed to the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture by the noncontrolling interest holders.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests. We base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.



Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this MD&A.

We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

Revenue recognition

We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" using the modified retrospective transition method applied to our revenue contracts with customers as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior year amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC 605 "Revenue Recognition". We recorded a net increase to opening retained earnings of

$35 million

as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative effect of adopting ASC 606, with the impact primarily related to our treatment of costs to obtain a contract and to a lesser extent, changes to the timing of the recognition of our subscription and non-transaction revenues. We recognized incremental revenue of $6 million for the year ended

December 31, 2018

as a result of the adoption of this standard.

Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Under ASC 605, revenue was recognized as it was earned and when services were rendered. See Note 1 -

Accounting Policies

to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions. In determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators. The impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately $16 million.

For the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, there were no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in


.

Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets)

We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or management’s estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was

$4.4 billion

. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.



Goodwill

As part of our annual impairment test of our four reporting units, we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Reporting units are generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.  Our qualitative assessment included, but was not limited to, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key Company personnel and our share price. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. For


, based on our qualitative assessments, we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair values were greater than their respective carrying amounts.

If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge.

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

We evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If necessary, the impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. If the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach. The fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations.

We performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended

December 31, 2019

Retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits

Our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances, including compensation increases, long-term return on pension plan assets, healthcare cost trends, discount rates and other factors. In determining such assumptions, we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from our assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants. While we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits.

The following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits:

•

Discount rate assumptions are based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds.

•

Healthcare cost trend assumptions are based on historical market data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends.

•

The expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan’s asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the long-term.



Our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our U.S. retirement plans are as follows:

Stock-based compensation

Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is classified as both operating-related expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income.

We use a lattice-based option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted:

Because lattice-based option-pricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions, those ranges are disclosed. These assumptions are based on multiple factors, including historical exercise patterns, post-vesting termination rates, expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price. The risk-free interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield at the date of grant. We use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.

In 2018, we made a one-time issuance of incentive stock options under the 2002 Plan to replace Kensho employees' stock options that were assumed in connection with our acquisition of Kensho in April of 2018. There were no stock options granted in 2019 and 2017.

Income taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.

Judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states, and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2020. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits.

As of December 31, 2019, we have approximately $3.2 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which $776 million is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations.



Contingencies

We are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We recognize a liability for such contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter. When we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record its best estimate within the range. We disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

The fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach. Our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.

RECENT

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See Note 1 –

Accounting Policies

to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards. We expect the adoption of these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet; however, we do not expect that these standards will have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or cash flows.

Item 7A

. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates. We have operations in various foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. During the years ended

December 31, 2019

and 2018, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. These forward contracts are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. During the years ended

December 31, 2019

, 2018 and 2017, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap contract to hedge a portion of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary against volatility in foreign exchange rates. We have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. See Note 6 –

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of S&P Global Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited S&P Global Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, S&P Global Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of S&P Global Inc. as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated February 10, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Accounting Policies

Nature of operations

S&P Global Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading  provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide.  The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, trading firms and issuers; and the commodity markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, petrochemicals and agriculture.

Our operations consist of

four

reportable segments: S&P Global Ratings ("Ratings"), S&P Global Market Intelligence ("Market Intelligence"), S&P Global Platts ("Platts") and S&P Dow Jones Indices ("Indices").

•

Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks.

•

Market Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data, research and analytical capabilities, which integrate cross-asset analytics and desktop services.

•

Platts is the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets.

•

Indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors.

In April of 2018, we acquired Kensho Technologies Inc. ("Kensho") for approximately

$


million

, net of cash acquired, in a mix of cash and stock. Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the contract obligations for revenue from Kensho's major customers were transferred to Market Intelligence for fulfillment.  As a result of this transfer, from January 1, 2019, revenue from contracts with Kensho’s customers is reflected in Market Intelligence’s results.  In 2018, the revenue from contracts with Kensho’s customers was reported in Corporate revenue. Restricted cash of

$


million

and

$


million

included in our consolidated balance sheets as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, includes amounts held in escrow accounts in connection with our acquisition of Kensho. See Note 2

Acquisitions and Divestitures

for additional information and  Note 12 –

Segment and Geographic Information

for further discussion on our reportable segments.

Adoption of ASC 842, “Leases”

On January 1, 2019, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ("FASB ASC") 842 that requires a lessee to recognize "right of use" assets with offsetting lease liabilities on the balance sheet, with expenses recognized similar to previously issued guidance. We adopted the new lease standard effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this transition method, the standard was adopted prospectively without restating prior period's financial statements. See Note 13

—

Commitments and Contingencies

for further details on our leases.

Adoption of ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”

We adopted FASB ASC 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" using the modified retrospective transition method applied to our revenue contracts with customers as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior year amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC 605 "Revenue Recognition". We recorded a net increase to opening retained earnings of

$


million

as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative effect of adopting ASC 606, with the impact primarily related to our treatment of costs to obtain a contract and to a lesser extent, changes to the timing of the recognition of our subscription and non-transaction revenues.

Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Under ASC 605, revenue was recognized as it was earned and when services were rendered.

Subscription revenue

Subscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily derived from distribution of data, analytics, third party research, and credit ratings-related information primarily through web-based channels including Market Intelligence Desktop, RatingsDirect®, RatingsXpress®, and Credit Analytics. Subscription revenue at Platts is generated by providing customers access to commodity and energy-related price assessments, market data, and real-time news, along with other information services. Subscription revenue at Indices is derived from the contracts for underlying data of our indexes to support our customers' management of index funds, portfolio analytics, and research.



For subscription products and services, we generally provide continuous access to dynamic data sets and analytics for a defined period, with revenue recognized ratably as our performance obligation to provide access to our data and analytics is progressively                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      fulfilled over the stated term of the contract.

Non-transaction revenue

Non-transaction revenue at Ratings is primarily related to surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment revenue elimination of

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

for the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


, and


respectively, mainly consisting of the royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings.

For non-transaction revenue related to Rating’s surveillance services, we continuously monitor factors that impact the creditworthiness of an issuer over the contractual term with revenue recognized to the extent that our performance obligation is progressively fulfilled over the term contract. Because surveillance services are continuously provided throughout the term of the contract, our measure of progress towards fulfillment of our obligation to monitor a rating is a time-based output measure with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract.

Non-subscription / Transaction revenue

Transaction revenue at our Ratings segment primarily includes fees associated with:

•

ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments; as well as structured finance instruments;

•

bank loan ratings; and

•

corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of a company which does not currently have a Ratings credit rating.

Transaction revenue is recognized at the point in time when our performance obligation is satisfied by issuing a rating on our customer's instruments, our customer's creditworthiness, or a counter-party's creditworthiness and when we have a right to payment and the customer can benefit from the significant risks and rewards of ownership.

Non-subscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily related to certain advisory, pricing and analytical services. Non-subscription revenue at Platts is primarily related to conference sponsorship, consulting engagements and events.

Asset-linked fees

Asset-linked fees at Indices and Market Intelligence are primarily related to royalties payments based on the value of assets under management in our customers exchange-traded funds and mutual funds.

For asset-linked products and services, we provide licenses conveying continuous access to our index and benchmark-related intellectual property during a specified contract term. Revenue is recognized when the extent that our customers have used our licensed intellectual property can be quantified. Recognition of revenue for our asset-linked fee arrangements is subject to the "recognition constraint" for usage-based royalty payments because we cannot reasonably predict the value of the assets that will be invested in index funds structured using our intellectual property until it is either publicly available or when we are notified by our customers. Revenue derived from an asset-linked fee arrangement is measured and recognized when the certainty of the extent of its utilization of our index products by our customers is known.

Sales usage-based royalties

Sales usage-based royalty revenue at our Indices segment is primarily related to trading based fees from exchange-traded derivatives. Sales and usage-based royalty revenue at our Platts segment is primarily related to licensing of its proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges.

For sales usage-based royalty products and services, we provide licenses conveying the right to continuous access to our intellectual property over the contract term, with revenue recognized when the extent of our license’s utilization can be quantified, or more specifically, when trading volumes are known and publicly available to us or when we are notified by our customers. Recognition of revenue of fees tied to trading volumes is subject to the recognition constraint for a usage-based royalty promised by our customers in exchange for the license of our intellectual property, with revenue recognized when trading volumes are known.



Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations

Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. Revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one performance obligation is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned. The fair value of the service components are determined using an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately. If the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable, we make our best estimate of the services’ stand-alone selling price and record revenue as it is earned over the service period.

Receivables

We record a receivable when a customer is billed or when revenue is recognized prior to billing a customer. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual period.

Contract Assets

Contract assets include unbilled amounts from when the Company transfers service to a customer before a customer pays consideration or before payment is due. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, contract assets were

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets.

Unearned Revenue

We record unearned revenue when cash payments are received in advance of our performance. The increase in the unearned revenue balance for the year ended

December 31, 2019

is primarily driven by cash payments received in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, offset by

$

1.7

billion

of revenues recognized that were included in the unearned revenue balance at the beginning of the period.

Remaining Performance Obligations

Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of contracts for work that has not yet been performed. As of

December 31, 2019

, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was

$

1.9

billion

. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately half and three-quarters of the remaining performance obligations over the next


and


months, respectively, with the remainder recognized thereafter.

We do not disclose the value of unfulfilled performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts where revenue is a usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property.

Costs to Obtain a Contract

We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales commission programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were

$


million

and

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

, respectively, and are included in prepaid and other current assets and other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The asset will be amortized over a period consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, calculated based on the customer term and the average life of the products and services underlying the contracts. The expense is recorded within selling and general expenses.

We expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling and general expenses.

Other Expense (Income), net

The components of other expense (income), net for the year ended

December 31

are as follows:


During 2019, the Company purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company assumed a portion of the Company's obligation to pay pension benefits to the plan's beneficiaries. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded by pension plan assets. The net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and post retirement plans for 2019 includes a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge of

$


million

reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan.



Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations

Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale

We classify a disposal group to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group; the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal group; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated; the sale of the disposal group is probable, and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond our control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year; the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.

A disposal group that is classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until the date of sale.

The fair value of a disposal group less any costs to sell is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any subsequent changes are reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Upon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group as held for sale in the current period in our consolidated balance sheets.

Discontinued Operations

In determining whether a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be presented as a discontinued operation, we make a determination whether the disposal represents a strategic shift that had, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results. A component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished both operationally and for financial reporting purposes.  If we conclude that the disposal represents a strategic shift, then the results of operations of the group of assets being disposed of (as well as any gain or loss on the disposal transaction) are aggregated for separate presentation apart from our continuing operating results in the consolidated financial statements.

Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries and our share of earnings or losses of joint ventures and affiliated companies under the equity method of accounting. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include ordinary bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that consist primarily of money market funds with unrestricted daily liquidity and fixed term time deposits. Such investments and bank deposits are stated at cost, which approximates market value, and were

$

2.9

billion

and

$

1.9

billion

as of December 31,


and


, respectively. These investments are not subject to significant market risk.

Restricted cash

Cash that is subject to legal restrictions or is unavailable for general operating purposes is classified as restricted cash.

Short-term investments

Short-term investments are securities with original maturities greater than

90 days

that are available for use in our operations in the next twelve months. The short-term investments, primarily consisting of certificates of deposit and mutual funds, are classified as held-to-maturity and therefore are carried at cost. Interest and dividends are recorded in income when earned.

Accounts receivable

Credit is extended to customers based upon an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition. Accounts receivable, which include billings consistent with terms of contractual arrangements, are recorded at net realizable value.



Allowance for doubtful accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions. In determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators.

Capitalized technology costs

We capitalize certain software development and website implementation costs. Capitalized costs only include incremental, direct costs of materials and services incurred to develop the software after the preliminary project stage is completed, funding has been committed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Incremental costs are expenditures that are out-of-pocket to us and are not part of an allocation or existing expense base. Software development and website implementation costs are expensed as incurred during the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs are amortized from the year the software is ready for its intended use over its estimated useful life,

three

to

seven

years, using the straight-line method. Periodically, we evaluate the amortization methods, remaining lives and recoverability of such costs. Capitalized software development and website implementation costs are included in other non-current assets and are presented net of accumulated amortization.

Gross capitalized technology costs were

$


million

and

$


million

as of December 31,


and


, respectively. Accumulated amortization of capitalized technology costs was

$


million

and

$


million

as of December 31,


and


, respectively.

Fair Value

Certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value and classified within a fair value hierarchy based on inputs used when measuring fair value. We have forward exchange contracts and a cross currency swap that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis.

Other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity and highly liquid nature of these instruments.

The fair value of our long-term debt borrowings were

$

3.9

billion

and

$

3.8

billion

as of December 31,


and


, respectively, and was estimated based on quoted market prices.

Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets)

We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or management’s estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets.

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have

four

reporting units with goodwill that are evaluated for impairment.

We initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred or exist that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. If, based on our evaluation we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying amounts we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test.

When conducting the first step of our two step impairment test to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. Fair value of the reporting units are estimated using the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted free cash flow (“DCF”) analyses and are corroborated using the market approach, which incorporates the use of revenue and earnings multiples based on market data. The DCF analyses are based on the current operating budgets and estimated long-term growth projections for each reporting unit. Future cash flows are discounted based on a market comparable weighted average cost of capital rate for each reporting unit, adjusted for market and other risks where appropriate. In addition, we analyze any difference between the sum of the fair values of the reporting units and our total market capitalization for reasonableness, taking into account certain factors including control premiums.



If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill. The fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge.

We evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If necessary, the impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. If the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment analysis is performed  using the income approach. An impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations.

We performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended

December 31, 2019

Foreign currency translation

We have operations in many foreign countries. For most international operations, the local currency is the functional currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the United States ("U.S.") dollar is the functional currency. For local currency operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end of period exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. Foreign currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of equity.

Depreciation

The costs of property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based upon the following estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements from


to


years and equipment and furniture from


to


years

. The costs of leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives or the terms of the respective leases.

Advertising expense

The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred.

We incurred

$

Stock-based compensation

Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is classified as both operating-related expense and selling and general expense in the consolidated statements of income.

We use a lattice-based option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted:



Because lattice-based option-pricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions, those ranges are disclosed. These assumptions are based on multiple factors, including historical exercise patterns, post-vesting termination rates, expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price. The risk-free interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield at the date of grant. We use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.

In 2018, we made a one-time issuance of incentive stock options under the 2002 Plan to replace Kensho employees' stock options that were assumed in connection with our acquisition of Kensho in April of 2018. There were no stock options granted in 2019 and 2017.

Income taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.

Judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states, and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that examinations will be settled prior to December 31,


. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits.

As of

December 31, 2019

, we have approximately

$

3.2

billion

of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which

$


million

is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

The agreement with the minority partners of our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture contains redemption features whereby interests held by our minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Since redemption of the noncontrolling interest is outside of our control, this interest is presented on our consolidated balance sheets under the caption “Redeemable noncontrolling interest.” If the interest were to be redeemed, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on the date of redemption. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using both income and  market valuation approaches. Our income and market valuation approaches incorporate Level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income.

See Note 9 –

Equity

for further detail.

Contingencies

We accrue for loss contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter. When we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record our best estimate within the range. We disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred.



Recent Accounting Standards

In January 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a guidance intended to clarify the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under ASC 321, investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting under ASC 323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under ASC 815. This guidance could change how the Company accounts for an equity security under the measurement alternative. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020; however early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

In December of 2019, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance eliminates certain exceptions to the general principles of Topic 740. The guidance is effective for reporting periods after December 15, 2020; however, early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

In November of 2018, the FASB issued guidance that provides clarification on whether certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants should be accounted for as revenue under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; however early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August of 2018, the FASB issued guidance to align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; however early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August of 2017, the FASB issued guidance to enhance the hedge accounting model for both nonfinancial and financial risk components, which includes amendments to address certain aspects of recognition and presentation disclosure. The guidance was effective on January 1, 2019, and the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In January of 2017, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill and eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; however, early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June of 2016, the FASB issued guidance that amends the measurement of credit losses on certain financial instruments by requiring the use of an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We have completed our evaluation of changes to our accounting policies, business processes, systems and internal controls to support the recognition and disclosure requirements under the new standard. The adoption of the new standard will impact our process around the assessment of the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable and contract assets to incorporate the impact of forecasts of future economic conditions, in addition to past events and current economic conditions. Based on our preliminary analysis, we anticipate that following the adoption of the new standard, the Company will recognize an immaterial adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption.

In February of 2016, the FASB issued guidance amending the accounting for leases that requires a lessee to recognize "right of use" assets with offsetting lease liabilities on the balance sheet, with expenses recognized similar to previously issued guidance. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new lease standard effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. In July of 2018, the FASB issued a subsequent update providing entities an additional transition method to adopt the new lease standard, allowing entities to adopt the standard prospectively without restating prior period's financial statements. We have elected this transition method upon adoption on January 1, 2019.  We have also elected to apply the "package" of practical expedients permitting entities to forgo reassessment of (1) the lease classification of expired or existing leases, (2) whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases, and (3) the accounting for initial direct costs of existing leases. This standard had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet, but did not have an impact on our consolidated statements of income or cash flows. As part of our implementation process, we have refined our processes, procedures, and controls to capture the complete population of leases that incorporates a third party software solution to report the financial statement impact of the new standard.

Expected amortization expense for intangible assets over the next five years for the years ended December 31, assuming no further acquisitions or dispositions, is as follows:



4.

Taxes on Income

Income before taxes on income resulting from domestic and foreign operations is as follows:

The provision for taxes on income consists of the following:

A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate for financial reporting purposes is as follows:

The increase in the effective income tax rate in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in accruals for potential tax liabilities for prior years in various jurisdictions. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2018 was primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”). Additionally, a one-time transition tax charge of

$


million

due to the TCJA was recorded in 2017, which included tax expense of approximately

$


million

on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and a tax benefit of approximately

$


million

in respect of the re-valuation of the net U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the reduced corporate income tax rate.

We have elected to recognize the tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) as a period expense in the year the tax is incurred. GILTI expense is included in Other, net above.



The principal temporary differences between the accounting for income and expenses for financial reporting and income tax purposes are as follows:

We record valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that such deferred income tax assets will not be realized based upon all the available evidence. The valuation allowance is primarily related to operating losses.

As of December 31, 2019, we have approximately

$

3.2

billion

of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which

$


million

is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations. We have not recorded deferred income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable.

We made net income tax payments totaling

$


million

in


,

$


million

in


, and

$


million

in


. As of

December 31, 2019

, we had net operating loss carryforwards of

$


million

, of which a significant portion has an unlimited carryover period under current law.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:



The total amount of federal, state and local, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits as of

December 31, 2019

,


and


was

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the period ended December 31, 2019, the change in unrecognized tax benefits resulted in a net increase of tax expense of

$


million

.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating-related expense, respectively. Based on the current status of income tax audits, we believe that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the balance sheet may be reduced by up to approximately

$


million

in the next twelve months as a result of the resolution of local tax examinations. In addition to the unrecognized tax benefits, as of

December 31, 2019

and


, we had

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits.

The U.S. federal income tax audit for 2017 and 2018 is in process. During 2019, we completed state and foreign tax audits and, with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, state, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2013. The impact to tax expense in


,


and


was not material.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31,


. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period, we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits.

through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our revolving

$

1.2

billion

five-year credit agreement (our "credit facility") that we entered into on June 30, 2017. This credit facility will terminate on June 30, 2022. There were

no

commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of

December 31, 2019

Depending on our corporate credit rating, we pay a commitment fee of


to

17.5

basis points for our credit facility, whether or not amounts have been borrowed. We currently pay a commitment fee of


basis points. The interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is, at our option, calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing London Inter-Bank Offer Rate, the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the Federal Funds Rate. For certain borrowings under this credit facility, there is also a spread based on our corporate credit rating.

Our credit facility contains certain covenants. The only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, is not greater than

Derivative Instruments

Our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates. We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate or hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2019, we have entered into a cross currency swap contract to hedge a portion of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary against volatility in foreign exchange rates.

These contracts are recorded at fair value that is based on foreign currency exchange rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivative contracts within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Undesignated Derivative Instruments

During the twelve months ended

December 31, 2019

, 2018 and 2017 we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. These forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of

December 31, 2019

and 2018, the aggregate notional value of these outstanding forward contracts was

$


million and

$


million, respectively. The changes in fair value of these forward contracts are recorded in prepaid and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet with their corresponding change in fair value recognized into selling and general expenses in the consolidated statement of income. The amount recorded in selling and general expense for the twelve months ended

December 31, 2019

and 2018 related to these contracts was a net gain of

$


million

and a net loss of

$


million

, respectively.

Net Investment Hedge

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we entered into a cross currency swap to hedge a portion of our net investment in a certain European subsidiary against volatility in the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. This swap is designated and qualifies as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary and is scheduled to mature in 2024.  As of December 31, 2019, the notional value of our outstanding cross currency swap designated as a net investment hedge was

$


million. The changes in the fair value of this swap are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of other comprehensive income (loss), and reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. We have elected to assess the effectiveness of our net investment hedge based on changes in spot exchange rates. Accordingly, amounts related to the cross currency swap recognized directly in net income during 2019 represent net periodic interest settlements and accruals, which are recognized in interest expense, net. We recognized net interest income of

$


million

in 2019.



Cash Flow Hedges

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of the Indian rupee, British pound, and Euro exposures through the fourth quarter of 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These contracts are intended to offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future revenue and operating costs and are scheduled to mature within twelve months. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and are subsequently reclassified into revenue and selling and general expenses in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings.

As of

December 31, 2019

, we estimate that

$


million

of the net gains related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.

As of

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

, the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was

$


million and

Employee Benefits

We maintain a number of active defined contribution retirement plans for our employees. The majority of our defined benefit plans are frozen. As a result, no new employees will be permitted to enter these plans and no additional benefits for current participants in the frozen plans will be accrued.

We also have supplemental benefit plans that provide senior management with supplemental retirement, disability and death benefits. Certain supplemental retirement benefits are based on final monthly earnings. In addition, we sponsor a voluntary 401(k) plan under which we may match employee contributions up to certain levels of compensation as well as profit-sharing plans under which we contribute a percentage of eligible employees' compensation to the employees' accounts.

We also provide certain medical, dental and life insurance benefits for active and retired employees and eligible dependents. The medical and dental plans and supplemental life insurance plan are contributory, while the basic life insurance plan is noncontributory. We currently do not prefund any of these plans.

We recognize the funded status of our retirement and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes. The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss represent net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to our accounting policy for amortizing such amounts.

Net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and postretirement plans other than the service cost component are included in other expense (income), net in our consolidated statements of income.



Benefit Obligation

A summary of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, as well as the funded status for the retirement and postretirement plans as of

December 31,

2019 and 2018, is as follows (benefits paid in the table below include only those amounts contributed directly to or paid directly from plan assets):


Relates to the impact of a retiree annuity purchase in 2019. The Company purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company assumed a portion of the Company's obligation to pay pension benefits to the plan's beneficiaries. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded by pension plan assets.

The actuarial loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss for our retirement plans and expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost during the year ending December 31,


is

Assumptions


The assumed weighted-average healthcare cost trend rate will decrease ratably from


%

in


to


%

in 2024 and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed healthcare cost trends have an effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans. A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend creates the following effects:


Effective January 1, 2019, we changed our discount rate assumption on our U.S. retirement plans to

4.40

%

from

3.68

%

in 2018 and changed our discount rate assumption on our U.K. plan to

2.72

%

from

2.41

%

in 2018.


The expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan’s asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the long-term. Effective January 1, 2020, our return on assets assumption for the U.S. plan was reduced to

5.50

%

from

6.00

%

and the U.K. plan remained unchanged at

6.00

%

.

Cash Flows

In December of 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) was enacted. The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, known as “Medicare Part D”, and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Our benefits provided to certain participants are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D, and, accordingly, we are entitled to a subsidy.

Expected employer contributions in


are

$


million

and

$


million

for our retirement and postretirement plans, respectively. In


, we may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status.

Information about the expected cash flows for our retirement and postretirement plans and the impact of the Medicare subsidy is as follows:


Reflects the total benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants’ share of the cost.


Reflects the total benefits expected to be paid from our assets.


Expected medicare subsidy amounts, for the years presented, are less than

$


million

.



Fair Value of Plan Assets

In accordance with authoritative guidance for fair value measurements certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

•

Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

•

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The fair value of our defined benefit plans assets as of

December 31, 2019

and


, by asset class is as follows:




Includes securities that are tracked in the S&P Smallcap 600 index.


Includes securities that are mainly investment grade obligations of issuers in the U.S.


Includes U.S. mortgage-backed securities that are not backed by the U.S. government.


Includes a fund which holds real estate properties in the U.K.


Includes the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Index, the Standard & Poor's MidCap 400 Composite Stock Index, a short-term investment fund which is a common collective trust vehicle, and other various asset classes.

For securities that are quoted in active markets, the trustee/custodian determines fair value by applying securities’ prices obtained from its pricing vendors. For commingled funds that are not actively traded, the trustee applies pricing information provided by investment management firms to the unit quantities of such funds. Investment management firms employ their own pricing vendors to value the securities underlying each commingled fund. Underlying securities that are not actively traded derive their prices from investment managers, which in turn, employ vendors that use pricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow, comparables). The domestic defined benefit plans have no investment in our stock, except through the S&P 500 commingled trust index fund.

The trustee obtains estimated prices from vendors for securities that are not easily quotable and they are categorized accordingly as Level 3.

The following table details further information on our plan assets where we have used significant unobservable inputs :

The pension assets are invested with the goal of producing a combination of capital growth, income and a liability hedge. The mix of assets is established after consideration of the long-term performance and risk characteristics of asset classes. Investments are selected based on their potential to enhance returns, preserve capital and reduce overall volatility. Holdings are diversified within each asset class. The portfolios employ a mix of index and actively managed equity strategies by market capitalization, style, geographic regions and economic sectors. The fixed income strategies include U.S. long duration securities, opportunistic fixed income securities and U.K. debt instruments. The short-term portfolio, whose primary goal is capital preservation for liquidity purposes, is composed of government and government-agency securities, uninvested cash, receivables and payables. The portfolios do not employ any financial leverage.

U.S. Defined Contribution Plan

Assets of the defined contribution plan in the U.S. consist primarily of investment options, which include actively managed equity, indexed equity, actively managed equity/bond funds, target date funds, S&P Global Inc. common stock, stable value and money market strategies. There is also a self-directed mutual fund investment option. The plan purchased

Stock-Based Compensation

We issue stock-based incentive awards to our eligible employees under the 2019 Employee Stock Incentive Plan and to our eligible non-employee Directors under a Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan. No further awards may be granted under the 2002 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2002 Plan”), although awards granted under the 2002 Plan prior to the adoption of the new 2019 Plan in June of 2019 remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. The remaining outstanding options under the 2002 Plan will have fully met their maximum term and expire in the second quarter of 2028.

•

2019 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”)

– The 2019 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance stock, restricted stock and other stock-based awards.

•

Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan

– Under this plan, common stock reserved may be credited to deferred stock accounts for eligible Directors. In general, the plan requires that


%

of eligible Directors’ annual compensation plus dividend equivalents be credited to deferred stock accounts. Each Director may also elect to defer all or a portion of the remaining compensation and have an equivalent number of shares credited to the deferred stock account. Recipients under this plan are not required to provide consideration to us other than rendering service. Shares will be delivered as of the date a recipient ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors or within

five years

thereafter, if so elected. The plan will remain in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors or until no shares of stock remain available under the plan.

The number of common shares reserved for issuance are as follows:


Shares available for granting at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are under the 2019 Plan and 2002 Plan, respectively.


Shares reserved for issuance under the Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan are not included in the total, but are less than

1.0

million

at December 31 2019 and 2018, respectively.

We issue treasury shares upon exercise of stock options and the issuance of restricted stock and unit awards. To offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options, we periodically repurchase shares. See Note 9 –

Equity

for further discussion.



Stock-based compensation expense and the corresponding tax benefit are as follows:

Stock Options

Stock options may not be granted at a price less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options granted vest over a

four

year service period and have a maximum term of


years

. Stock option compensation costs are recognized from the date of grant, utilizing a

four

-year graded vesting method. Under this method, more than half of the costs are recognized over the first

twelve months

, approximately one-quarter of the costs are recognized over a

twenty-four

month period starting from the date of grant, approximately one-tenth of the costs are recognized over a

thirty-six

month period starting from the date of grant, and the remaining costs recognized over a

forty-eight

month period starting from the date of grant.

We use a lattice-based option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted:

Because lattice-based option-pricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions, those ranges are disclosed. These assumptions are based on multiple factors, including historical exercise patterns, post-vesting termination rates, expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price. The risk-free interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield at the date of grant. We use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.

In 2018, we made a one-time issuance of incentive stock options under the 2002 Plan to replace Kensho employees' stock options that were assumed in connection with our acquisition of Kensho in April of 2018. There were

no

stock options granted in 2019 and 2017.

Stock option activity is as follows:


There are less than 0.1 million shares forfeited and expired.




There are less than

Information regarding our stock option exercises is as follows:

Restricted Stock and Unit Awards

Restricted stock and unit awards (performance and non-performance) have been granted under the 2002 Plan and 2019 Plan. Performance unit awards will vest only if we achieve certain financial goals over the performance period. Restricted stock non-performance awards have various vesting periods (generally

three years

), with vesting beginning on the first anniversary of the awards. Recipients of restricted stock and unit awards are not required to provide consideration to us other than rendering service.

The stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and unit awards is determined based on the market price of our stock at the grant date of the award applied to the total number of awards that are anticipated to fully vest. For performance unit awards, adjustments are made to expense dependent upon financial goals achieved.

Restricted stock and unit activity for performance and non-performance awards is as follows:

Stock Repurchases

On December 4, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of


million

shares, which was approximately


%

of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time.

Our purchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. As of December 31,


,

4.7

million

shares remained available under our current share repurchase program. Our current share repurchase program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions.

We have entered into accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements with financial institutions to initiate share repurchases of our common stock. Under an ASR agreement, we pay a specified amount to the financial institution and receive an initial delivery of shares. This initial delivery of shares represents the minimum number of shares that we may receive under the agreement. Upon settlement of the ASR agreement, the financial institution delivers additional shares. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR agreement based on the volume weighted-average share price, less a discount. We account for our ASR agreements as two transactions: a stock purchase transaction and a forward stock purchase contract. The shares delivered under the ASR agreements resulted in a reduction of outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share. The repurchased shares are held in Treasury. The forward stock purchase contracts were classified as equity instruments. The ASR agreements were executed under the current share repurchase program, approved on December 4, 2013.

The terms of each ASR agreement entered for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, structured as outlined above, are as follows:


The ASR agreement was structured as a capped ASR agreement in which we paid

$


million and received an initial delivery of

1.8

million shares, representing the minimum number of shares of our common stock to be repurchased based on a calculation using a specified capped price per share.


The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid

$


million and received an initial delivery of

2.2

million shares, representing


%

of the

$


million at a price equal to the then market price of the Company.


The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid

$


million and received an initial delivery of

2.5

million shares, representing


%

of the

$


million at a price equal to the then market price of the Company.




The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $


billion and received an initial delivery of

4.5

million shares, representing


%

of the $


billion at a price equal to the then market price of the Company.


The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid

$


million and received an initial delivery of

2.8

Additionally, we purchased shares of our common stock in the open market as follows

During the year ended December 31,


, we received

5.9

million shares, including

0.4

million

shares received in January of 2019 related to our October 29, 2018 ASR agreement, resulting in

$

1,240

million

of cash used to repurchase shares. During the years ended December 31,

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

The agreement with the minority partners that own


%

of our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture contains redemption features whereby interests held by minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Specifically, under the terms of the operating agreement of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC ("CGIS") has the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least


%

of their share in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. In addition, in the event there is a change of control of the Company, for the


days following a change in control, CME Group and CGIS will have the right to put their interest to us at the then fair value of CME Group's and CGIS' minority interest.

If interests were to be redeemed under this agreement, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on the date of redemption. This interest is presented on the consolidated balance sheets outside of equity under the caption “Redeemable noncontrolling interest” with an initial value based on fair value for the portion attributable to the net assets we acquired, and based on our historical cost for the portion attributable to our S&P Index business. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using both income and market valuation approaches. Our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income.

Noncontrolling interests that do not contain such redemption features are presented in equity.

Ch

anges to redeemable noncontrolling interest during the year ended

December 31, 2019

were as follows:

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per common share ("EPS") is computed by dividing net income attributable to the common shareholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed in the same manner as basic EPS, except the number of shares is increased to include additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued. Potential common shares consist primarily of stock options and restricted performance shares calculated using the treasury stock method.

The calculation for basic and diluted EPS is as follows:

Each period we have certain stock options and restricted performance shares that are potentially excluded from the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of the potential exercise of stock options is excluded when the average market price of our common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related option during the period or when a net loss exists because the effect would have been antidilutive. Additionally, restricted performance shares are excluded because the necessary vesting conditions had not been met or when a net loss exists. As of

December 31, 2019

,


and


, there were

no

stock options excluded. Restricted performance shares outstanding of

0.4

, we continued to evaluate our cost structure and further identified cost savings associated with streamlining our management structure and our decision to exit non-strategic businesses. Our


and


restructuring plans consisted of a company-wide workforce reduction of approximately


and


positions, respectively, and are further detailed below. The charges for each restructuring plan are classified as selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income and the reserves are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

In certain circumstances, reserves are no longer needed because of efficiencies in carrying out the plans or because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were reassigned due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated. In these cases, we reverse reserves through the consolidated statements of income during the period when it is determined they are no longer needed. There were approximately

$


million

of reserves from the


restructuring plan that we have reversed in


, which offset the initial charge of

$


million

recorded for the


restructuring plan. There were approximately

Segment and Geographic Information

As discussed in Note 1 –

Accounting Policies

, we have

four

reportable segments: Ratings, Market Intelligence, Platts and Indices.

Our Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision-maker and evaluates performance of our segments and allocates resources based primarily on operating profit. Segment operating profit does not include Corporate Unallocated, other income, net, or interest expense, net, as these are costs that do not affect the operating results of our reportable segments. We use the same accounting policies for our segments as those described in Note 1 –

Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

We determine whether an arrangement meets the criteria for an operating lease or a finance lease at the inception of the arrangement.  We have operating leases for office space and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of


year

to


years

, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to


years

, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within


year

. We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of use ("ROU") assets and associated lease liabilities. We sublease certain real estate leases to third parties which mainly consist of operating leases for space within our offices.

Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expenses for these leases on a straight line-basis over the lease term in operating-related expenses and selling and general expenses.

Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Our future minimum based payments used to determine our lease liabilities include minimum based rent payments and escalations. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

The following table provides information on the location and amounts of our leases on our consolidated balance sheet as of

December 31, 2019

:

The components of lease expense for the year ended

Under the terms of the License Agreement, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC receives a share of the profits from the trading and clearing of CME Group's equity index products. During the years ended

December 31, 2019

Legal & Regulatory Matters

In the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries.

In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to ratings activities and antitrust matters. For example, as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization registered with the SEC under Section 15E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, S&P Global Ratings is in ongoing communication with the staff of the SEC regarding compliance with its extensive obligations under the federal securities laws. Although S&P Global seeks to promptly address any compliance issues that it detects or that the staff of the SEC or another regulator raises, there can be no assurance that the SEC or another regulator will not seek remedies against S&P Global for one or more compliance deficiencies. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.



In view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of such matters or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity (if any) restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that such outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we will continue to review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, management is required to provide the following report on our internal control over financial reporting:

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of the system of internal control using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework (“COSO 2013 framework”).

Other Information

IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT DISCLOSURE

Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether, during the reporting period, it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or



entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Revenue in 2019 attributable to the transactions or dealings by the Company described below was approximately $3.48 million with net profit from such sales being a fraction of the revenues.

During 2019, Platts, a division of the Company that provides energy-related information in over 150 countries, sold information and informational materials, which are generally exempt from U.S. economic sanctions, to subscribers that are owned or controlled, or appear to be owned or controlled, by the Government of Iran.  Platts provided such subscribers access to proprietary data, analytics, and industry information that enable commodities markets to perform with greater transparency and efficiency, generating revenue that was a de minimis portion of both the division's and the Company’s revenue.  The Company will continue to monitor its provision of products and services to such subscribers. As previously disclosed, during 2019 S&P Global had two relationships with customers that were designated pursuant to Executive Order 13224; the Company terminated its relationships with those entities and ceased collecting revenue relating to those relationships.
