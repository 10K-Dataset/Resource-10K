PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” the
“Registrant,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading global information services provider serving the
financial, education and business information markets with the information they need to succeed in
the “Knowledge Economy”. The business information markets include energy, automotive, construction,
aerospace and defense, broadcasting and marketing/research information services. We serve our
global customers through a broad range of products and distribution channels, including digital
data and information, integrated digital platforms, printed books, magazines and newsletters,
online via Internet Websites and through wireless and traditional on-air broadcasting, as well as
through a variety of conferences and trade shows.

In November of 2010 we realigned our previously reported Financial Services segment into two
separate segments, Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) and McGraw-Hill Financial (“MH Financial”) to drive
global growth and innovation. Specifically, the establishment of MH Financial allows us to organize
our global financial information, data and analytics on a common sales and marketing platform. S&P
will be able to focus on creating enhanced credit risk benchmarks and research for the expanding
global markets in the new and evolving regulatory environment. As a result of the reorganization,
our operations now consist of four business segments: S&P, MH Financial, McGraw-Hill Education
(“MHE”) and McGraw-Hill Information & Media (“I&M”).

Our Businesses

S&P

S&P is the world’s foremost provider of credit ratings. With offices in over 20 countries around
the world, S&P is an important part of the world’s financial infrastructure and has played a
leading role for 150 years in providing investors with information and independent benchmarks for
their investment and financial decisions and access to the financial markets. The key constituents
S&P serves are investors; corporations, governments, and municipalities; commercial and investment
banks; insurance companies; asset managers; and other debt issuers.

S&P differentiates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction, where transaction revenue
includes new issuance of corporate, public finance, and structured finance debt instruments, bank
loans, and corporate credit estimates; and non-transaction revenue includes annual fees for
customer relationship-based pricing programs, surveillance fees and ratings fees earned relating to
cancelled transactions (“breakage fees”).

Global markets have begun to recover and some are expanding rapidly, particularly those in emerging
economies such as China and India, and raising capital is key for growth. Though, some
uncertainties do remain, individuals, countries, and corporations will continue to require access
to world capital markets, and investors will demand the diversification they offer. The primary
risk point in the financial markets has moved to Europe. There was record investment-grade bond
issuance in 2010, and we have seen the re-emergence of the speculative-grade market. New financial
legislation around the world will help improve investor confidence and market stability.

MH Financial

MH Financial is a leading global provider of digital and traditional research and analytical tools
for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors. It deploys the latest
innovative technology strategies to deliver to customers an integrated portfolio of cross-asset
analytics, desktop services, valuation and index benchmarks and investment recommendations in the
rapidly growing financial information, data and analytics market. The key constituents MH Financial
serves are asset managers; investment banks; investors; brokers; financial advisors; investment
sponsors; and companies’ back-office functions, including compliance, operations, risk, clearance,
and settlement.

MH Financial differentiates its revenue between subscription and non-subscription, where
subscription revenue includes credit ratings-related information products, the Capital IQ platform,
investment research products and other data subscriptions; and non-subscription revenue includes
fees based on assets underlying exchange-traded funds as well as certain advisory, pricing and
analytical services.

The increasing interconnections among the world economies and financial markets underpin the need
for financial information. The retirement of the baby boomers in developed countries as well as the
emergence of a vast new middle class in developing countries will also increase the need for
financial services.



MHE

MHE is one of the premier global educational publishers and consists of two operating groups: the
School Education Group (“SEG”), serving the elementary and high school (“el-hi”) markets, and the
Higher Education, Professional and International Group (“HPI”), serving the college and university,
professional, international and adult education markets. As world economies become increasingly
centered on the service sector and technology and global population continues to rise, education is
more than ever the key to growth.

The el-hi market is changing with digital capabilities becoming increasingly critical. SEG sells
textbooks (print and digital versions), digital and hybrid supplemental materials and provides
online and traditional assessment and reporting services. The key markets are pre-kindergarten,
elementary, secondary, testing, supplemental, vocational, and post-secondary fields in the United
States. The market for textbooks consists of adoption states, which are states that provide
educational funding to school districts for specific programs based on adoption calendars, and open
territory states, which are states that do not follow adoption calendars. This market is influenced
strongly by the size and timing of state adoption opportunities and the availability of funds in
adoption states and in the open territory. Federal support has eased some of the pressure on state
and local finances, which has helped to mitigate the cutbacks in K-12 education.

In the college and university market, and the international market, we sell integrated digital
eLearning platforms, textbooks and other resources to higher education institutions. Key markets
are international college, university, post-graduate fields/markets, and English as a Second
Language (ESL) for higher education; worldwide medicine, healthcare, engineering, science, computer
technology, business, and general reference publishing for professional; and education, business,
and professional for international.

The college and university market is affected by enrollments, higher education funding and the
number of courses available to students. Enrollments in degree-granting higher education
institutions are projected to rise 13% to 20.6 million by 2018, according to the National Center
for Educational Statistics. Online enrollments have continued to grow at rates in excess of the
total higher education school population. Internationally, postsecondary enrollments are also
increasing in many regions, notably in India and China and other emerging economies. College
enrollments are rising more rapidly, as the need for bridging skill gaps with college-educated
workers grows. Continuing education is becoming more common, as workers may need to change careers
several times over the course of a working lifetime.

I&M

I&M consists of two operating groups: the Business-to-Business Group (“B2B”), including such brands
as Platts, J.D. Power and Associates, McGraw-Hill Construction and

Aviation Week

; and the
Broadcasting Group, which operates nine television stations, four ABC affiliated stations located
in Denver (KMGH-TV), Indianapolis (WRTV), San Diego (KGTV), and Bakersfield, California (KERO-TV);
and five Azteca America affiliated stations in Denver (KZCO-TV), Fort Collins (KZFC-TV), Colorado
Springs (KZCS-TV), San Diego (KZSD-TV) and Bakersfield, California (KZKC-TV).

Key markets served by B2B include professionals and corporate executives in automotive, aerospace
and defense, construction, and energy; and global business and financial professionals, traders,
investors, marketers, advertisers, and consumers worldwide.

The segment’s business is driven by the need for information and transparency in a variety of
industries, and to a lesser extent, by advertising revenue. I&M delivers critical information,
largely though digital channels, for the construction, aerospace and defense, automotive, and
general business markets. The recent recession has adversely affected the construction and
automobile industries. These sectors are beginning to stabilize, but recovery will be slow.
Information is the main currency of the new industrial age. Global information coverage and the
interconnections in global trade and finance demand faster and more accurate information flows.

Our Strategy

In 2011, we plan to continue our focus on the following strategies to increase our growth and
relevance and to maintain our position as a leading “Knowledge Economy” company:

Leveraging existing capabilities to grow organically, particularly through developing a broad
range of digital products and services

We employ technology to innovate, create new revenue streams, and lower operating costs. Connecting
content and managing digital assets globally is an essential part of this effort. We are building
size and scale globally in essential markets by expanding our digital capabilities to serve the
enduring needs for knowledge, capital formation, and business analysis. With the positive shift in
the global



economy, we are well-positioned for new opportunities in areas such as financial
services, digital education solutions and sustainability-related products and services.

Since 2002, our year-over-year revenue growth from abroad has outpaced domestic performance. In
2010, foreign sources accounted for approximately 29% of our total revenue. The rapid rise of
developing economies in Asia, including India, is creating significant opportunities for us.

•

S&P — CRISIL launched a new service, Independent Equity Research (“IER”), providing
investors with high-quality research on listed Indian companies. CRISIL is India’s leading
provider of ratings, research, and risk and policy advisory services. S&P launched the
ASEAN Regional Rating Scale to facilitate increased regional and global market
participation in Southeast Asia.

•

MH Financial — has forged relationships with leading stock exchanges around the world,
including the Australian Securities Exchange, the National Stock Exchange of India, the
Toronto Stock Exchange, and the RTS Exchange in Moscow, to calculate and manage local stock
indices.

•

MHE — is capitalizing on the global demand for knowledge, particularly in vocational
and English language training and online instruction. In India, Tata McGraw-Hill, a joint
venture between Tata Group and MHE, launched a professional development program for India’s
growing retail industry. In China, MHE has partnered with Ambow Education, a market leader
in vocational training services, to develop new English-language training programs for
Chinese engineers. In the United Arab Emirates, MHE has developed custom assessments for
English-language proficiency training.

•

I&M — Platts is expanding by bringing information transparency critical to growing
markets for national resources around the world. J.D. Power and Associates continues to
deepen its offering and expand its services internationally, including in China, where the
automotive market is growing rapidly.

AviationWeek

continues to expand in the defense
sector as well as in emerging markets, including India, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific.

Growing globally by leveraging our position in developed markets and by pursuing opportunities
in key developing countries

We will increase our global footprint and revenues by scaling up and localizing key global
platforms, building and acquiring new capabilities and products, and accelerating cross-border
distribution of existing products. We will accomplish this by successfully operating on global,
regional and local levels.

Continuing to consider selective acquisitions that complement our existing business
capabilities

We are focused on growth opportunities in core markets — financial services, education and
business information. Our four operating segments help meet the need for knowledge and education,
provide access to the world’s capital markets, and increase information transparency for better
decision making.

Expanding and refining the use of technology in all segments to improve performance, market
penetration and productivity

Connecting content and managing digital assets globally across all of our companies is essential to
growing revenue, improving workflow and productivity, and reducing costs. Ongoing investments in
technology support our ability to provide our customers with products and services that deliver
solutions and that represent the shift to today’s more interactive and digital business model.
Technology represents a tremendous opportunity for us to enhance our offerings, embed our solutions
into customers’ workflows and infrastructure, and build stronger, broader relationships.

•

S&P — continues to facilitate worldwide access to capital by providing a common and
transparent benchmark for evaluating and comparing creditworthiness across multiple sectors
and geographies.

•

MH Financial — Capital IQ’s platform of powerful, easy-to-use tools is attracting more
clients and helping them reduce risk, work more efficiently, and make better decisions. S&P
Indices, the world’s leading index provider, is continuing to expand in global markets.

•

MHE — is embracing digital to create new and expanded revenue opportunities.
McGraw-Hill Connect™, MHE’s innovative higher education platform, and other digital
study/homework management products now have more than 1.8 million registered users. A new
partnership with Blackboard Inc. will significantly expand access to McGraw-Hill Connect by
making McGraw-Hill’s content and digital tools available to institutions already using
Blackboard Learn™. MHE’s digital tools and content are available on a variety of devices
developed by Apple, Amazon and Sony to broaden its digital distribution. A new partnership
with Wipro Technologies to develop “mConnect”, an open-standard mobile learning platform,
will help to bridge the skills gap in emerging markets with the intention to extend this
program to other countries in Asia and in Africa.

•

I&M — our leading business information brands are taking the creation, analysis, and
delivery of business information to new levels. J.D. Power and Associates is providing
real-time data and volume metrics to the automotive, hospitality, and retail industries.
Platts is expanding as the demand for natural resources grows globally and the need for
information about these volatile markets increases.



There can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these
strategies. The following factors could unfavorably impact operating results in 2011:

•

Lower educational funding as a result of state budget concerns

•

Prolonged difficulties in the credit markets

•

A change in the regulatory environment affecting our businesses

•

A change in educational spending

Item 1a.

Risk Factors

We are providing the following cautionary statements which identify all known material risks,
uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from
historical and expected results.

We operate
in the financial, education, and business information markets. The
business information  markets
include energy; automotive; construction; aerospace and defense;
broadcasting; and marketing/research
information services. Certain risk factors are applicable to individual markets while other risk
factors are applicable company-wide.

Company-wide Risk Factors

Our ability to grow is dependent on a number of factors including the following:

Introduction of new products, services or technologies could impact our profitability

•

We operate in highly competitive markets that continue to change to adapt to customer
needs. In order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new
offerings and new ways to deliver our products and services.

o

These investments may not be profitable or may be less profitable than
what we have experienced historically.

•

We could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors
due to the rapidly changing environment within which we operate.

•

We rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases,
systems and applications to support key product and service offerings. We believe we have
appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our
information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and
maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption
and our operating results may be adversely impacted by unanticipated system failures, data
corruption or unauthorized access to our systems.



A significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our
profitability

•

Our major expenses include employee compensation and printing, paper, and distribution
costs for product-related manufacturing.

Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position

•

Our products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of media,
including print, broadcast and digital. Our ability to achieve anticipated results depends
in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property against infringement. Our
operating results may be adversely affected by inadequate legal and technological
protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and
markets.

Exposure to litigation could have a material effect on our financial position and results of
operations

•

We are involved in legal actions and claims arising from our business practices, as
discussed in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of our 2010 Annual Report to
Shareholders, and face the risk that additional actions and claims will be filed in the
future. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any
particular legal proceeding or change in applicable legal standards could have a material
effect on our financial position and results of operations.

Risk of doing business abroad

•

As we continue to expand our operations overseas, we face the increased risks of doing
business abroad, including inflation, fluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange
rates, changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, export and import
restrictions, tariffs, nationalization, expropriation, limits on repatriation of funds,
civil unrest, terrorism, unstable governments and legal systems, and other factors.
Adverse developments in any of these areas could cause actual results to differ materially
from historical and/or expected operating results.

Risk Factors Specific to our Standard & Poor’s Segment

Changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and/or global capital markets and
changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets could have a material
impact on our results of operations

•

Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt
securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce
the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which S&P provides credit
ratings.

•

Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the
interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of
significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general
level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and/or
the types of credit-sensitive products being offered.

•

A sustained period of market decline or weakness could have a material adverse effect on
us.

•

Our results could be adversely affected because of public statements or actions by
market participants, government officials and others who may be advocates of increased
regulation, regulatory scrutiny or litigation.

Increased competition or regulation could result in a loss of market share or revenue

•

The markets for credit ratings are very competitive. S&P competes domestically and
internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its ratings,
client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological
innovation.



•

In addition, in some of the countries in which S&P competes, governments may provide
financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies and may from time to time
establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for
evaluating local issuers.

•

The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increasing regulation in
the United States and abroad. The businesses conducted by S&P are in certain cases
regulated under the U.S. Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006, the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they
conduct business.

o

In the past several years the U.S. Congress, the SEC, the European Commission, through the Committee of European
Securities Regulators  and the International
Organization of Securities Commissions, a global group of securities
commissioners, have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and
the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit
ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies.

o

Local, national and multinational bodies have considered and adopted
other legislation and regulations relating to credit rating agencies from time to
time.

§

We do not believe that any such laws, regulations or rules will have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

o

Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are
being considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely
to continue to be considered in the future. The impact on us of the adoption of any
such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain.

o

Additional information regarding rating agencies is provided in the
Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of our 2010 Annual Report to
Shareholders.

Risk Factors Specific to our McGraw-Hill Financial Segment

Increased competition or regulation could result in a loss of market share or revenue

•

The markets for financial research, investment and advisory services are very
competitive. MH Financial competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a
number of factors, including the quality of its research and advisory services, client
service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and services, and
technological innovation.

•

The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increasing regulation in
the United States and abroad. The businesses conducted by MH Financial are in certain cases
regulated under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct
business.

o

We do not believe that any such laws, regulations or rules will have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

o

In the future, other laws, regulations and rules relating to financial information may
be considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies.

o

Additional information regarding MH Financial is provided in the
Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of our 2010 Annual Report to
Shareholders.

Consolidation of customers could impact our available markets and revenue growth

•

Our businesses within our MH Financial segment have a customer base which is largely
comprised of members from the financial services industry. The current challenging business
environment and the consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions in
the financial services industry can result in reductions in the number of firms and
workforce which can impact the size of our customer base.

Risk Factors Specific to our McGraw-Hill Education Segment

Changes in educational funding could materially affect our education businesses

•

Our U.S. educational textbook and testing businesses may be adversely affected by
changes in state educational funding as a result of changes in legislation, both at the
federal and state level, changes in the state procurement process and changes in the
condition of the local, state or U.S. economy.

•

While in the past few years the availability of state and federal funding for elementary
and high school education had improved due to legislative mandates such as No Child Left
Behind  and Reading First, future changes in federal funding and the state and
local tax base could create an unfavorable environment, leading to budget issues resulting
in a decrease in educational funding.

Our education businesses operate in a cyclical environment

•

A significant portion of our sales are to customers in educational markets. Our School
Education Group and the industry it serves are influenced strongly by the magnitude and
timing of state adoption opportunities. Approximately 20 states currently use an adoption
process to purchase textbooks. In the remaining states, known as “open territories”,
textbooks are



purchased independently by local districts or individual schools. There is no
guarantee that we will be successful in the state new adoption market or in open
territories.

Risk
Factors Specific to our McGraw-Hill Information & Media Segment

Changes in the global advertising markets could materially impact our results

•

Although advertising is less than 5% of our revenue, advertising is still a significant
source of revenue in our I&M  segment. In general, demand for advertising
tends to correlate with changes in the level of economic activity in the United States and
in the markets we serve. In addition, world, national and local events may affect
advertising demand.

•

Competition from other forms of media such as other magazines, broadcasters and Web
sites, affects our ability to attract and retain advertisers.

Our broadcasting operations are subject to regulatory development that could affect their
profitability

•

All television stations are subject to Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”)
regulation. Television stations broadcast under licenses that are generally granted and
renewed for a period of eight years. The FCC regulates television station operations in
several ways, including, but not limited to, employment practices, political advertising,
indecency and obscenity, sponsorship identification, children’s programming,
issue-responsive programming, signal carriage, ownership, and engineering, transmissions,
antenna and other technical matters.

Changes in the global automotive markets

•

Declines in the global automotive industry impacts our ability to sustain or grow our
revenue streams associated with business intelligence to that market.

Properties

Our corporate headquarters are located in leased premises located at 1221 Avenue of the Americas,
New York, NY 10020. We lease office facilities at 212 locations: 111 are in the United States. In
addition, we own real property at 21 locations, of which 11 are in the United States. Our
properties consist primarily of office space used by each of our segments. Our MHE segment also
utilizes warehouse space and book distribution centers. We believe that all of our facilities are
well maintained and are suitable and adequate for our current needs.

We expect to continue our policy of paying regular cash dividends, although there is no assurance
as to future dividend payments because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements and our
financial condition.

On January 31, 2007 the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the
purchase of up to 45.0 million shares, which was 12.7% of the total shares of our outstanding
common stock at that time. During the 2010, we repurchased 8.7 million shares under the 2007
repurchase program. We did not purchase any shares during the three months ended December 31, 2010.
As of December 31, 2010, 8.4 million shares remained available under the 2007 repurchase program.
The repurchase program has no expiration date. The repurchased shares may be used for general
corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the
dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. Purchases under this program may be made
from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions.

incorporated herein by reference from Exhibits (31.1) and (31.2) to this Annual Report on Form
10-K. In addition we have filed the required certifications under Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 incorporated herein by reference from Exhibit (32) to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
After the 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, we intend to file with the NYSE the CEO certification regarding our compliance with the NYSE’s corporate governance
listing standards as required by NYSE rule 303A.12. Last year, we filed this CEO certification with
the NYSE on April 29, 2010.

This Item 9a. includes information concerning the controls and control evaluations referred to in
the required certifications.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

As of December 31, 2010, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, management, including
the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
December 31, 2010.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002  and as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, management is required to provide the
following report on our internal control over financial reporting:

1.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting.

2.

Management has evaluated the system of internal control using the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) framework. Management has
selected the COSO framework for its evaluation as it is a control framework recognized by
the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that is free from bias, permits
reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurement of our internal controls, is
sufficiently complete so that relevant controls are not omitted and is relevant to an
evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting.

3.

Based on management’s evaluation under this framework, management has concluded that
our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2010.
There are no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that have
been identified by management.

4.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited our
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010, and has issued
their reports on the financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting. These reports are located on pages 69 and 70 of the 2010 Annual
Report to Shareholders.

Other Matters

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Included in this number are 264,466 shares reserved for issuance under the

issuance under the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2002 Plan”) for Performance Stock,

The 2002 Plan is also governed by certain share recapture provisions. The aggregate number of
shares of stock available under the 2002 Plan for issuance are increased by the number of shares of
stock granted as an award under the 2002 Plan or 1993 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “1993
Plan”) that are:
