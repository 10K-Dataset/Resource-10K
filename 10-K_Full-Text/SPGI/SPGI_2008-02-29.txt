Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

A writ of summons was served on The McGraw-Hill Companies, SRL and on The
McGraw-Hill Companies, SA (both indirect subsidiaries of the Company)
(collectively, “Standard & Poor’s”) on September 29, 2005 and October 7,
2005, respectively, in an action brought in the Tribunal of Milan, Italy by
Enrico Bondi (“Bondi”), the Extraordinary Commissioner of Parmalat
Finanziaria S.p.A. and Parmalat S.p.A. (collectively, “Parmalat”). Bondi
has brought numerous other lawsuits in both Italy and the United States
against entities and individuals who had dealings with Parmalat. In this
suit, Bondi claims that Standard & Poor’s, which had issued investment
grade ratings on Parmalat until shortly before Parmalat’s collapse in
December 2003, breached its duty to issue an independent and professional
rating and negligently and knowingly assigned inflated ratings in order to
retain Parmalat’s business. Alleging joint and several liability, Bondi
claims damages of euros 4,073,984,120 (representing the value of bonds
issued by Parmalat and the rating fees paid by Parmalat) with interest,
plus damages to be ascertained for Standard & Poor’s alleged complicity in
aggravating Parmalat’s financial difficulties and/or for having contributed
in bringing about Parmalat’s indebtedness towards its bondholders, and
legal fees. The Company believes that Bondi’s allegations and claims for
damages lack legal or factual merit. Standard & Poor’s filed its answer,
counterclaim and third-party claims on March 16, 2006 and will continue to
vigorously contest the action.

In a separate proceeding, the prosecutor’s office in Parma, Italy is
conducting an investigation into the bankruptcy of Parmalat. In June 2006,
the prosecutor’s office issued a Note of Completion of an Investigation
(“Note of Completion”) concerning allegations, based on Standard & Poor’s
investment grade ratings of Parmalat, that individual Standard & Poor’s
rating analysts conspired with Parmalat insiders and rating advisors to
fraudulently or negligently cause the Parmalat bankruptcy. The Note of
Completion was served on eight Standard & Poor’s rating analysts. While
not a formal charge, the Note of Completion indicates the prosecutor’s
intention that the named rating analysts should appear before a judge in
Parma for a preliminary hearing, at which hearing the judge will determine
whether there is sufficient evidence against the rating analysts to proceed
to trial. No date has been set for the preliminary hearing. On July 7,
2006, a defense brief was filed with the Parma prosecutor’s office on
behalf of the rating analysts. The Company believes that there is no basis
in fact or law to support the allegations against the rating analysts, and
they will be vigorously defended by the subsidiaries involved.

The Company has learned that on August 9, 2007 a pro se action titled

Blomquist v. Washington Mutual, et al

., was filed in the District Court for
the Northern District of California against numerous financial
institutions, government agencies and individuals, including the Company
and Mr. Harold McGraw III, the CEO of the Company, alleging various state
and federal claims. The claims against the Company and Mr. McGraw concern
Standard & Poor’s ratings of subprime mortgage-backed securities. An
amended Complaint was filed in the

Blomquist

action on September 10, 2007
which added two other rating agencies as defendants. On February 19, 2008
the Company was served with the Complaint. In addition, the Company has
learned that on August 28, 2007 a putative shareholder class action titled

Reese v. Bahash

, was filed in the District Court for the District of
Columbia against Mr. Robert Bahash, the CFO of the Company, alleging claims
under the federal securities laws and state tort law concerning Standard &
Poor’s ratings, particularly its ratings of subprime mortgage-backed
securities. Mr. Bahash has not been served with the Complaint. On
February 11, 2008, the District Court in the

Reese

matter entered an order
appointing a lead plaintiff in that action and permitting plaintiffs to
amend the Complaint on or before April 16, 2008 to add additional
defendants. The Company believes both Complaints to be without merit and
intends to vigorously defend in the event that service is effected.

In addition, in the normal course of business both in the United States and
abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal
proceedings and are involved, from time to time, in governmental and
self-regulatory agency proceedings, which may result in adverse judgments,
damages, fines or penalties. Also, various governmental and self-regulatory
agencies regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Based on information
currently known by the Company’s management, the Company does not believe
that any pending legal, governmental or self-regulatory proceedings or
investigations will result in a material adverse effect on its financial
condition or results of operations.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief
Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

As of December 31, 2007, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and
with the participation of the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management,
including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of December 31, 2007.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Section 404) and as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
management is required to provide the following report on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting:

1.

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
Company.

2.

The Company’s management has evaluated the system of
internal control using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (“COSO”) framework. Management has selected the COSO
framework for its evaluation as it is a control framework recognized by the
SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that is free from
bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative
measurement of the Company’s internal controls, is sufficiently complete so
that relevant controls are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of
internal controls over financial reporting.



3.

Based on management’s evaluation under this framework, we
have concluded that the Company’s internal controls over financial
reporting were effective as of December 31, 2007. There are no material
weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that
have been identified by management.

4.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
firm, Ernst & Young LLP, have audited the consolidated financial statements
of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2007, and have issued their
reports on the financial statements and the effectiveness of internal
controls over financial reporting. These reports are located on pages 77
and 78 of the 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders.

Other Matters

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting during the most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

Included in this number are 31,837,143 shares to be issued upon

and 211,472 deferred units already credited but to be issued under the
Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan.

(2)

Included in this number are 559,953 shares reserved for
issuance under the Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan. The remaining
23,025,842 shares are reserved for issuance under the 2002 Stock Incentive
Plan (the “2002 Plan”) for Performance Stock, Restricted Stock, Other
Stock-Based Awards, Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”).

(3)

Under the terms of the 2002 Plan, shares subject to an award
(other than a stock option, SAR, or dividend equivalent) or shares paid in
settlement of a dividend equivalent reduce the number of shares available
under the 2002 Plan by one share for each such share granted or paid;
shares subject to a stock option or SAR reduce the number of shares
available under the 2002 Plan by one-third of a share for each such share
granted. The 2002 Plan stipulates that in no case, as a result of such
share counting, may more than 19,000,000 shares of stock be issued
thereunder. Accordingly, for purposes of setting forth the figures in this
column, the base figure from which issuances of stock awards are deducted,
is deemed to be 19,000,000 shares for the 2002 Plan plus shares reserved
for grant immediately prior to the amendments to the 2002 Plan of April
28, 2004.

The 2002 Plan is also governed by certain share recapture provisions. The
aggregate number of shares of stock available under the 2002 Plan for
issuance are increased by the number of shares of stock granted as an award
under the 2002 Plan or 1993 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “1993
Plan”)(other than stock option, SAR or 1993 Plan stock option awards) or by
one-third of the number of shares of stock in the case of stock option, SAR
or 1993 Plan stock option awards that are, in each case: forfeited, settled
in cash or property other than stock, or otherwise not distributable under an
award under the Plan; tendered or withheld to pay the exercise or purchase
price of an award under the 2002 or 1993 Plans or to satisfy applicable wage
or other required tax withholding in connection with the exercise, vesting or
payment of, or other event related to, an award under the 2002 or 1993 Plan;
or repurchased by the Company with the option proceeds in respect of the
exercise of a stock option under the 2002 or 1993 Plans.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

Incorporated herein by reference from the Registrant’s definitive proxy
statement dated March 20, 2008 for the annual meeting of shareholders to
be held April 30, 2008.

On March 30, 2006, as part of its previously announced stock buyback
program, the Company acquired 8.4 million shares of the Corporation’s
stock from the holdings of the recently deceased William H. McGraw. The
shares were purchased through the mixture of available cash and borrowings
at a discount of approximately 2.4% from the March 30th New York Stock
Exchange closing price through a private transaction with Mr. McGraw’s
estate. This transaction closed on April 5, 2006 and the total purchase
amount of $468.8 million was funded through a combination of cash on hand
and borrowings in the commercial paper market. The transaction was
approved by the Financial Policy and Audit Committees of the Company’s
Board of Directors, and the Corporation received independent financial and
legal advice concerning the purchase.
