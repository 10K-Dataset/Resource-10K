Legal Proceedings

A writ of summons was served on The McGraw-Hill Companies, SRL and on The McGraw-Hill
Companies, SA (both indirect subsidiaries of the Company) (collectively, “Standard &
Poor’s”) on September 29, 2005 and October 7, 2005, respectively, in an action
brought in the Tribunal of Milan, Italy by Enrico Bondi (“Bondi”), the Extraordinary
Commissioner of Parmalat Finanziaria S.p.A. and Parmalat S.p.A. (collectively,
“Parmalat”). Bondi has brought numerous other lawsuits in both Italy and the United States against
entities and individuals who had dealings with Parmalat. In this suit, Bondi claims
that Standard & Poor’s, which had issued investment grade ratings



on Parmalat until shortly before Parmalat’s collapse in December 2003, breached its duty to issue an
independent and professional rating and negligently and knowingly assigned inflated
ratings in order to retain Parmalat’s business. Alleging joint and several
liability, Bondi claims damages of euros 4,073,984,120 (representing the value of
bonds issued by Parmalat and the rating fees paid by Parmalat) with interest, plus
damages to be ascertained for Standard & Poor’s alleged complicity in aggravating
Parmalat’s financial difficulties and/or for having contributed in bringing about
Parmalat’s indebtedness towards its bondholders, and legal fees. The Company
believes that Bondi’s allegations and claims for damages lack legal or factual merit.
Standard & Poor’s filed its answer, counterclaim and third-party claims on March 16,
2006 and will continue to vigorously contest the action. The next hearing in this
matter is scheduled to be held in October 2009.







In addition, in the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad,
the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are
involved, from time to time, in governmental and self-regulatory agency proceedings,
which may result in adverse judgments, damages, fines or penalties. Also, various
governmental and self-regulatory agencies regularly make inquiries and conduct
investigations concerning compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Based on
information currently known by the Company’s management, the Company does not believe
that any pending legal, governmental or self-regulatory proceedings or investigations
will result in a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
operations.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

As of December 31, 2008, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with
the participation of the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of
1934). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the CEO and
CFO, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of December 31, 2008.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Section 404) and as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, management
is required to provide the following report on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting:

1. The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting for the Company.

2. The Company’s management has evaluated the system of internal control using the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) framework.
Management has selected the COSO framework for its evaluation as it is a control
framework recognized by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
that is free from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative
measurement of the Company’s internal controls, is sufficiently complete so that
relevant controls are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal
controls over financial reporting.

3. Based on management’s evaluation under this framework, we have concluded that the
Company’s internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December
31, 2008. There are no material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting that have been identified by management.

4. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP,
have audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended
December 31, 2008, and have issued their reports on the financial statements and the
effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. These reports are
located on pages 79 and 80 of the 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders.



Other Matters

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
during the most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Included in this number are 32,469,495 shares to be issued upon
exercise of outstanding options under the Company’s Stock Incentive Plans
and 251,941 deferred units already credited but to be issued under the
Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan.

(2)

Included in this number are 304,490 shares reserved for
issuance under the Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan. The remaining
20,525,617 shares are reserved for issuance under the 2002 Stock Incentive
Plan (the “2002 Plan”) for Performance Stock, Restricted Stock, Other
Stock-Based Awards, Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”).

(3)

Under the terms of the 2002 Plan, shares subject to an award
(other than a stock option, SAR, or dividend equivalent) or shares paid in
settlement of a dividend equivalent reduce the number of shares available
under the 2002 Plan by one share for each such



share granted or paid;
shares subject to a stock option or SAR reduce the number of shares
available under the 2002 Plan by one-third of a share for each such share
granted. The 2002 Plan stipulates that in no case, as a result of such
share counting, may more than 19,000,000 shares of stock be issued
thereunder. Accordingly, for purposes of setting forth the figures in this
column, the base figure from which issuances of stock awards are deducted,
is deemed to be 19,000,000 shares for the 2002 Plan plus shares reserved
for grant immediately prior to the amendments to the 2002 Plan of April
28, 2004.

The 2002 Plan is also governed by certain share recapture provisions. The
aggregate number of shares of stock available under the 2002 Plan for
issuance are increased by the number of shares of stock granted as an award
under the 2002 Plan or 1993 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “1993
Plan”)(other than stock option, SAR or 1993 Plan stock option awards) or by
one-third of the number of shares of stock in the case of stock option, SAR
or 1993 Plan stock option awards that are, in each case: forfeited, settled
in cash or property other than stock, or otherwise not distributable under an
award under the Plan; tendered or withheld to pay the exercise or purchase
price of an award under the 2002 or 1993 Plans or to satisfy applicable wage
or other required tax withholding in connection with the exercise, vesting or
payment of, or other event related to, an award under the 2002 or 1993 Plan;
or repurchased by the Company with the option proceeds in respect of the
exercise of a stock option under the 2002 or 1993 Plans.
