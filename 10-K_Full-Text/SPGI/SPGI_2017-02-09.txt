FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements,” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements, which express management’s current views concerning future events, trends, contingencies or results, appear at various places in this report and use words like “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “future,” “intend,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “strategy,” “target” and similar terms, and future or conditional tense verbs like “could,” “may,” “might,” “should,” “will” and “would.” For example, management may use forward-looking statements when addressing topics such as: the outcome of contingencies; future actions by regulators; changes in the Company’s business strategies and methods of generating revenue; the development and performance of the Company’s services and products; the expected impact of acquisitions and dispositions; the Company’s effective tax rates; and the Company’s cost structure, dividend policy, cash flows or liquidity.

Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements include, among other things:

•

the level of merger and acquisition activity in the United States and abroad;

•

the volatility of the energy marketplace and the health of the commodities markets;

•

our ability to attract, incentivize and retain key employees;

•

the Company’s ability to successfully recover should it experience a disaster or other business continuity problem from a hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber-attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event;

•

changes in applicable tax or accounting requirements, including potential tax reform under the current U.S. administration;

•

the level of the Company’s future cash flows and capital investments;

•

the impact on the Company’s revenue and net income caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and

•

the Company’s exposure to potential criminal sanctions or civil penalties if it fails to comply with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable in the domestic and international jurisdictions in which it operates, including sanctions laws relating to countries such as Iran, Russia, Sudan and Syria, anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, as well as import and export restrictions.

The factors noted above are not exhaustive. The Company and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks emerge frequently. Accordingly, the Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which it is made, except as required by applicable law. Further information about the Company’s businesses, including information about factors that could materially affect its results of operations and financial condition, is contained in the Company’s filings with the SEC, including Item 1a,

PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

S&P Global Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading  provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide.  The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, and issuers; and the commodity markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, petrochemicals and agriculture. We serve our global customers through a broad range of products and services available through both third-party and proprietary distribution channels. We were incorporated in December of 1925 under the laws of the state of New York.

On April 27, 2016, we changed our name to S&P Global Inc. from McGraw Hill Financial, Inc.

We have repositioned S&P Global as a more focused company in the capital and commodity markets by exiting non-core assets and investing for growth in markets that have size and scale. In 2016, we continued to create a portfolio focused on scalable, industry leading, interrelated businesses in the capital and commodity markets. A discussion of significant changes that were made to our portfolio during the three years ended December 31, 2016 can be found within “MD&A – Overview” contained in Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Businesses

Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Ratings, Market and Commodities Intelligence and S&P Dow Jones Indices ("Indices"). For a discussion on the competitive conditions in our businesses, see “MD&A – Segment Review” contained in Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Effective beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of these segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts are included in a new reportable segment named Market and Commodities Intelligence. Our historical segment reporting has been retroactively revised to reflect the current organizational structure.

Ratings

Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics to investors, issuers and other market participants. Credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the debt issue may default.

With offices in over 25 countries around the world, Ratings is an important part of the world's financial infrastructure and has played a leading role for over 150 years in providing investors with information and independent benchmarks for their investment and financial decisions as well as access to the capital markets. The key constituents Ratings serves are investors, corporations, governments, municipalities, commercial and investment banks, insurance companies, asset managers, and other debt issuers.

As the capital markets continue to evolve, Ratings is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities, driven by continuing regulatory changes, through its global network, well-established position in corporate markets and strong investor reputation.

Ratings differentiates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:

•

ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, and structured finance debt instruments;

•

bank loan ratings; and

•

corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of a company which does not currently have a Ratings credit rating.



Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics.

Market and Commodities Intelligence

Market and Commodities Intelligence's portfolio of capabilities are designed to help the financial community track performance, generate better investment returns, identify new trading and investment ideas, perform risk analysis, develop mitigation strategies and provide high-value information to the commodity and energy markets that enable its customers to make better informed trading and business decisions. The key constituents Market and Commodities Intelligence serves are asset managers; investment banks; investors; brokers; financial advisors; insurance companies; investment sponsors; companies’ back-office functions, including compliance, operations, risk, clearance, and settlement; and producers, traders, and intermediaries within energy, metals and agriculture markets.

Market and Commodities Intelligence includes the following business lines:

•

Financial Data & Analytics

—

a product suite that provides data, analytics and third-party research for global finance professionals, which includes the S&P Capital IQ Desktop, SNL, Leveraged Commentary & Data, Investment Advisory and integrated bulk data feeds that can be customized, which include CUSIP and Compustat;

•

Risk Services

—

commercial arm that sells Ratings' credit ratings and related data, analytics and research, which includes subscription-based offerings, RatingsDirect® and RatingsXpress®; and

•

S&P Global Platts

—

the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets. S&P Global Platts provides essential price data, analytics, and industry insight that enable the commodities and energy markets to perform with greater transparency and efficiency. Additionally, S&P Global Platts generates revenue from licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges.

As of September 7, 2016, we completed the sale of J.D. Power and the results are included in Market and Commodities Intelligence results through that date.

Indices

Indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of indices to meet an array of investor needs. Indices’ mission is to provide transparent benchmarks to help with decision making, collaborate with the financial community to create innovative products and provide investors with tools to monitor world markets.

Indices primarily derives revenue from asset linked fees based on the S&P and Dow Jones indices and to a lesser extent generates subscription revenue and transaction revenue. Specifically, Indices generates revenue from the following sources:

•

Investment vehicles

—

asset linked fees such as exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) and mutual funds, that are based on S&P Dow Jones Indices' benchmarks and generate revenue through fees based on assets and underlying funds;

•

Exchange traded derivatives

—

generate royalties based on trading volumes of derivatives contracts listed on various exchanges;

•

Index-related licensing fees

—

fixed or variable annual and per-issue fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products; and

•

Data and customized index subscription fees

—

fees from supporting index fund management, portfolio analytics and research.

Item 1a.

Risk Factors

We are providing the following cautionary statements which identify all known material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical and expected results.

We operate in the capital, commodities and commercial markets. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, and issuers; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, petrochemicals and agriculture; and the commercial markets include professionals and corporate executives within automotive, financial services, insurance and marketing / research information services. Certain risk factors are applicable to certain of our individual segments while other risk factors are applicable company-wide.

Exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

In the normal course of business, both in the United States and abroad, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries, as discussed under Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 13 -

Commitments and Contingencies

to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8,

Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we face the risk that additional proceedings, investigations and inquiries will arise in the future.

•

Many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of S&P Global Ratings brought by issuers and alleged purchasers of rated securities. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to ratings activities and antitrust matters.

•

Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

In view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of the matters we are currently facing or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that the outcome of the matters we are currently facing or that we may face in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we continuously review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business and competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.

•

Legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the Company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues.

•

Risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the United States. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements,



thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations against the Company in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

We may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results.

•

We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen our business and grow our Company.  Such transactions present significant challenges and risks.

•

The market for acquisition targets and other strategic transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect our ability to complete such transactions.

•

If we are unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

•

If such transactions are completed, the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. For instance, the process of integration may require more resources than anticipated, we may assume unintended liabilities, there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures, we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business and such transactions may divert management’s focus from other business operations.

•

The anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. As a result, the failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Changes in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic and/or global capital markets, asset levels and flows into investment products, changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets, and volatility in the commodities markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

Our business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the United States and world financial markets. Therefore, since a significant component of our credit-rating based revenue is transaction-based, and is essentially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets, unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which Ratings provides credit ratings.

•

Our Indices business is impacted by market volatility, asset levels of investment products tracking indices, and trading volumes of certain exchange traded derivatives. A decrease in our revenues attributable to these products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Volatile capital markets, as well as changing investment styles, among other factors, may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an index-linked investment product.

•

Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, the level of derivatives trading and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

Our Platts business is impacted by volatility in the commodities markets.  Weak economic conditions, especially in our key markets, including the energy industry, could reduce demand for our products, impacting our revenues and margins.  As a result of volatility in commodity prices and trading activity in physical commodities and commodities derivatives, we may encounter difficulty in achieving sustained market acceptance of past or future contract terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

•

Any weakness in the macroeconomic environment could constrain customer budgets across the markets we serve, potentially leading to a reduction in their employee headcount and a decrease in demand for our subscription-based products.

Increasing regulation of our Ratings business in the United States, Europe and elsewhere can increase our costs of doing business and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

The financial services industry is highly regulated, rapidly evolving and subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. The businesses conducted by Ratings are in certain cases regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the “Reform Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer



Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.

•

In the past several years, the U.S. Congress, the International Organization of Securities Commissions ("IOSCO"), the SEC and the European Commission, including through the European Securities Market Authority ("ESMA"), as well as regulators in other countries in which Ratings operates, have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies.

•

These laws and regulations, and any future rulemaking, could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs, which we may be unable to pass through to customers. In addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. We may be required to incur significant expenses in order to comply with such laws and regulations and to mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions. Legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability. It is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on our business and our customers’ businesses, and they may affect Ratings’ communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which Ratings’ ratings are developed, affect the manner in which Ratings or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business. Each of these developments increases the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized.

•

Additional information regarding rating agencies is provided under Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Indices and Market and Commodities Intelligence businesses are subject to the potential for increased or changing regulation in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, which can increase our costs of doing business globally and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

In addition to the extensive and evolving U.S. laws and regulations, foreign jurisdictions, principally in Europe, have taken measures to increase regulation of the financial services and commodities industries.

•

In October of 2012, IOSCO issued its Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies ("PRA Principles"), which IOSCO states are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments that are referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members. Platts has taken steps to align its operations with the PRA Principles and, as recommended by IOSCO in its final report on the PRA Principles, has aligned to the PRA Principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks.

•

In July of 2013, IOSCO issued its Principles for Financial Benchmarks ("Financial Benchmark Principles"), which are intended to promote the reliability of benchmark determinations, and address governance, benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices published by Indices. Indices has taken steps to align its governance regime and operations with the Financial Benchmark Principles and engaged an independent auditor to perform a reasonable assurance review of such alignment.

•

The financial benchmarks industry is subject to the new pending benchmark regulation in the European Union (the “E.U. Benchmark Regulation”) as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions, including Australia.  The E.U. Benchmark Regulation was published on June 30, 2016 and included provisions applicable to Indices and Platts, which will become effective January 1, 2018. The E.U. Benchmark Regulation requires Indices and Platts in due course to obtain registration or authorization in connection with their respective benchmark activities in Europe. This legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time, although the exact impact remains unclear.

•

The European Union has recently finalized a package of legislative measures known as MiFID II ("MiFID II"), which revise and update the existing E.U. Markets in Financial Instruments Directive framework. MiFID II applies in full in all E.U. Member States as of January 3, 2017. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things: (i) impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation; and (iv) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the E.U. Market Infrastructure Regulation of 2011). Although the MiFID II package is “framework” legislation (meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures to be agreed upon in the period before 2017), it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect Indices’ and Platts’ abilities both to administer and license their indices and price assessments, respectively.  MiFID II and the Market Abuse Regulation (“MAR”) may impose additional regulatory



burdens on Market and Commodities Intelligence's activities in the European Union, although the exact severity and cost are not yet known.

•

Market and Commodities Intelligence operates regulated investment advisory businesses in the United States, the European Union and Malaysia. These and other Market and Commodities Intelligence businesses may increasingly become subject to new or more stringent regulations that will increase the cost of doing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Future legislation, regulatory reform or policy changes under the current U.S. administration could have a material effect on our business and results of operations.

•

There exists the potential for comprehensive tax reform in the United States that may significantly change the tax rules applicable to U.S. domiciled corporations.  Changes such as lower corporate tax rates, repatriation allowances, removal of the interest expense deduction, removal of the municipal bond tax exemption or the introduction of a border adjustment tax could impact the Company as a U.S. taxpayer, as well as the demand for our products and services.  At this time, we cannot assess what the overall effect of such potential legislation could be on our results of operations or cash flows.

•

Other legislation, regulatory reform or policy changes under the current U.S. administration, such as financial services regulatory reform, U.S. oil deregulation, government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) reform and increased infrastructure spending, could impact our business.  At this time, we cannot predict the scope or nature of these changes or assess what the overall effect of such potential changes could be on our results of operations or cash flows.

Regulatory changes and economic conditions leading up to and following the United Kingdom’s likely exit from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

•

Following a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") approved an exit from the European Union ("EU"), it is expected that the U.K. government will initiate a process to leave the EU (often referred to as Brexit) and begin negotiating the terms of the U.K.’s future relationship with the EU.

•

Any impact from Brexit on the Company will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade and other negotiations. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the U.K and the EU as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate and the EU determines how to treat regulated activities (e.g., the activities of credit rating agencies) originating in the U.K. Our businesses are subject to increasing regulation of the financial services and commodities industries in Europe. Potential changes in EU regulation and/or additional regulation in the U.K. could cause additional operating obligations and increased costs for our businesses.

•

Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients.

•

Some of our products support the investment processes of our clients, which, in the aggregate, manage trillions of dollars of assets. Use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

Any such claim, even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us, would involve a significant commitment of our management, personnel, financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation. In addition, such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Increased competition could result in a loss of market share or revenue.

•

The markets for credit ratings, financial research, investment and advisory services, market data, index-based products, and commodities price assessments and related news and information about these markets are intensely competitive. Ratings, Market and Commodities Intelligence and Indices compete domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its ratings, data, research and advisory services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation.

•

While our businesses face competition from traditional content and analytics providers, we also face competition from non-traditional providers such as exchanges, asset managers, investment banks and technology-led companies that are adding content and analytics capabilities to their core businesses.

•

In addition, in some of the countries in which Ratings competes, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers.



•

Sustained downward pressure on oil and other commodities prices and trading activity in those markets could have a material adverse effect on the rate of growth of Platts’ revenue, including subscription and licensing fees.

Introduction of new products, services or technologies could impact our profitability.

•

We operate in highly competitive markets that continue to change to adapt to customer needs. In order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new offerings and new ways to deliver our products and services. These investments may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically.

•

We could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment in which we operate.

•

We rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings. We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems.

A significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.

•

Our major expenditures include employee compensation and capital investments.

•

We offer competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses. Compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including those affecting the cost of health insurance and postretirement benefits, and any trends specific to the employee skill sets we require.

•

We make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives and we cannot provide assurances that such investments will result in increased revenues.

•

Although we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans, there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability of these investments.

Increased availability of free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and have a could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

In recent years, more public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become available, particularly through the Internet, and advances in public cloud computing and open source software may continue.

•

Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products and services. Demand could also be reduced as a result of cost-cutting initiatives at certain companies and organizations. Although we believe our products are enhanced by our analysis, tools and applications, our financial results may be adversely affected if our customers choose to use these public sources as a substitute for our products or services.

Consolidation of customers as well as staffing levels across our customer base could impact our available markets and revenue growth.

•

Our businesses have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the corporate, financial services and commodities industries. The consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions across these industries can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size of our customer base.

•

Our customers that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on our products and services. If a large number of smaller customers or a critical number of larger customers reduce their spending with us, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

•

Alternatively, customers may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial and commodity market products and services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors, including by selecting other vendors with lower-cost offerings, or by self-sourcing their need for financial and commodity market products and services. If customers elect to consolidate their spending on financial and commodity market products and services with other vendors and not us, if we lose business to lower priced competitors, or if customers elect to self-source their product and service needs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

•

A material portion of our revenues in our Indices business is concentrated in some of our largest customers, who have significant assets under management in index funds and exchange-traded funds. A loss of a substantial portion of revenue from our largest customers could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.



If we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed, we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire.

•

Our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers, including certain data, software and service suppliers. Some of our products are dependent upon (and of little value without) updates from our data suppliers and most of our information and data products are dependent upon (and of little value without) continuing access to historical and current data.

•

We utilize certain data provided by third-party data sources in a variety of ways, including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world.

•

If the data from our suppliers has errors, is delayed, has design defects, is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

Some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice. Termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from, or restricted use of, or litigation in connection with, a data provider’s information could decrease the available information for us to use (and offer our clients) and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Changes in the legislative, regulatory, and commercial environments in which we operate may materially and adversely impact our ability to collect, compile, use, and publish data and may impact our financial results.

•

Certain types of information we collect, compile, use, and publish, including offerings in our Market and Commodities Intelligence business, are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, there is increasing concern among certain privacy advocates and government regulators regarding marketing and privacy matters, particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests.

•

These concerns may result in new or amended laws and regulations. Future laws and regulations with respect to the collection, compilation, use, and publication of information and consumer privacy could result in limitations on our operations, increased compliance or litigation expense, adverse publicity, or loss of revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. It is also possible that we could be prohibited from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs.

Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position.

•

Our products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of digital and other media. Our ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property against infringement. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets.

•

Our products also contain intellectual property of third party sources.  Any violation by us of the intellectual property rights of such third parties could result in litigation and reputational damage which materially and adversely affects our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations.

•

The geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance and reputational risks. These include, among others, risks relating to:

▪

economic and political conditions around the world,

▪

inflation,

▪

fluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates,

▪

limitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S. subsidiaries,

▪

differing accounting principles and standards,

▪

unexpected increases in taxes or changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws,

▪

the costs of repatriating cash held by entities outside the United States, including withholding or other taxes that foreign governments may impose on the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S. subsidiaries,

▪

potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations (including tax systems) administered by foreign government agencies, some of which may conflict with U.S. or other sources of law,

▪

changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements,

▪

the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions,



▪

competition with local rating agencies that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions,

▪

civil unrest, terrorism, unstable governments and legal systems, and other factors.

Adverse developments in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

Additionally, we are subject to complex U.S., European and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations abroad, including trade sanctions laws, anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, anti-bribery laws, anti-money laundering laws, and other financial crimes laws.  Although we have implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, such measures may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations.  Any determination that we have violated trade sanctions, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.

•

Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our ability to continue to operate will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. In such an event, we could experience operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel, that could have a material adverse effect on our business.

•

We regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.

Outsourcing certain aspects of our business could result in disruption and increased costs.

•

We have outsourced certain support functions to third-party service providers to leverage leading specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies. Outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not perform to our standards or legal requirements, may not produce reliable results, may not perform in a timely manner, may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or may fail to perform at all. Failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could result in material financial loss, higher costs, regulatory actions and reputational harm.

•

Outsourcing these functions also involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of our confidential information and data.  Failure of these third parties to maintain these safeguards could result in unauthorized access to our systems or a system or network disruption that could lead to improper disclosure of confidential information or data, regulatory penalties and remedial costs.

We rely heavily on network systems and the Internet and any failures or disruptions may adversely affect our ability to serve our customers.

•

Many of our products and services are delivered electronically, and our customers rely on our ability to process transactions rapidly and deliver substantial quantities of data on computer-based networks. Our customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems, our websites and the Internet.

•

Our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party Internet providers or increased government regulation.

•

Delays in our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers. In addition, a number of our customers entrust us with storing and securing their data and information on our servers.



•

Although we have disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities for our primary data centers, our systems are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective. As such, these disruptions may affect our ability to store, handle and secure such data and information.

Our operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

•

Our ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located, including New York City, the location of our headquarters, and major cities worldwide in which we have offices.

•

This may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure used by us or third parties with or through whom we conduct business, whether due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, war or otherwise. Our efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of our major operating systems may not be successful.

•

We also do not have fully redundant systems for most of our smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of our locations or systems and our personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons’ ability to service and interact with our clients and customers may suffer.

•

We cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to our operations or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information.

•

Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of data and information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors.

•

All of our businesses have access to material non-public information concerning the Company’s customers, including sovereigns, corporate issuers and other third parties around the world, the unauthorized disclosure of which could affect the trading markets for such customers’ securities and could damage such customers’ competitive positions. The cyber risks the Company faces range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to more sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to certain information or systems due in part to our prominence in the global marketplace, such as our ratings on debt issued by sovereigns and corporate issuers, or the composition of our indices. Unauthorized disclosure of this information could cause our customers to lose faith in our ability to protect their confidential information and therefore cause customers to cease doing business with us.

•

Breaches of our or our vendors’ systems and networks, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, computer viruses or malware, employee error, malfeasance, physical breaches or other actions, may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such vendors’ websites, applications or data processing, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding us, our business or our customers.

•

Misappropriation, improper modification, destruction, corruption or unavailability of our data and information due to cyber incidents, attacks or other security breaches could damage our brand and reputation, result in litigation and regulatory actions, and lead to loss of customer confidence in our security measures and reliability, which would harm our ability to retain customers and gain new ones.

•

Although S&P Global and its affiliates devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update their systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the enterprise and our customers, clients and employees, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security.

•

Measures that we take to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or become obsolete. Any material incidents could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us, and increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents.

•

Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these



techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources.

•

If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could result in damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services.

•

The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, if despite our best efforts an inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations should occur, this could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.

•

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Inability to attract and retain key qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

•

The development, maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge, experience and ability of our highly skilled, educated and trained employees.  Accordingly, our business is dependent on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. If the Company is less successful in its recruiting efforts, or if it is unable to retain key employees, its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services or achieve strategic goals may be adversely affected.

Hiver2016!

Our brand and reputation are key assets and competitive advantages of our Company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.

•

Our ability to attract and retain customers is affected by external perceptions of our brand and reputation. Negative perceptions or publicity could damage our reputation with customers, prospects and the public generally, which could negatively impact, among other things, our ability to attract and retain customers, employees and suppliers, as well as suitable candidates for acquisition or other combinations.

Repurchase of Equity Securities

On December 4, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to

50 million

shares, which was approximately

18%

of the Company's outstanding shares at that time. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we received an additional

0.9 million

shares from the conclusion of our accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement that we entered into on September 7, 2016. Further discussion relating to our ASR agreement can be found in Note 9 -

Equity

. As of

December 31, 2016

,

25.8 million

shares remained under our current repurchase program.

Repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. Our current repurchase program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions.

and


, respectively. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

•

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information

•

Critical Accounting Estimates

•

Recent Accounting Standards

Certain of the statements below are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Forward-Looking Statements on page 4 of this report.

OVERVIEW

We are a leading  provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, and issuers; and the commodity markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, petrochemicals and agriculture.

On April 27, 2016, we changed our name to S&P Global Inc. from McGraw Hill Financial, Inc.

We have repositioned S&P Global as a more focused company in the capital and commodity markets by exiting non-core assets and investing for growth in markets that have size and scale. In 2016, we continued to create a portfolio focused on scalable, industry leading, interrelated businesses in the capital and commodity markets.

Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Ratings, Market and Commodities Intelligence and S&P Dow Jones Indices ("Indices").

•

Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks.

•

Market and Commodities Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data, research and analytical capabilities, which integrate cross-asset analytics and desktop services and deliver their customers in the commodity and energy markets access to high-value information, data, analytic services and pricing and quality benchmarks. As of September 7, 2016, we completed the sale of J.D. Power and the results are included in Market and Commodities Intelligence results through that date.

•

Indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors.

Effective beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of these segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts are included in a new reportable segment named Market and Commodities Intelligence. Our historical segment reporting has been retroactively revised to reflect the current organizational structure.

Major Portfolio Changes

The following significant changes by segment were made to our portfolio during the three years ended December 31, 2016:




Market and Commodities Intelligence

•

In October of 2016, we completed the sale of Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc. ("SPSE") and Credit Market Analysis ("CMA") for $425 million in cash to Intercontinental Exchange, an operator of global exchanges, clearing houses and data services.  During year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $364 million ($297 million after-tax) in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of SPSE and CMA.

•

In September of 2016, we completed the sale of J.D. Power for $1.1 billion to XIO Group, a global alternative investments firm headquartered in London. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we began exploring strategic alternatives for J.D. Power and initiated an active program to sell the business. The assets and liabilities of J.D.

Market and Commodities Intelligence

•

In September of 2015, we acquired SNL Financial LC ("SNL") for $2.2 billion. SNL is a global provider of news, data, and analytical tools to five sectors in the global economy: financial services, real estate, energy, media & communications, and metals & mining. SNL delivers information through its suite of web, mobile and direct data feed platforms that helps clients, including investment and commercial banks, investors, corporations, and regulators make decisions, improve efficiency, and manage risk.

Increased Shareholder Return

During the three years ended

December 31, 2016

, we have returned approximately

$3.5 billion

to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and our quarterly dividends: we completed share repurchases of approximately

$2.4 billion

and distributed regular quarterly dividends totaling approximately

$1.1 billion

. Also, on

January 25, 2017

, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.36 per share to $0.41 per share.

Key Results

N/M - not meaningful


% changes in the tables throughout the MD&A are calculated off of the actual number, not the rounded number presented.


2016 includes a $1.1 billion gain from our dispositions, a benefit related to net legal settlement insurance recoveries of $10 million,  disposition-related costs of $48 million, a technology-related impairment charge of $24 million, restructuring charges of $6 million, a $3 million disposition-related reserve release and acquisition-related costs of $1 million. 2015 includes costs related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of $56 million, net legal settlement expenses of $54 million, acquisition-related costs of $37 million and a gain of $11 million on the sale of our interest in a legacy McGraw Hill Construction investment. 2014 includes $1.6 billion of legal and regulatory settlements, restructuring charges of $86 million and $4 million of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities. 2016, 2015 and 2014 also includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $96 million, $67 million and $48 million, respectively.


Revenue increased

7%

driven by increases at all of our reportable segments. Revenue growth at Market and Commodities Intelligence was favorably impacted by the acquisition of SNL in September of 2015 and annualized contract value growth primarily driven by the S&P Capital IQ Desktop, Global Risk Services and certain data feed products. Continued demand for S&P Global Platts’ proprietary content also contributed to revenue growth. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from our dispositions in 2016. Revenue growth at Ratings was driven by an increase in U.S. bank loan ratings revenue, corporate bond ratings revenue and surveillance fees. Revenue growth at Indices was due to higher average levels of assets under management for exchange traded funds ("ETFs") and mutual funds, an increase in data revenue and higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point.

Operating profit increased

76%

. Excluding the favorable impact of the gain from our dispositions of 59 percentage points, higher net legal settlement insurance recoveries in 2016 of 3 percentage points, higher restructuring charges in 2015 of 3 percentage points and higher acquisition-related costs in 2015 of 2 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of higher disposition-related costs of 3 percentage points, higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 2 percentage points and a technology-related impairment charge of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 15%. This increase was primarily driven by revenue growth as discussed above. Decreased costs at Ratings and our legacy Capital IQ business due to reduced headcount following our 2015 restructuring actions also contributed to operating profit growth.


Revenue increased

5%

driven by increases at Market and Commodities Intelligence and Indices, partially offset by a decrease at Ratings. Revenue growth at Market and Commodities Intelligence was favorably impacted by the acquisition of SNL in September of 2015 and the acquisition of National Automobile Dealers Association's Used Car Guide (“UCG”) at J.D. Power in July of 2015. The revenue increase at Market and Commodities Intelligence was also driven by increases in average contract values in the S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Global Risk Services products, continued demand for S&P Global Platts' proprietary content and an increase in auto consulting engagements in the U.S. at J.D. Power. Revenue growth at Indices was due to higher average levels of assets under management for ETFs and mutual funds and higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives. The revenue decrease at Ratings was driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 2 percentage points which was offset by the favorable impact from acquisitions of 2 percentage points.



The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the impact of $1.6 billion in legal and regulatory settlements in 2014 compared

to net legal settlement expenses of $54 million in 2015. In addition, 2015 includes costs related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of $56 million in 2015 compared to $86 million in 2014. 2015 also includes acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of SNL of $37 million and an $11 million gain on the sale of our interest in a legacy McGraw Hill Construction investment. 2014 includes $4 million of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities. Excluding these items, operating profit increased 13%. This increase was driven by revenue growth at Market and Commodities Intelligence and Indices and cost containment efforts at Ratings during 2015.

Outlook

We are a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. Our purpose is to provide the intelligence that is essential for companies, governments and individuals to make decisions with conviction. We seek to deliver on this purpose within the framework of our core values of integrity, excellence and relevance.

With the successful completion of our Growth and Performance Plan, we are aligning our efforts against two key strategic priorities, growth and excellence. We strive to deliver on our strategic priorities in the following four categories by:

Financial

•

Delivering strong financial performance and long-term value to our shareholders.

Growth

•

Engaging with the world around us;

•

Investing to meet customer needs in high growth areas; and

•

Expanding in international markets.

Excellence

•

Embracing operational excellence in all that we do; and

•

Accelerating digital transformation and stimulating innovation.

Talent

•

Enhancing leadership and accountability.

There can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies as a variety of factors could unfavorably impact operating results, including prolonged difficulties in the global credit markets and a change in the regulatory environment affecting our businesses. See Item 1a,

Risk Factors

, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Further projections and discussion on our


outlook for our segments can be found within “ – Results of Operations”.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Review

N/M - not meaningful

Revenue




Revenue increased

7%

as compared to


. Subscription / non-transaction revenue increased primarily from the favorable impact of  the acquisition of SNL in September of 2015, growth in average contract values for our legacy Capital IQ products driven by an expansion in new and existing accounts, continued demand for S&P Global Platts’ proprietary content and an increase in surveillance fees at Ratings. Asset linked fees increased due to higher average levels of assets under management for ETFs and mutual funds. Non-subscription / transaction revenue decreased primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the sale of J.D. Power on September 7, 2016, partially offset by an increase in U.S. bank loan ratings revenue and corporate bond ratings revenue at Ratings and higher volumes for exchange traded derivatives at Indices. See " – Segment Review" below for further information.

The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year.

. Subscription / non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth at Market and Commodities Intelligence due to an increase in the average contract values in the S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Global Risk Services products as well as continued demand for S&P Global Platts’ proprietary content. Assets linked fees increased due to higher average levels of assets under management for ETFs and mutual funds. Non-subscription / transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth at Indices due to higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives, partially offset by a decrease at Ratings which includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Subscription / non-transaction revenue growth was also favorably impacted by the acquisitions of SNL and UCG in September of 2015 and July of 2015, respectively. See " – Segment Review" below for further information.

The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 2 percentage points. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue primarily related to Ratings and was driven by the weakening of the Euro to the U.S. dollar.

Operating-Related Expenses

Operating-related expenses increased

$69 million

or

4%

as compared to


. The increase at Market and Commodities  Intelligence was primarily driven by the acquisition of SNL in September of 2015, partially offset by decreases from our dispositions in 2016. Increases at Ratings and Indices were due to higher compensation costs related to additional headcount and increased incentive costs.

Selling and General Expenses

Selling and general expenses decreased

7%

. Excluding the favorable impact of higher net legal settlement insurance recoveries in 2016 of 4 percentage points, higher restructuring charges in 2015 of 3 percentage points, higher acquisition-related costs in 2015 of 2 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of disposition-related costs of 3 percentage points and a technology-related impairment charge of 1 percentage point, selling and general expenses decreased 2%. Decreases at Ratings were driven by reduced professional fees following the completion of the Company's program for the 2015 implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and reduced legal fees following the resolution of a number of significant legal matters. This decrease was partially offset by an increase at Market and Commodities Intelligence driven by the acquisition of SNL in September of 2015, partially offset by decreases from our dispositions in 2016.

Selling and General Expenses

Selling and general expenses decreased

51%

. Excluding the favorable net impact of legal settlement and regulatory settlement charges and insurance recoveries of 48 percentage points, higher costs recorded in 2014 related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of 1 percentage point, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of SNL of 1 percentage point, selling and general expenses decreased 3%. The decline was due to a decrease at Ratings driven by lower incentive and legal costs, partially offset by increased costs related to the 2015 implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and an increase at Market and Commodities Intelligence driven by the acquisition of SNL in September of 2015.

Depreciation and Amortization

During 2016, we completed the following transactions that resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1.1 billion in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income:

•

In October of 2016, we completed the sale of Equity and Fund Research ("Equity Research"), a business within our Market and Commodities Intelligence segment to CFRA, a leading independent provider of forensic accounting research, analytics and advisory services. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $9 million in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of Equity Research.

•

In September of 2016, we completed the sale of J.D. Power for $1.1 billion to XIO Group, a global alternative investments firm headquartered in London. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $728 million in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of J.D. Power.

During 2015, we completed the sale of our interest in a legacy McGraw Hill Construction investment that resulted in a pre-tax gain of $11 million in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income.

During 2014, we completed the following transactions that resulted in a pre-tax loss of $9 million in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income:

•

On July 31, 2014, we completed the sale of the Company's aircraft to Harold W. McGraw III, then Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and former President and CEO of the Company ("Mr. McGraw") for a purchase price of $20 million, which was modestly higher than the independent appraisal obtained. During the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $6 million in (gain) loss on dispositions in our consolidated statement of income as a result of the pending sale. See Note 14 –

Related Party Transactions

to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

•

On June 30, 2014, we completed the sale of our data center to Quality Technology Services, LLC (“QTS”) which owns, operates, and manages data centers. Net proceeds from the sale of $58 million were received in July of 2014. The sale includes all of the facilities and equipment on the south campus of our East Windsor, New Jersey location, inclusive of the rights and obligations associated with an adjoining solar power field. The sale resulted in an expense of $3 million recorded in (gain) loss on dispositions in our consolidated statement of income, which is in addition to the non-cash impairment charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Operating Profit

We consider operating profit to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and we evaluate operating profit for each of the reportable business segments in which we operate.

We internally manage our operations by reference to “segment operating profit” with economic resources allocated primarily based on segment operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit before unallocated expense. Segment operating profit is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate operating performance. Segment operating profit is not, however, a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.

Effective beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of these segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts are included in a new reportable segment named Market and Commodities Intelligence. Our historical segment reporting has been retroactively revised to reflect the current organizational structure.



The table below reconciles segment operating profit to total operating profit:

N/M - not meaningful



includes a benefit related to net legal settlement insurance recoveries of $10 million and restructuring charges of $6 million. 2015 includes net legal settlement expenses of $54 million and restructuring charges of $13 million. 2014 includes $1.6 billion of legal and regulatory settlements and restructuring charges of $45 million. 2016, 2015 and 2014 also includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $5 million, $5 million and $6 million, respectively.


2016 includes a $1.1 billion gain from our dispositions, disposition-related costs of $48 million, a technology-related impairment charge of $24 million and an acquisition-related cost of $1 million. 2015 includes acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of SNL of $37 million and costs identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of $33 million. 2014 includes $25 million of restructuring charges. 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $85 million, $57 million and $37 million, respectively.


2014 includes the impact of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities of $4 million. 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $6 million, $5 million and $5 million, respectively.


2016 includes $3 million from a disposition-related reserve release. 2015 includes a gain of $11 million related to the sale of our interest in a legacy McGraw Hill Construction investment and costs related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of $10 million. 2014 includes restructuring charges of $16 million.


Segment Operating Profit —

Increased

$1.4 billion

, or

70%

as compared to


. Excluding the favorable impact of the gain from our dispositions of 55 percentage points, higher net legal settlement insurance recoveries in 2016 of 3 percentage points, higher acquisition-related costs in 2015 of 2 percentage points, higher restructuring charges in 2015 of 2 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a technology-related impairment charge of 1 percentage point, higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 2 percentage points and higher disposition-related costs of 2 percentage points, segment operating profit increased 13%. Revenue growth at Market and Commodities Intelligence, Ratings and Indices were the primary drivers for the increase. Decreased costs at Ratings and our legacy Capital IQ business  due to reduced headcount following our 2015 restructuring actions also contributed to segment operating profit growth. See “ – Segment Review” below for further information.

Unallocated Expense

—

Decreased by

$11 million

or

8%

as compared to


. These expenses, included in selling and general expenses, mainly include costs for corporate center functions, select initiatives and unoccupied office space. Excluding the unfavorable impact of a gain on the sale of our interest in a legacy McGraw Hill Construction investment in 2015 of 8 percentage points, partially offset by the favorable impact of a disposition-related reserve release of 2 percentage points and higher restructuring charges in 2015 of 7 percentage points, unallocated expense decreased 7% due to higher 2016 pension income as well as a reduction in professional service fees.

Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of 2 percentage points. The foreign exchange rate impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Constant currency impacts are estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual business' functional currency.


Segment Operating Profit —

Increased

$1.8 billion

, or

629%

as compared to 2014. 2015 includes net legal settlement charges of $54 million compared to legal and regulatory settlement charges of $1.6 billion in 2014. Excluding the favorable impact of lower net legal and regulatory settlement charges of 621 percentage points, higher costs recorded in 2014 related to identified operating



efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of 9 percentage points and the impact of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities recorded in 2014 of 2 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of SNL of 15 percentage points, segment operating profit increased 11%. Revenue growth at Market and Commodities Intelligence and Indices, and cost containment efforts at Ratings during 2015 were the primary drivers for the increase. See “ – Segment Review” below for further information.

Unallocated Expense

—

Decreased by

$31 million

or

18%

as compared to 2014. These expenses, included in selling and general expenses, mainly include costs for corporate center functions, select initiatives and unoccupied office space. Excluding the favorable impact of the sale of our interest in a legacy McGraw Hill Construction investment of 6 percentage points and higher costs recorded in 2014 related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of 4 percentage points, unallocated expense decreased by 9 percentage points as compared to 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by the impact of a $9 million loss recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to the sale of the Company's aircraft and the sale of our data center.

Foreign currency exchange rates had a negligible impact on operating profit. The foreign exchange rate impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Constant currency impacts are estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual business' functional currency.

Interest Expense, net

Net interest expense for


increased

$79 million

or

77%

as compared to


, primarily as a result of the $700 million of senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2015, the $2.0 billion of senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2015 and the $500 million of senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2016. Additionally, net interest expense in 2016 includes a redemption fee on the early payment of our 5.9% senior notes due in 2017. These increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of lower interest rates on the $500 million of senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2016.

Net interest expense for


increased

73%

compared to


as a result of the $700 million of senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2015 and the $2.0 billion of senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2015.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was

30.1%

for


and


, and

453.7%

for


. The decrease in the 2015 effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in charges for legal settlements, improved profitability in several lower tax jurisdictions outside of the United States, and continuing resolution of prior year tax audits.

Discontinued Operations, net

Income from discontinued operations was

$178 million

in 2014, primarily as a result of the  after-tax gain of

$160 million

recorded on the sale of McGraw Hill Construction in 2014.

Segment Review

Ratings

Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics to investors, issuers and other market participants. Credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default.

Ratings differentiates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:

•

ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, and structured finance debt instruments;

•

bank loan ratings; and



•

corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of a company which does not currently have a Ratings credit rating.

Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment royalty charged to Market and Commodities Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings. Royalty revenue for


, 2015 and 2014 was

$92 million

,

$83 million

and $77 million, respectively.

N/M - not meaningful



includes a benefit related to net legal settlement insurance recoveries of $10 million and restructuring charges of $6 million. 2015 includes net legal settlement expenses of $54 million and restructuring charges of $13 million. 2014 includes $1.6 billion of legal and regulatory settlements and restructuring charges of $45 million. 2016, 2015 and 2014 also includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $5 million, $5 million and $6 million, respectively.


Revenue increased

4%

, which includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates that reduced revenue by 1 percentage point. Transaction revenue increased due to growth in U.S. bank loan ratings revenue and an increase in corporate bond ratings revenue largely driven by refinancing activity from the low interest rate environment, partially offset by a decrease in structured finance revenue. Revenue growth benefited from increased contract realization. Non-transaction revenue grew primarily due to an increase in surveillance fees, partially offset by a decline in Ratings Evaluation Service ("RES") activity.

Operating profit increased

17%

. Excluding the favorable impact of higher net legal settlement insurance recoveries in 2016 of 6 percentage points and lower restructuring charges in 2016 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 10%. The increase is due to both revenue growth and expense reduction. Reduced expenses were primarily driven by reduced professional fees following the completion of the Company's program for the 2015 implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and reduced legal fees following the resolution of a number of significant legal matters. These decreases were partially offset by higher compensation costs related to increased incentive costs and additional headcount. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of 1 percentage point.


Revenue decreased 1%, which includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates that reduced revenue by 4 percentage points. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in U.S. Public Finance issuance, partially offset by a decline in structured finance revenue driven by reduced global market issuance.



Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, non-transaction revenue also increased due to growth in surveillance revenues and additional RES activity, partially offset by lower revenue associated with new client relationships.

Operating profit increased 285%. Excluding the favorable net impact of legal and regulatory settlement charges and insurance recoveries of 273 percentage points and net higher restructuring costs recorded in 2014 of 6 percentage points, operating profit increased 7%. Foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the operating profit growth of 7%. This increase was driven by decreased compensation costs primarily driven by lower incentive costs and cost containment resulting from 2014 restructuring actions and reduced legal fees following the resolution of a number of significant legal matters, partially offset by increased costs related to the 2015 implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the decrease in revenue discussed above.

Market Issuance Volumes

We monitor market issuance volumes as an indicator of trends in transaction revenue streams within Ratings. Market issuance volumes noted within the discussion that follows are based on the domicile of the issuer. Issuance volumes can be reported in two ways: by "domicile", which is based on where an issuer is located or where the assets associated with an issue are located, or based on "marketplace", which is where the bonds are sold. The following tables depict changes in market issuance levels as compared to the prior year, based on a composite of Thomson Financial, Harrison Scott Publications, Dealogic and Rating’s internal estimates.

•

Decreases in high-yield issuance in the year-to-date period reflect weakness in the first half of the year due to market volatility and political and economic uncertainty in the European markets. High-yield issuance in the U.S. and Europe was up for the second half of the year as a result of more favorable market conditions primarily due to tightening credit spreads. Although the number of investment-grade issuances in the U.S. was up, issuance dollars declined due to fewer high par value issuance deals.

*

Represents no activity in 2016 and 2015.

•

ABS issuance was up in the U.S. and Europe driven by an increase in credit card transactions, consumer loans and small business loans.

•

Issuance was down in the U.S. Structured Credit markets driven by lower availability of leveraged loans. Issuance was up in the European Structured Credit markets driven by new collateralized loan obligations ("CLO") engagements.

•

CMBS issuance in the U.S. and Europe was down reflecting lower market volume due to overall market conditions.

•

RMBS volume in the U.S. was down driven by minimal activity in the private label securities market. The increase in  European RMBS volume was driven by several large issuances in 2016.

•

Covered bond (debt securities backed by mortgages or other high-quality assets that remain on the issuer's balance sheet) issuance in Europe was down due to the impact of central bank lending policies.



Industry Highlights and Outlook

Revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to an increase in U.S. bank loan ratings and corporate bond ratings revenue driven by refinancing activity from the low interest rate environment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in structured finance revenue. High-yield corporate issuance volumes increased in the second half of the year as a result of more favorable market conditions primarily due to tightening credit spreads. Weakness in high-yield corporate issuance volumes in the first half of the year was due to market volatility and political and economic uncertainty largely in the European markets.

Legal and Regulatory Environment

General

Ratings and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the U.S. and in other countries, and therefore existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the Company’s operations and the markets in which it operates. Additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered. In addition, in certain countries, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies. For example, governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers. We have reviewed the new laws, regulations and rules which have been adopted and we have implemented, or are planning to implement, changes as required. We do not believe that such new laws, regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies. The impact on us of the adoption of any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain, but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to Ratings’ rating activities, or adversely affect our ability to compete, or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings.

In the normal course of business both in the U.S. and abroad, Ratings (or the legal entities comprising Ratings) are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries. Many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of Ratings and are or have been brought by purchasers of rated securities. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into Ratings’ compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.

U.S.

The businesses conducted by our Ratings segment are, in certain cases, regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the “Reform Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd Frank Act”), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business. The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the U.S.

S&P Global Ratings is a credit rating agency that is registered with the SEC as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). The SEC first began informally designating NRSROs in 1975 for use of their credit ratings in the determination of capital charges for registered brokers and dealers under the SEC’s Net Capital Rule. The Reform Act created a new SEC registration system for rating agencies that choose to register as NRSROs. Under the Reform Act, the SEC is given authority and oversight of NRSROs and can censure NRSROs, revoke their registration or limit or suspend their registration in certain cases. The rules implemented by the SEC pursuant to the Reform Act, the Dodd Frank Act and the Exchange Act address, among other things, prevention or misuse of material non-public information, conflicts of interest, documentation and assessment of internal controls, and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies. The public portions of the current version of S&P Global Ratings’ Form NRSRO are available on S&P Global Ratings’ website.

European Union

In the European Union, the credit rating industry is registered and supervised through a pan-European regulatory framework which is a compilation of three sets of legislative actions. In 2009, the European Parliament passed a regulation (“CRA1”) that established an oversight regime for the credit rating industry in the European Union, which became effective in 2010. CRA1 requires the registration, formal regulation and periodic inspection of credit rating agencies operating in the European Union. Ratings was granted registration in October of 2011. In January of 2011, the European Union established the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”), which, among other things, has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered credit rating industry throughout the European Union.



Additional rules augmenting the supervisory framework for credit rating agencies went into effect in 2013. Commonly referred to as CRA3, these rules, among other things:

•

impose various additional procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers;

•

require member states to adopt laws imposing liability on credit rating agencies for an intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by the applicable regulations;

•

impose mandatory rotation requirements on credit rating agencies hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations, which may limit the number of years a credit rating agency can issue ratings for such securities of a particular issuer;

•

impose restrictions on credit rating agencies or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed; and

•

impose additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services.

The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the European Union.

Other Jurisdictions

Outside of the U.S. and the European Union, regulators and government officials have also been implementing formal oversight of credit rating agencies. Ratings is subject to regulations in most of the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and continues to work closely with regulators globally to promote the global consistency of regulatory requirements. Regulators in additional countries may introduce new regulations in the future.

For a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Ratings business, see Item 1a, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory environment in our Ratings business, see Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Market and Commodities Intelligence

Market and Commodities Intelligence's portfolio of capabilities are designed to help the financial community track performance, generate better investment returns, identify new trading and investment ideas, perform risk analysis, develop mitigation strategies and provide high-value information to the commodity and energy markets that enable its customers to make better informed trading and business decisions.

Effective beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of these segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts are included in a new reportable segment named Market and Commodities Intelligence. Our historical segment reporting has been retroactively revised to reflect the current organizational structure.

In November of 2016, we entered into a put option agreement that gave the Company the right, but not the obligation, to put the entire share capital of Quant House SAS ("QuantHouse"), included in our Market and Commodities Intelligence segment, to QH Holdco, an independent third party. As a result, we classified the assets and liabilities of QuantHouse, net of our costs to sell, as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 resulting in an aggregate loss of

$31 million

. On January 4, 2017, we exercised the put option, thereby entering into a definitive agreement to sell QuantHouse to QH Holdco. On January 9, 2017, we completed the sale of QuantHouse to QH Holdco.

In October of 2016, we completed the sale of Equity Research, a business within our Market and Commodities Intelligence segment to CFRA, a leading independent provider of forensic accounting research, analytics and advisory services. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $9 million ($5 million after-tax) in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of Equity Research.

In October of 2016, we completed the sale of SPSE and CMA for $425 million in cash to Intercontinental Exchange, an operator of global exchanges, clearing houses and data services.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $364 million ($297 million after-tax) in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of SPSE and CMA.

In September of 2016, we completed the sale of J.D. Power for $1.1 billion to XIO Group, a global alternative investments firm headquartered in London. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we began exploring strategic alternatives for J.D. Power and initiated an active program to sell the business. The assets and liabilities of J.D. Power were classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $728 million ($516 million after-tax) in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of J.D. Power.



Following the sale, the assets and liabilities of J.D. Power are no longer reported in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.

On November 3, 2014, we completed the sale of McGraw Hill Construction to Symphony Technology Group for $320 million in cash. Accordingly, the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 and all prior periods presented were reclassified to reflect the business as a discontinued operation. See Note 2 —

As of September 7, 2016, we completed the sale of J.D. Power and the results are included in Market and Commodities Intelligence results through that date.

N/M - not meaningful


2016 includes a $1.1 billion gain from our dispositions, disposition-related costs of $48 million, a technology-related impairment charge of $24 million and an acquisition-related cost of $1 million. 2015 includes acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of SNL of $37 million and costs identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of $33 million. 2014 includes $25 million of restructuring charges. 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $85 million, $57 million and $37 million, respectively.




Revenue increased

9%

and was favorably impacted by 1 percentage point of growth from the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions discussed below. Revenue growth was also driven by increases in annualized contract values in the S&P Capital IQ Desktop, RatingsXpress® and RatingsDirect® from new and existing customers. The number of users on the S&P Capital IQ Desktop and the number of customers at RatingsXpress® continued to grow in 2016. Increases in annualized contract value for certain of our data feed products also contributed to revenue growth. Additionally, strength in S&P Global Platts' proprietary content due to continued demand for S&P Global Platts’ market data and price assessment products across all commodity sectors, led by petroleum, and continued licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to various commodity exchanges contributed to revenue growth. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point. Both domestic and international revenue increased, with international revenue representing 41% of Market and Commodities Intelligence's total revenue. Revenue was favorably impacted by the acquisitions of SNL, PIRA Energy Group ("PIRA"), RigData and Petromedia Ltd, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the dispositions of J.D. Power, SPSE and CMA and Equity Research. See Note 2 —

Acquisitions and Divestitures

for further discussion.

Operating profit increased 212%. Excluding the favorable impact from the gain on dispositions of 194 percentage points, the favorable impact of higher acquisition-related costs in 2015 of 6 percentage points and higher restructuring charges in 2015 of 6 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of higher disposition-related costs of 9 percentage points, higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 5 percentage points and a technology-related impairment charge of 4 percentage points, operating profit increased 24%. This increase is due to revenue growth and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 5 percentage points, partially offset by higher compensation costs and increased technology costs primarily as a result of the acquisition of SNL in September of 2015.


Revenue increased 12% and was favorably impacted by 5 percentage points of growth from the impact of acquisitions discussed below. Revenue growth was also driven by  increases in annualized contract values in the S&P Capital IQ Desktop, RatingsXpress® and RatingsDirect® from new and existing customers. The number of users on the S&P Capital IQ Desktop and the number of customers at RatingsXpress® continued to grow in 2015. Additionally, strength in S&P Global Platts' proprietary content due to continued demand for S&P Global Platts’ market data and price assessment products across all commodity sectors, led by petroleum product offerings, and continued licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to various commodity exchanges contributed to revenue growth. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point. Revenue was favorably impacted by the acquisitions of SNL, National Automobile Dealers Association's Used Car Guide ("UCG"), Petromedia in July of 2015 and Eclipse Energy Group AS and its operating subsidiaries (“Eclipse”). See Note 2 —

Acquisitions and Divestitures

for further discussion.

Operating profit increased 13%. Excluding the unfavorable impact of acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of SNL of 6 percentage points, higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 3 percentage points and higher costs recorded in 2015 related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 23%. This increase is due to revenue growth and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 5 percentage points, partially offset by higher technology costs and increased compensation costs driven by additional headcount related to the acquisitions of SNL and UCG.

Industry Highlights and Outlook

In 2016, Market and Commodities Intelligence benefited from organic revenue growth and continued revenue and costs synergies resulting from progress on the integration of S

NL. In 2016, the segment completed the sale of J.D. Power, and SPSE and CMA, resulting in a portfolio focused on scalable, industry leading, interrelated businesses in the capital and commodity markets. Additionally, in 2016, the segment completed the acquisitions of PIRA and RigData to enhance Market and Commodities Intelligence's energy analytical capabilities.

In 2017, Market and Commodities Intelligence will seek to develop new products and deliver enhancements to existing content and analytical capabilities. The segment also expects to further expand its presence in selected markets and geographies to accelerate international growth. Market and Commodities Intelligence will continue to focus on integrating and leveraging recent acquisitions to expand its analytical offerings.



Legal and Regulatory Environment

Market Intelligence

The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the U.S. and abroad. Market Intelligence operates investment advisory businesses that are regulated in the U.S. under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Investment Advisers Act”) and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.

Market Intelligence operates a business that is authorized and regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”). As such, this business is authorized to arrange and advise on investments, and is also entitled to exercise a passport right to provide specified cross border services into other European Economic Area (“EEA”) States, and is to the conditions under the E.U. Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”).

On October 4, 2016, S&P Global completed the sale of Standard & Poor’s Securities Evaluations, Inc. (one of Market Intelligence’s investment advisory businesses) to Intercontinental Exchange.  On October 3, 2016 Market Intelligence completed the sale of substantially all of its Equity Research business by transferring the assets of the business to Accounting Research & Analytics, LLC (“CFRA”).  On September 7, 2016 Market Intelligence entered into a stock purchase agreement  with CFRA  to sell  and transfer  its entire  ownership in  Standard & Poor’s Malaysia Sdn. Bhd (S&P Malaysia) and its  research business.  Until the completion of this transaction, Market Intelligence will continue to operate the Equity Research business conducted by S&P Malaysia.

The markets for research and investment advisory services are very competitive. Market Intelligence competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its research and advisory services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and services, and technological innovation. For a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Market Intelligence business, see Item 1a, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

S&P Global Platts

S&P Global Platts’ commodities price assessment and information business is subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and abroad.  As discussed below under the heading “Indices-Legal and Regulatory Environment”, the financial benchmarks industry is subject to the new pending benchmark regulation in the European Union (the “E.U. Benchmark Regulation”) as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions.  As a result of these measures, as well as measures that could be taken in other jurisdictions outside of Europe, S&P Global Platts will be required in due course to obtain registration or authorization in connection with its benchmark and price assessment activities in Europe and potentially elsewhere.

Also as discussed above under the heading “Indices-Legal and Regulatory Environment”, the European Union has recently finalized a package of legislative measures known as MiFID II, which may also impact S&P Global Platts’ business.  Although the MiFID II package is “framework” legislation, it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect S&P Global Platts’ ability both to administer and license its price assessments.

In October of 2012, IOSCO issued its PRA Principles which set out principles, which are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members. S&P Global Platts has taken steps to align its operations with the PRA Principles and as recommended by IOSCO in its final report on the PRA Principles, has aligned to the PRA Principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks.

The markets for commodities price assessments and information are very competitive. S&P Global Platts competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its assessments and other information it provides to the commodities and related markets, client service, reputation, price, range of products and services (including geographic coverage) and technological innovation. Furthermore, sustained downward pressure on oil and other commodities prices and trading activity in those markets could have a material adverse impact on the rate of growth of S&P Global Platts’ revenue.  For a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Platts business, see Item 1a, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Indices

Indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of indices to meet an array of investor needs. Indices’ mission is to provide transparent benchmarks to help with decision making, collaborate with the financial community to create innovative products and provide investors with tools to monitor world markets.

Indices  primarily derives revenue from asset linked fees based on the S&P and Dow Jones indices and to a lesser extent generates subscription revenue and transaction revenue. Specifically, Indices generates revenue from the following sources:

•

Investment vehicles

—

asset linked fees such as ETFs and mutual funds, that are based on the S&P Dow Jones Indices' benchmarks and generate revenue through fees based on assets and underlying funds;

•

Exchange traded derivatives

—

generate royalties based on trading volumes of derivatives contracts listed on various exchanges;

•

Index-related licensing fees

—

fixed or variable annual and per-issue fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products; and

•

Data and customized index subscription fees

—

fees from supporting index fund management, portfolio analytics and research.


2014 includes $4 million of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities. 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $6 million, $5 million and $5 million, respectively.




Revenue at Indices increased

7%

, primarily driven by higher average levels of assets under management ("AUM") for ETFs and mutual funds, an increase in data revenue and higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives. Revenue growth was favorably impacted by less than one percentage point from the acquisition of Trucost plc ("Trucost") in October of 2016. See Note 2 —

Acquisitions and Divestitures

for further discussion. Ending AUM for ETFs increased 25% to $1.023 trillion and average AUM for ETFs increased 8% to $869 billion compared to 2015. Higher average levels of AUM for ETFs contributed to revenue growth primarily driven by the flow of investment funds to the U.S. equity markets in the second half of the year. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on revenue of less than 1 percentage point.

Operating profit grew

5%

. Revenue growth was partially offset by higher compensation costs primarily driven by additional headcount related to the acquisition of Trucost plc, increased incentive costs and increased operating costs to support revenue growth and business initiatives at Indices. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of less than 1 percentage point.


Revenue at Indices increased 8%, primarily driven by higher average levels of AUM for ETFs and mutual funds. Volumes for exchange-traded derivatives continued to increase for certain products which also contributed to revenue growth. Additionally, the year-over-year revenue increase was slightly unfavorably impacted by the refinement of our process for estimating revenue for certain products that favorably impacted 2014 which caused a one-time revenue increase in the prior-year period. Ending AUM for ETFs decreased 2% to $815 billion in 2015 from $832 billion in 2014, primarily due to the flow of investment funds to the developed international equity markets and the impact of lower equity prices. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 1 percentage point.

Operating profit grew 13%. Excluding the favorable impact of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities recorded in 2014 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 12%. This increase was primarily due to revenue growth as expenses remained relatively flat as a result of cost containment measures.

Industry Highlights and Outlook

Indices continues to be the leading index provider for the ETF market space. In 2016, higher average levels of AUM for ETFs contributed to revenue growth. Additionally, data revenue and higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives contributed to the increase in revenue.

In October of 2016, the segment completed the acquisition of Trucost to build on it's current portfolio of Environmental, Social and Governance solutions.

Indices will continue to seek to expand index offerings through asset class expansion, new geographies, and investment strategies by remaining focused on:

•

organic growth initiatives focused on building out its index and service offering;

•

acquisitions to expand into adjacent markets;

•

strategic acquisitions/partnerships to accelerate strategic areas of growth; and

•

expanding relationships with global exchanges to expand geographic reach and gain access to regional data sets.

Legal and Regulatory Environment

The financial benchmarks industry is subject to the new pending benchmark regulation in the European Union (the “E.U. Benchmark Regulation”) as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions.

The E.U. Benchmark Regulation was published June 30, 2016 and included provisions applicable to Indices and Platts, which will become effective January 1, 2018. The E.U. Benchmark Regulation requires Indices and Platts in due course to obtain registration or authorization in connection with their respective benchmark activities in Europe. This legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time, although the exact impact remains unclear.



In addition, the European Union has recently finalized a package of legislative measures known as MiFID II, which revise and update the existing E.U. Markets in Financial Instruments Directive framework. MiFID II applies in full in all E.U. Member States as of January 3, 2017. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things: (i) impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation; and (iv) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the E.U. Market Infrastructure Regulation of 2011). Although the MiFID II package is “framework” legislation (meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures to be agreed upon in the period before 2017), it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect Indices’ ability both to administer and license its indices.

In July of 2013, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) issued Financial Benchmark Principles, intended to promote the reliability of benchmark determinations, and address governance, benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices published by Indices. Even though the Financial Benchmark Principles are not binding law, Indices has taken steps to align its governance regime and operations with the Financial Benchmark Principles and engaged an independent auditor to perform a reasonable assurance review of such alignment.

The markets for index providers are very competitive. Indices competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its benchmark indices, client service, reputation, price, range of products and services (including geographic coverage) and technological innovation.  For a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Indices business, see Item 1a, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We continue to maintain a strong financial position. Our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses and our core businesses have been strong cash generators. In 2017, cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future. We use our cash for a variety of needs, including but not limited to: ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, repayment of debt, capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure.

Cash Flow Overview

Cash and cash equivalents were

$2.4 billion

as of December 31,


, an increase of

$0.9 billion

as compared to December 31,


, and consisted of approximately 30% of domestic cash and 70% of cash held abroad. Typically, cash held outside the U.S. is anticipated to be utilized to fund international operations or to be reinvested outside of the U.S., as a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years is expected to be abroad. In the event funds from international operations are needed to fund operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue for and pay taxes in the U.S. to repatriate these funds.

In


, free cash flow

increased

to

$1.2 billion

compared to

$(48.0) million

in


. The increase is primarily due to the increase in cash provided from operating activities as discussed below. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information” below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items.

Operating activities

Cash provided by operating activities

increased

$

1.3 billion

to $

1.5 billion

in

2016 compare

d to $195 million in 2015. The increase is mainly due to the payment of legal and regulatory settlements in 2015 of $1.6 billion, partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2016.

Cash provided by operating activities

decreased

$

1.0 billion

to $

195 million

in 2015 compared to $1.2 billion in 2014. The decrease is mainly due to the payment of legal and regulatory settlements in 2015 of $1.6 billion.



Investing activities

Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions.

Cash provided by investing activities

increased

to $

1.2 billion

for 2016 as compared to cash used for investing activities of $

2.5 billion

in 2015. The increase is primarily due to proceeds from the sale of J.D. Power of $1.1 billion in 2016 compared to cash used for the acquisition of SNL of $2.2 billion in 2015.

Cash used for investing activities

increased

to $

2.5 billion

for 2015 from

$65 million

in 2014, primarily due to the acquisition of SNL in 2015.

Refer to Note 2 –

Acquisitions and Divestitures

to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

Financing activities

Our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends and repayment of debt, while cash inflows are primarily inflows from long-term and short-term debt borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

Cash used for financing activities was $

1.6 billion

in 2016 compared to cash provided by financing activities of

$1.5 billion

in 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to higher proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in 2015.

Cash provided by financing activities was $

1.5 billion

in 2015 compared to cash used for financing activities of $462 million in 2014, driven by proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in 2015, partially offset by an increase in cash used for the repurchase of treasury shares.

During 2016, we used cash to repurchase 10 million shares for

$1,123 million

. In December of 2015, we repurchased 0.3 million shares for approximately $26 million, which settled in January of 2016. Using a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of J.D. Power, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement with a financial institution on September 7, 2016 to initiate share repurchases aggregating $750 million. We repurchased a total of 6.1 million shares under the ASR agreement for an average purchase price of $122.18 per share. See Note 9

Equity

for further discussion.

During 2015, we used cash to repurchase 9.8 million shares for $974 million. An additional 0.3 million shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2015 for approximately $26 million, which settled in January of 2016.

During 2014, we used cash to repurchase 4.6 million shares for $362 million. Included in the repurchase were 0.5 million shares of the Company's common stock from the personal holdings of Harold W. McGraw III, then Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and former President and CEO of the Company ("Mr. McGraw"). The shares were purchased at a discount of 0.35% from the June 24, 2014 New York Stock Exchange closing price pursuant to a private transaction with Mr. McGraw. We repurchased these shares with cash for $41 million. This transaction was approved by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors after consultation with members of the Financial Policy Committee.

On December 4, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 50 million shares, which was approximately 18% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. Our current repurchase program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions. As of

December 31, 2016

,

25.8 million

shares remained available under our current repurchase program.

Discontinued Operations

Cash flows from discontinued operations reflects the classification of McGraw Hill Construction as a discontinued operation. Cash used for operating activities from discontinued operations decreased to $129 million in 2015 compared to cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations of $18 million in 2014 due to the tax payment on the gain on sale of McGraw Hill Construction in 2015. Cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations of $320 million in 2014 relates to proceeds received from the sale of McGraw Hill Construction.

Additional Financing

We have the ability to borrow a total of

$1.2 billion

through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our revolving $1.2 billion five-year credit agreement (our "credit facility") that we entered into on June 30, 2015. This credit facility will terminate



on June 30, 2020. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2016. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2015 totaled $143 million with an average interest rate and term of 0.95% and 17 days, respectively.

Depending on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, we pay a commitment fee of


to


basis points for our credit facility, whether or not amounts have been borrowed. We currently pay a commitment fee of


basis points. The interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is, at our option, calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the Federal Funds Rate. For certain borrowings under this credit facility, there is also a spread based on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio added to the applicable rate.

Our credit facility contains certain covenants. The only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, is not greater than


to


, and this covenant level has never been exceeded.

Dividends

On

January 25, 2017

, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from

$0.36

per share to

$0.41

per share.

Contractual Obligations

We typically have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, while other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized, but are disclosed herein. For example, we are contractually committed to contracts for information-technology outsourcing, certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.

We believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital and debt service for


.

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of

December 31, 2016

, over the next several years that relate to our continuing operations. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, as referenced in the footnotes to the table:


Our debt obligations are described in Note 5 –

Debt

Amounts shown include taxes and escalation payments, see Note 13 –

Commitments and Contingencies

.


Other consists primarily of commitments for unconditional purchase obligations in contracts for information-technology outsourcing and certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance.

As of

December 31, 2016

, we had

$161 million

of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. We have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable.

As of

December 31, 2016

, we have recorded

$1,080 million

for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC partnership discussed in Note 9 –

Equity

to our consolidated financial statements.  Specifically, this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, whereby, after December 31, 2017, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC ("CGIS") will have the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy,



at least 20% of their share in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. We have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make.

We make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans. During


, we contributed

$8 million

and

$6 million

to our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans, respectively. Expected employer contributions in


are

$8 million

for each of our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans. In


, we may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status. See Note 7 –

Employee Benefits

to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of

December 31, 2016

and


, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as specific purpose or variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such we are not exposed to any financial liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.



RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to free cash flow. Additionally, we have considered certain items in evaluating free cash flow, which are included in the table below.

We believe the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. We use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase stock and fund ongoing operation and working capital needs.

The presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow excluding the impact of the items below:

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Unless otherwise indicated, all discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relate to our continuing operations.

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests. We base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.

Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this MD&A.

We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:



Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognized as it is earned when services are rendered. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are performed, fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue relating to products that provide for more than one deliverable is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each deliverable as each deliverable is provided. Revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one service is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned. If the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable, we make our best estimate of the services’ standalone selling price and recognize revenue as earned as the services are delivered. The allocation of consideration received from multiple element arrangements that involve initial assignment of ratings and the future surveillance of ratings is determined through an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately. In such cases, we defer portions of rating fees that we estimate will be attributed to future surveillance and recognize the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated surveillance periods. Advertising revenue is recognized when the page is run. Subscription income is recognized over the related subscription period.

For the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, no significant changes have been made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of revenue or the methodologies applied. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the new accounting standard of recognition of revenue will have on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 -

Accounting Policies

to our consolidated financial statements for further information. At this point, we believe the new standard will have an impact on: 1) the accounting for certain long-term deferred revenue in our Ratings segment which may contain a financing component, 2) the timing of revenue recognized in our Market and Commodities Intelligence segment for long term contracts with price escalations, and 3) the accounting for fees for historical data in our Market and Commodities Intelligence segment currently recognized over the term of a subscription. We do not expect these changes to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions. In determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators. The impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately $12 million.

For the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, there were no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in


.

Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets)

We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or management’s estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $24 million related to a technology project at our Market and Commodities segment in selling and general expenses in our consolidated statement of income.

On July 31, 2014, we completed the sale of the Company's aircraft to Harold W. McGraw III, then Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and former President and CEO of the Company for a purchase price of

$20 million

. During the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of

$6 million

in (gain) loss on dispositions in our consolidated statement of income as a result of the pending sale. See Note 14 –

Related Party Transactions

to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

On June 30, 2014, we completed the sale of our data center to Quality Technology Services, LLC (“QTS”) which owns, operates, and manages data centers. Net proceeds from the sale of

$58 million

were received in July of 2014. The sale includes all of the facilities and equipment on the south campus of our East Windsor, New Jersey location, inclusive of the rights and obligations associated with an adjoining solar power field. The sale resulted in an expense of

$3 million

recorded in (gain) loss on dispositions in our consolidated statement of income, which is in addition to the non-cash impairment charge of

$36 million

we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 to adjust the value of the facilities and associated infrastructure classified as held for sale to their fair value.



Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. As of

December 31, 2016

and


, the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was $3.7 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.

Goodwill

As part of our annual impairment test of our four reporting units, we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Reporting units are generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.  Our qualitative assessment included, but was not limited to, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key Company personnel and our share price. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. For


, based on our qualitative assessments, we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair value was greater than their respective carrying amounts.

If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge.

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

We evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If necessary, the impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. If the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach. The fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations.

We performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


.

Retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits

Our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances, including compensation increases, long-term return on pension plan assets, healthcare cost trends, discount rates and other factors. In determining such assumptions, we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from our assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants. While we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits.

The following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits:

•

Discount rate assumptions are based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds.

•

Healthcare cost trend assumptions are based on historical market data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends.



•

The expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan’s asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the long-term.

Our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our U.S. retirement plans are as follows:


At the end of 2015, we changed our approach used to measure service and interest costs on all of our retirement plans. See Note 7 –

Employee Benefits

to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

Stock-based compensation

Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is classified as both operating-related expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income.

We use a lattice-based option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted:

Because lattice-based option-pricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions, those ranges are disclosed. These assumptions are based on multiple factors, including historical exercise patterns, post-vesting termination rates, expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price. The risk-free interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield at the date of grant. We use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.

During 2015, we stopped granting stock options as part of our employees' total stock-based incentive awards. There were no stock options granted in 2016 and a minimal amount of stock options granted in 2015.

Income taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.

Judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states, and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that examinations will be settled



prior to

December 31,

2017. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits. Until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities, the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable. On the basis of present information, it is our opinion that any assessments resulting from the current audits will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

We have determined that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested within those foreign operations. Accordingly, we have not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. A future distribution by the foreign subsidiaries of these earnings could result in additional tax liability, which may be material to our future reported results, financial position and cash flows.

For the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes. However, certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes. Changes in current tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, thereby impacting our income tax provision.

Contingencies

We are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We recognize a liability for such contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter. When we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record its best estimate within the range. We disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

The fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach. Our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate Level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available, including assumptions related to expected future net cash flows, long-term growth rates, the timing and nature of tax attributes, and the redemption features.

RECENT

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See Note 1 –

Accounting Policies

to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards. We do not expect these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in future periods.

Item 7a

. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

There have been no significant changes in our exposure to market risk during the year ended December 31, 2016. Our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates. We have operations in various foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. See Note 6 –

Derivative Instruments

. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of S&P Global Inc. at

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of S&P Global Inc.

We have audited S&P Global Inc.’s (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). S&P Global Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

In our opinion, S&P Global Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of S&P Global Inc. as of

December 31, 2016

and


, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended

We classify a disposal group to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group; the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal group; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated; the sale of the disposal group is probable, and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond our control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year; the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.

An entity that is classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until the date of sale.

The fair value of a disposal group less any costs to sell is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any subsequent changes are reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Upon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group as held for sale in the current period in our consolidated balance sheets.



Discontinued Operations

Beginning on January 1, 2015, we adopted revised guidance for discontinued operations that raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation. In determining whether a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be presented as a discontinued operation, we make a determination whether the disposal represents a strategic shift that had, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results. A component of an entity comprises o

perations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished both operationally and for financial reporting purposes.  If we conclude that the disposal represents a strategic shift, then the results of operations of the group of assets being disposed of (as well as any gain or loss on the disposal transaction) are aggregated for separate presentation apart from our continuing operating results in the consolidated financial statements.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, we applied the previous guidance for discontinued operations in determining whether a group of assets disposed or to be disposed of should be presented as a discontinued operation. We determined whether the group of assets being disposed of comprised a component of the entity. We also determined whether the cash flows associated with the group of assets had been or would have been eliminated from our ongoing operations as a result of the disposal transaction and whether we would have had significant continuing involvement in the operations of the group of assets after the disposal transaction. If we concluded that the cash flows had been eliminated and we had no significant continuing involvement, then the results of operations of the group of assets being disposed of (as well as any gain or loss on the disposal transaction) were aggregated for separate presentation apart from our continuing operating results in the consolidated financial statements.

See Note 2 –

Acquisitions and Divestitures

for a summary of discontinued operations. Unless otherwise indicated, all disclosures and amounts in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to our continuing operations.

Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries and our share of earnings or losses of joint ventures and affiliated companies under the equity method of accounting. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include ordinary bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that consist primarily of money market funds with unrestricted daily liquidity and fixed term time deposits. Such investments and bank deposits are stated at cost, which approximates market value, and were

$2.4 billion

and

$1.5 billion

as of December 31,


and


, respectively. These investments are not subject to significant market risk.

Short-term investments

Short-term investments are securities with original maturities greater than 90 days that are available for use in our operations in the next twelve months. The short-term investments, primarily consisting of certificates of deposit and mutual funds, are classified as held-to-maturity and therefore are carried at cost. Interest and dividends are recorded into income when earned.

Accounts receivable

Credit is extended to customers based upon an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition. Accounts receivable, which include billings consistent with terms of contractual arrangements, are recorded at net realizable value.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions. In determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators.

Deferred technology costs

We capitalize certain software development and website implementation costs. Capitalized costs only include incremental, direct costs of materials and services incurred to develop the software after the preliminary project stage is completed, funding has been committed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Incremental costs are expenditures that are out-of-pocket to us and are not part of an allocation or existing expense base. Software development and



website implementation costs are expensed as incurred during the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs are amortized from the year the software is ready for its intended use over its estimated useful life,

three

to

seven

years, using the straight-line method. Periodically, we evaluate the amortization methods, remaining lives and recoverability of such costs. Capitalized software development and website implementation costs are included in other non-current assets and are presented net of accumulated amortization. Gross deferred technology costs were

$145 million

and

$128 million

as of December 31,


and


, respectively. Accumulated amortization of deferred technology costs was

$91 million

and

$72 million

as of December 31,


and


, respectively.

Fair Value

Certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value and classified within a fair value hierarchy based on inputs used when measuring fair value. We have an immaterial amount of forward exchange contracts that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis.

Other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity and highly liquid nature of these instruments. The fair value of our long-term debt borrowings were

$3.7 billion

and

$3.6 billion

as of December 31,


and


, respectively, and was estimated based on quoted market prices.

Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets)

We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or management’s estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of

$24 million

related to a technology project at our Market and Commodities Intelligence segment in selling and general expenses in our consolidated statement of income.

On July 31, 2014, we completed the sale of the Company's aircraft to Harold W. McGraw III, then Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and former President and CEO of the Company for a purchase price of

$20 million

. During the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of

$6 million

in (gain) loss on dispositions in our consolidated statement of income as a result of the pending sale. See Note 14 –

Related Party Transactions

for further discussion.

On June 30, 2014, we completed the sale of our data center to Quality Technology Services, LLC (“QTS”) which owns, operates, and manages data centers. Net proceeds from the sale of

$58 million

were received in July of 2014. The sale includes all of the facilities and equipment on the south campus of our East Windsor, New Jersey location, inclusive of the rights and obligations associated with an adjoining solar power field. The sale resulted in an expense of

$3 million

recorded in (gain) loss on dispositions in our consolidated statement of income, which is in addition to the non-cash impairment charge of

$36 million

we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 to adjust the value of the facilities and associated infrastructure classified as held for sale to their fair value.

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have

four

reporting units with goodwill that are evaluated for impairment.

We initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred or exist that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. If, based on our evaluation we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying amounts we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test.

When conducting the first step of our two step impairment test to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. Fair value of the reporting units are estimated using the income approach, which incorporates the use of a discounted free cash flow (“DCF”) analyses and are



corroborated using the market approach, which incorporates the use of revenue and earnings multiples based on market data. The DCF analyses are based on the current operating budgets and estimated long-term growth projections for each reporting unit. Future cash flows are discounted based on a market comparable weighted average cost of capital rate for each reporting unit, adjusted for market and other risks where appropriate. In addition, we analyze any difference between the sum of the fair values of the reporting units and our total market capitalization for reasonableness, taking into account certain factors including control premiums.

If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill. The fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge.

We evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If necessary, the impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. If the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment analysis is performed  using the income approach. The fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations.

We performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended

December 31, 2016

Foreign currency translation

We have operations in many foreign countries. For most international operations, the local currency is the functional currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the United States ("U.S.") dollar is the functional currency. For local currency operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end of period exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. Foreign currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of equity.

Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognized as it is earned when services are rendered. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are performed, fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue relating to products that provide for more than one deliverable is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each deliverable as each deliverable is provided. Revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one service is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned. If the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable, management makes its best estimate of the services’ stand-alone selling price and records revenue as it is earned over the service period. For arrangements that include multiple services, fair value of the service components are determined using an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately. Advertising revenue is recognized when the page is run. Subscription income is recognized over the related subscription period.

Depreciation

The costs of property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based upon the following estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements from


to


years and equipment and furniture from


to

10 years

. The costs of leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives or the terms of the respective leases.

Advertising expense

The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. We incurred

$35 million

,

$33 million

and

$35 million

in advertising costs for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.



Stock-based compensation

Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is classified as both operating-related expense and selling and general expense in the consolidated statements of income.

Income taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.

Judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states, and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2017. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits. Until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities, the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable. On the basis of present information, our opinion is that any assessments resulting from the current audits will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

The agreement with the minority partners of our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture established in June of 2012 contains redemption features whereby interests held by our minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Since redemption of the noncontrolling interest is outside of our control, this interest is presented on our consolidated balance sheets under the caption “Redeemable noncontrolling interest.” If the interest were to be redeemed, we would be required to purchase all of such interest at fair value on the date of redemption. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using a combination of an income and market valuation approach. Our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate Level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available, including assumptions related to expected future net cash flows, long-term growth rates, the timing and nature of tax attributes, and the redemption features. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income. See Note 9 –

Equity

for further detail.

Contingencies

We accrue for loss contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter. When we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record its best estimate within the range. We disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred.

Recent Accounting Standards

In August of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance providing amendments to eight specific statement of cash flows classification issues. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017; however, early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In March of 2016, the FASB issued guidance to modify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. This guidance will require recognizing excess tax benefits and deficiencies as income tax expense or



benefit in the statement of income, instead of in equity as under the current guidance. We reported excess tax benefits from share -based payments of

$41 million

,

$69 million

and

$128 million

for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, these amounts will be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows, instead of as a financing activity. Cash paid for shares withheld on the employees' behalf will be classified as a financing activity, instead of as an operating activity. Cash paid for employee taxes was

$55 million

,

$92 million

and

$95 million

for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2016, 2015 and 2014 amounts of excess tax benefits from share-based payments and cash paid for employee taxes are not necessarily indicative of future amounts that may arise from the implementation of the new accounting guidance.  The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 is required to be adopted as follows: 1) prospectively for the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the tax provision, 2) retrospectively or prospectively for the classification of excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the statement of cash flows, and 3) retrospectively for the classification of cash paid for shares withheld to satisfy employee taxes in the statement of cash flows.

In February of 2016, the FASB issued guidance that amends accounting for leases. Under the new guidance, a lessee will recognize

assets and liabilities but will recognize expenses similar to current lease accounting. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; however, early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented with various optional practical expedients. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

In January of 2016, the FASB issued guidance to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In November of 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. We early adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2016, prospectively, and accordingly prior year amounts have not been reclassified.

In September of 2015, the FASB issued guidance intended to simplify the accounting for measurement-period adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. The guidance eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. The guidance was effective on January 1, 2016, and the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In February of 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires management to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015; however, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In January of 2015, the FASB issued guidance that eliminates the concept of reporting extraordinary items, but retains current presentation and disclosure requirements for an event or transaction that is of an unusual nature or of a type that indicates infrequency of occurrence. Transactions that meet both criteria would now also follow such presentation and disclosure requirements. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015; however, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August of 2014, the FASB issued guidance that requires management to evaluate, at each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued and provide related disclosures. This guidance is effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May of 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) issued jointly a converged standard on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers which is intended to improve the financial reporting of revenue and comparability of the top line in financial statements globally. The core principle of the new standard is for the recognition of revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the payment to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will also result in enhanced revenue disclosures, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements. In August of 2015, the FASB issued guidance deferring the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. Subsequently, the FASB issued implementation guidance related to the new revenue standard, including the following: In March of 2016, the FASB issued guidance to clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations; in April of



2016, the FASB clarified guidance on performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance; in May of 2016, the FASB issued a practical expedient in response to identified implementation issues. The new guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the application of a transition method and the impact that adoption of these updates will have on our consolidated financial statements. At this point, we believe the new standard will have an impact on: 1) the accounting for certain long-term deferred revenue in our Ratings segment which may contain a financing component, 2) the timing of revenue recognized in our Market and Commodities Intelligence segment for long term contracts with price escalations, and 3) the accounting for fees for historical data in our Market and Commodities Intelligence segment currently recognized over the term of a subscription. We do not expect these changes to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

For acquisitions during


that were accounted for using the purchase method, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to goodwill and other intangibles. The goodwill recognized on our acquisitions is largely attributable to anticipated operational synergies and growth opportunities as a result of the acquisition. The intangible assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, will be amortized over their anticipated useful lives between


and


years which will be determined when we finalize our purchase price allocations. The goodwill for PIRA and RigData is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

18 years

.

Acquisition of SNL

Acquisition-Related Expenses

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred approximately

$37 million

of acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of SNL. These expenses are included in selling and general expenses in our consolidated statements of income.



Allocation of Purchase Price

Our acquisition of SNL was accounted for using the purchase method. Under the purchase method, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to goodwill and other intangibles. The goodwill recognized is largely attributable to anticipated operational synergies and growth opportunities as a result of the acquisition. The intangible assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, will be amortized over their anticipated useful lives between


and


years. The goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

(“BRC”), a Colombia-based ratings firm providing risk classifications of banks, financial services providers, insurance companies, corporate bonds and structured issues that will expand our presence in the Latin American credit markets. We accounted for the acquisition of BRC using the purchase method of accounting. The acquisition is not material to our consolidated financial statements.

•

Following CRISIL's acquisition of Coalition Development Ltd. ("Coalition") that occurred in July of 2012, we made a contingent purchase price payment in 2014 for

$11 million

that has been reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity.

Market and Commodities Intelligence

•

In July of 2014, we acquired Eclipse Energy Group AS and its operating subsidiaries (“Eclipse”), which provides a comprehensive suite of data and analytics products on the European natural gas and liquefied natural gas markets as well as a range of advisory services leveraging Eclipse’s knowledge base, data capabilities, and modeling suite of products. This transaction complements our North American natural gas capabilities, which we obtained from our Bentek Energy LLC acquisition in 2011. We accounted for the acquisition of Eclipse using the purchase method of accounting. The acquisition of Eclipse is not material to our consolidated financial statements.

Indices

•

In March of 2014, we acquired the intellectual property of a family of Broad Market Indices (“BMI”) from Citigroup Global Markets Inc. The BMI provides a broad measure of the global equities markets which includes approximately

11,000

companies in more than


countries covering both developed and emerging markets. We accounted for the acquisition of the intellectual property on a cost basis and it was not material to our consolidated financial statements.

For acquisitions during 2014 that were accounted for using the purchase method, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to goodwill and other intangibles. Intangible assets recorded for all transactions are amortized using the straight-line method for periods not exceeding

7 years

. None of the goodwill acquired from our acquisitions during 2014 will be deductible for tax purposes.

Non-cash investing activities

Liabilities assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of businesses are as follows:

Divestitures - Continuing Operations

In November of 2016, we entered into a put option agreement that gave the Company the right, but not the obligation, to put the entire share capital of Quant House SAS ("QuantHouse"), included in our Market and Commodities Intelligence segment, to QH Holdco, an independent third party. As a result, we classified the assets and liabilities of QuantHouse, net of our costs to sell, as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 resulting in an aggregate loss of

$31 million

. On January 4, 2017, we exercised the put option, thereby entering into a definitive agreement to sell QuantHouse to QH Holdco. On January 9, 2017, we completed the sale of QuantHouse to QH Holdco.


During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, we completed the following dispositions that resulted in a net pre-tax gain of

$1.1 billion

, which was included in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income:

December 31, 2015

, we recorded a pre-tax gain of

$11 million

in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of our interest in a legacy McGraw Hill Construction investment.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we began exploring strategic alternatives for J.D. Power, included within our Market and Commodities Intelligence segment, and initiated an active program to sell the business. The assets and liabilities of J.D. Power were classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

3. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired.

The change in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment is shown below:


Relates to J.D. Power, which is classified as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

Goodwill additions and dispositions in the table above relate to transactions discussed in Note 2 –

Acquisitions and Divestitures

.

Other Intangible Assets

Other intangible assets include both indefinite-lived assets not subject to amortization and definite-lived assets subject to amortization. We have indefinite-lived assets with a carrying value of

$714 million

as of

December 31, 2016

and


that consist of the following:

•

$380 million

and

$90 million

for Dow Jones Indices intellectual property and the Dow Jones tradename, respectively, that we recorded as part of the transaction to form S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC in 2012.

•

$185 million

within our Market and Commodities Intelligence segment for the SNL tradename.

•

$

59 million

within our Indices segment for the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index intellectual property and the Broad Market Indices intellectual property.



The following table summarizes our definite-lived intangible assets:


Relates to J.D. Power, which is classified as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.


Relates to a technology-related impairment charge at Market and Commodities Intelligence and recorded in selling and general expenses in our consolidated statement of income.

Definite-lived intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of up to


years. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets as of

December 31, 2016

is approximately


years.

Amortization expense for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


was

$96 million

,

$67 million

, and

$48 million

, respectively. Expected amortization expense for intangible assets over the next five years for the years ended December 31, assuming no further acquisitions or dispositions, is as follows:



4. Taxes on Income

Income before taxes on income resulted from domestic and foreign operations is as follows:

The provision for taxes on income consists of the following:

A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate for financial reporting purposes is as follows:



The principal temporary differences between the accounting for income and expenses for financial reporting and income tax purposes are as follows:

In November of 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. We early adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2016, prospectively, and accordingly prior year amounts have not been reclassified.

We record valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not based upon all the available evidence that such deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance is primarily related to operating losses.

We have not recorded deferred income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations amounted to

$1.7 billion

at

December 31, 2016

. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable.

We made net income tax payments for continuing and discontinued operations totaling

$683 million

in


,

$260 million

in


, and

$419 million

in


. As of

December 31, 2016

, we had net operating loss carryforwards of

$446 million

, of which a major portion has an unlimited carryover period under current law.



A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The total amount of federal, state and local, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits as of

December 31, 2016

,


and


was

$161 million

,

$120 million

and

$118 million

, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. The increase of

$46 million

in 2016 (excluding settlements) is the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that unfavorably impacted tax expense. The unfavorable impact to the tax provision was partially offset by the resolution of tax audits in multiple jurisdictions.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating-related expense, respectively. In addition to the unrecognized tax benefits, as of

December 31, 2016

and


, we had

$44 million

and

$31 million

, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions.

During 2016, we completed the federal income tax audit for 2014. The U.S. federal income tax audits for 2016 and 2015 are in process. During 2016, we completed various state and foreign tax audits and, with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2008. The impact to tax expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was not material.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states, and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2017. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period, we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits. Until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities, the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable.

5. Debt

Annual long-term debt maturities are scheduled as follows based on book values as of

December 31, 2016

:

no

amounts due in 2017,

$398 million

due in 2018,

no

amounts due in 2019,

$696 million

due in 2020,

no

amounts due in 2021, and

$2.5 billion

due thereafter.

On September 22, 2016, we issued

$500 million

of

2.95%

senior notes due in 2027. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC. We used the net proceeds to fund the

$400 million

early repayment of our

5.9%

senior notes due in 2017 on October 20, 2016, and intend to use the balance for general corporate purposes.

On August 18, 2015, we issued

$2.0 billion

of senior notes consisting of

$400 million

of

2.5%

senior notes due in 2018,

$700 million

of

3.3%

senior notes due in 2020 and

$900 million

of

4.4%

senior notes due in 2026. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC. We used the net proceeds to finance the acquisition of SNL.

On May 26, 2015, we issued

$700 million

of

4.0%

senior notes due in 2025 and used a portion of the net proceeds for the repayment of short-term debt, including commercial paper. The

4.0%

senior notes will mature on June 15, 2025 and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC.

We have the ability to borrow a total of

$1.2 billion

through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our revolving

$1.2 billion

five

-year credit agreement (our "credit facility") that we entered into on June 30, 2015. This credit facility will terminate on June 30, 2020. There were

no

commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of

December 31, 2016

. Commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2015 totaled

$143 million

with an average interest rate and term of

0.95%

and

17 days

, respectively.

Depending on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, we pay a commitment fee of


to


basis points for our credit facility, whether or not amounts have been borrowed. We currently pay a commitment fee of


basis points. The interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is, at our option, calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the Federal Funds Rate. For certain borrowings under this credit facility, there is also a spread based on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio added to the applicable rate.

Our credit facility contains certain covenants. The only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, is not greater than


to


, and this covenant level has never been exceeded.

6.

Derivative Instruments

Cash Flow Hedges

Our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates. We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our Indian Rupee exposure through the fourth quarter of 2016. These contracts were intended to offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs and matured at the end of each quarter during 2016. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and are subsequently reclassified into selling and general expenses in the same period that the hedge contract matures. As of

December 31, 2016

, we



estimate that

$2 million

of the net gains related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. There was

no

hedge ineffectiveness for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

As of

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

, the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was

$65 million

and

$58 million

, respectively.

The following table provides information on the location and fair value amounts of our cash flow hedges as of

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

:


We use the income approach to measure the fair value of our forward currency forward contracts. The income approach uses pricing models that rely on observable inputs such as forward rates, and therefore are classified as Level 2.

The following table provides information on the location and amounts of pre-tax gains (losses) on our cash flow hedges for the  years ended

December 31

:

The activity related to the change in unrealized gains (losses) in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows for the years ended

December 31

:

7. Employee Benefits

We maintain a number of active defined contribution retirement plans for our employees. The majority of our defined benefit plans are frozen. As a result, no new employees will be permitted to enter these plans and no additional benefits for current participants in the frozen plans will be accrued.

We also have supplemental benefit plans that provide senior management with supplemental retirement, disability and death benefits. Certain supplemental retirement benefits are based on final monthly earnings. In addition, we sponsor voluntary 401(k) plans under which we may match employee contributions up to certain levels of compensation as well as profit-sharing plans under which we contribute a percentage of eligible employees' compensation to the employees' accounts.

We also provide certain medical, dental and life insurance benefits for active and retired employees and eligible dependents. The medical and dental plans and supplemental life insurance plan are contributory, while the basic life insurance plan is noncontributory. We currently do not prefund any of these plans.



We recognize the funded status of our retirement and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes. The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income represent net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to our accounting policy for amortizing such amounts.

Benefit Obligation

A summary of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, as well as the funded status for the retirement and postretirement plans as of

December 31,

is as follows (benefits paid in the table below include only those amounts contributed directly to or paid directly from plan assets):

The actuarial loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss for our retirement plans and expected to be recognized in net periodic pension cost during the year ending December 31,


is

$18 million

. There is

no

prior service credit included in



accumulated other comprehensive loss for our retirement plans expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost during the year ending December 31,


.

There is an immaterial amount of actuarial loss and prior service credit included in accumulated other comprehensive loss for our postretirement plans expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost during the year ending December 31,


.

Net Periodic Benefit Cost

For purposes of determining annual pension cost, prior service costs are being amortized straight-line over the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants expected to receive benefits.

A summary of net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and postretirement plans for the years ended

December 31,

is as follows:


The curtailment gain for our postretirement plans in 2014 is a result of plan changes effective October 31, 2014 eliminating retiree medical and life insurance benefits for active employees not retiring by July 1, 2016.

Our U.K. retirement plan accounted for a benefit of

$10 million

in


,

$10 million

in


, and

$8 million

in


of the net periodic benefit cost attributable to the funded plans.

Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax for the years ended

December 31,

are as follows:

The total cost for our retirement plans was

$69 million

for


,

$91 million

for


and

$81 million

for


. Included in the total retirement plans cost are defined contribution plans cost of

$65 million

for


,

$67 million

for


and

$74 million

for


.



Assumptions


The assumed weighted-average healthcare cost trend rate will decrease ratably from

7%

in 2016 to

5%

in 2024 and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed healthcare cost trends have an effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans. A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend creates the following effects:


Effective January 1, 2016, we changed our discount rate assumption on our U.S. retirement plans to

4.47%

from

4.15%

in 2015 and changed our discount rate assumption on our U.K. plan to

3.84%

from

3.8%

in 2015. At the end of 2015, we changed our approach used to measure service and interest costs on all of our retirement plans. For 2015 and prior periods presented, we measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation. For 2016, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. We believe this new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. This change does not affect the measurement of our benefit obligation. We have accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle and, accordingly, have accounted for it on a prospective basis. Pension and postretirement medical costs decreased by approximately

$14 million

in 2016 as a result of this change.


The expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan’s asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the long-term. Effective January 1,


, our return on assets assumption for the U.S. plan and U.K. plan remained unchanged at

6.25%

.

Cash Flows

In December of 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) was enacted. The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, known as “Medicare Part D”, and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Our benefits provided to certain participants are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D, and, accordingly, we are entitled to a subsidy.

Expected employer contributions in


are

$8 million

for each of our retirement and postretirement plans. In


, we may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status. Information about the expected cash flows for our retirement and postretirement plans and the impact of the Medicare subsidy is as follows:


Reflects the total benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants’ share of the cost.


Reflects the total benefits expected to be paid from our assets.




Expected medicare subsidy amounts, for the years presented, are less than

$1 million

.

Fair Value of Plan Assets

In accordance with authoritative guidance for fair value measurements certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

•

Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

•

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.



The fair value of our defined benefit plans assets as of

December 31, 2016

and


, by asset class is as follows:


Includes securities that are tracked in the S&P Smallcap 600 index.


Includes securities that are mainly investment grade obligations of issuers in the U.S.


Includes U.S. mortgage-backed securities that are not backed by the U.S. government.


Includes a fund which holds real estate properties in the U.K.



For securities that are quoted in active markets, the trustee/custodian determines fair value by applying securities’ prices obtained from its pricing vendors. For commingled funds that are not actively traded, the trustee applies pricing information provided by investment management firms to the unit quantities of such funds. Investment management firms employ their own pricing vendors to value the securities underlying each commingled fund. Underlying securities that are not actively traded derive their prices from investment managers, which in turn, employ vendors that use pricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow, comparables). The domestic defined benefit plans have no investment in our stock, except through the S&P 500 commingled trust index fund.

The trustee obtains estimated prices from vendors for securities that are not easily quotable and they are categorized accordingly as Level 3. The following table details further information on our plan assets where we have used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):

Pension Trusts’ Asset Allocations

There are

two

pension trusts,

one

in the U.S. and

one

in the U.K.

•

The U.S. pension trust had assets of

$1.6 billion

as of December 31,


and


, and the target allocations in


include

68%

debt securities and short-term investments,

27%

domestic equities and

5%

international equities.

•

The U.K. pension trust had assets of

$441 million

and

$425 million

as of December 31,


and


, respectively, and the target allocations in


include

40%

fixed income,

30%

diversified growth funds,

20%

equities and

10%

real estate .

The pension assets are invested with the goal of producing a combination of capital growth, income and a liability hedge. The mix of assets is established after consideration of the long-term performance and risk characteristics of asset classes. Investments are selected based on their potential to enhance returns, preserve capital and reduce overall volatility. Holdings are diversified within each asset class. The portfolios employ a mix of index and actively managed equity strategies by market capitalization, style, geographic regions and economic sectors. The fixed income strategies include U.S. long duration securities, opportunistic fixed income securities and U.K. debt instruments. The short-term portfolio, whose primary goal is capital preservation for liquidity purposes, is composed of government and government-agency securities, uninvested cash, receivables and payables. The portfolios do not employ any financial leverage.

U.S. Defined Contribution Plans

Assets of the defined contribution plans in the U.S. consist primarily of investment options which include actively managed equity, indexed equity, actively managed equity/bond funds, target date funds, S&P Global Inc. common stock, stable value and money market strategies. There is also a self-directed mutual fund investment option. The plans purchased

216,035

shares and sold

437,283

shares of S&P Global Inc. common stock in


and purchased

223,656

shares and sold

247,984

shares of S&P Global Inc. common stock in


. The plans held approximately

, with market values of

$171 million

and

8. Stock-Based Compensation

We issue stock-based incentive awards to our eligible employees and Directors under the 2002 Employee Stock Incentive Plan and a Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan.

•

2002 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2002 Plan”)

– The 2002 Plan permits the granting of nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance stock, restricted stock and other stock-based awards.

•

Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan

– Under this plan, common stock reserved may be credited to deferred stock accounts for eligible Directors. In general, the plan requires that

50%

of eligible Directors’ annual compensation plus dividend equivalents be credited to deferred stock accounts. Each Director may also elect to defer all or a portion of the remaining compensation and have an equivalent number of shares credited to the deferred stock account. Recipients under this plan are not required to provide consideration to us other than rendering service. Shares will be delivered as of the



date a recipient ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors or within

five years

thereafter, if so elected. The plan will remain in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors or until no shares of stock remain available under the plan.

The number of common shares reserved for issuance are as follows:


Shares reserved for issuance under the Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan are not included in the total, but are approximately

0.1 million

.

We issue treasury shares upon exercise of stock options and the issuance of restricted stock and unit awards. To offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options, we periodically repurchase shares. See Note 9 –

Equity

for further discussion.

Stock-based compensation expense and the corresponding tax benefit are as follows:

Stock-based compensation of

$2 million

is recorded in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of the sale of McGraw Hill Construction described further in Note 2 –

Acquisitions and Divestitures

.

Stock Options

Stock options may not be granted at a price less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options granted vest over a

three

year service period in equal annual installments and have a maximum term of

10 years

. Stock option compensation costs are recognized from the date of grant, utilizing a

three

-year graded vesting method. Under this method, one-third of the costs are ratably recognized over the first

twelve months

, one-third of the costs are ratably recognized over a

twenty-four

month period starting from the date of grant with the remaining costs ratably recognized over a

thirty-six

month period starting from the date of grant.

We use a lattice-based option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted:

Because lattice-based option-pricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions, those ranges are disclosed. These assumptions are based on multiple factors, including historical exercise patterns, post-vesting termination rates, expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price. The risk-free interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield at the date of grant. We use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.



During 2015, we stopped granting stock options as part of our employees' total stock-based incentive awards. There were

no

stock options granted in 2016 and a minimal amount of stock options granted in 2015.

Stock option activity is as follows:


There is less than

$1 million

of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested options.

The total fair value of our stock options that vested during the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


was

$7 million

,

$11 million

and

$6 million

, respectively.

Information regarding our stock option exercises is as follows:

Restricted Stock and Unit Awards

Restricted stock and unit awards (performance and non-performance) have been granted under the 2002 Plan. Performance unit awards will vest only if we achieve certain financial goals over the performance period. Restricted stock non-performance awards have various vesting periods (generally

three years

), with vesting beginning on the first anniversary of the awards. Recipients of restricted stock and unit awards are not required to provide consideration to us other than rendering service.

The stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and unit awards is determined based on the market price of our stock at the grant date of the award applied to the total number of awards that are anticipated to fully vest. For performance unit awards, adjustments are made to expense dependent upon financial goals achieved.



Restricted stock and unit activity for performance and non-performance awards is as follows:

For the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


,

$41 million

,

$69 million

and

$128 million

, respectively, of excess tax benefits from stock options exercises and restricted stock and unit award vestings are reported in our cash flows used for financing activities.

9. Equity

Capital Stock

Two million

shares of preferred stock, par value

none

have been issued.

On

January 25, 2017

, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the dividends for


to a quarterly rate of

$0.41

Stock Repurchases

On December 4, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of

50 million

shares, which was approximately

18%

of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time.

Share repurchases were as follows:


2016 includes shares received as part of our accelerated share repurchase agreement as described in more detail below.


In December of 2015,

0.3 million

shares were repurchased for approximately

$26 million

, which settled in January of 2016. Excluding these

0.3 million

shares, the average price paid per share was

$98.98

. In December of 2013,

0.1 million

shares were repurchased for



approximately

$10 million

, which settled in January of 2014. Cash used for financing activities only reflects those shares which settled during the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 resulting in

$1,123 million

,

$974 million

and

$362 million

of cash used to repurchase shares, respectively.


On June 25, 2014, we repurchased

0.5 million

shares of the Company's common stock from the personal holdings of Harold W. McGraw III, then Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and former President and CEO of the Company, at a discount of

0.35%

from the June 24, 2014 New York Stock Exchange closing price. We repurchased these shares with cash for

$41 million

at an average price of

$82.66

per share. See Note 14

—

Related Party Transactions

for further information.

Our purchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. As of December 31,


,

25.8 million

shares remained available under our current share repurchase program. Our current share repurchase program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions.

Accelerated Share Repurchase Program

Using a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of J.D. Power, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreement with a financial institution on September 7, 2016 to initiate share repurchases aggregating

$750 million

. The ASR agreement was structured as a capped ASR agreement in which we paid

$750 million

and received an initial delivery of approximately

4.4 million

shares and an additional amount of

0.9 million

shares during the month of September 2016, representing the minimum number of shares of our common stock to be repurchased based on a calculation using a specified capped price per share. We completed the ASR agreement on December 7, 2016 and received an additional

0.9 million

shares, which settled on December 12, 2016. We repurchased a total of

6.1 million

shares under the ASR agreement for an average purchase price of

$122.18

per share. The total number of shares repurchased under the ASR agreement was based on the volume weighted-average share price, minus a discount, of our common stock over the term of the ASR agreement. The repurchased shares are held in Treasury. The ASR agreement was executed under the current share repurchase program, approved on December 4, 2013.

The ASR agreement was accounted for as two transactions: a stock purchase transaction and a forward stock purchase contract. The shares delivered under the ASR agreement resulted in a reduction of our outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share. The forward stock purchase contract was classified as an equity instrument.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

The agreement with the minority partners of our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC partnership contains redemption features whereby interests held by minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Specifically, under the terms of the operating agreement of Indices LLC, after December 31,


, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC ("CGIS") will have the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least

20%

of their share in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. In addition, in the event there is a change of control of the Company, for the


days following a change in control, CME Group and CGIS will have the right to put their interest to us at the then fair value of CME Group's and CGIS' minority interest.

If interests were to be redeemed under this agreement, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on the date of redemption. This interest is presented on the consolidated balance sheets outside of equity under the caption “Redeemable noncontrolling interest” with an initial value based on fair value for the portion attributable to the net assets we acquired, and based on our historical cost for the portion attributable to our S&P Index business. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, considering a combination of an income and market valuation approach. Our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available, including assumptions related to expected future net cash flows, long-term growth rates, the timing and nature of tax attributes, and the redemption features. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income.

Noncontrolling interests that do not contain such redemption features are presented in equity.



Ch

anges to redeemable noncontrolling interest during the year ended

December 31, 2016

were as follows:

10. Earnings (Loss) per Share

Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the common shareholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed in the same manner as basic earnings (loss) per share, except the number of shares is increased to include additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued. Potential common shares consist primarily of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units calculated using the treasury stock method.



The calculation for basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share is as follows:

Each period we have certain stock options and restricted performance shares that are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share. The effect of the potential exercise of stock options is excluded when the average market price of our common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related option during the period or when a loss from continuing operations exists because the effect would have been antidilutive. Additionally, restricted performance shares are excluded because the necessary vesting conditions had not been met or when a loss from continuing operations exists. As of

December 31, 2016

and 2015, there were

no

stock options excluded as compared to

2.9 million

stock options excluded for the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, restricted performance shares outstanding of

0.7 million

,

0.9 million

and

3.2 million

as of

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively, were excluded.

11. Restructuring

During


and


, we continued to evaluate our cost structure and further identified cost savings associated with streamlining our management structure and our decision to exit non-strategic businesses. Our


and


restructuring plans consisted of a company-wide workforce reduction of approximately


positions and


positions, respectively, and are further detailed below. The charges for each restructuring plan are classified as selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income and the reserves are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

In certain circumstances, reserves are no longer needed because of efficiencies in carrying out the plans or because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were reassigned due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated. In these cases, we reverse reserves through the consolidated statements of income during the period when it is determined they are no longer needed. There was approximately

$7 million

of reserves from the 2015 restructuring plan that we have reversed in 2016, which offset the initial charge of

$63 million

recorded for the 2015 restructuring plan. Also, there was approximately

$7 million

of reserves from the 2014 restructuring plan that we have reversed in 2015, which offset the initial charge of

$86 million

recorded for the 2014 restructuring plan.



The initial restructuring charge recorded and the ending reserve balance as of

December 31, 2016

by segment is as follows:

For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, we have reduced the reserve for the


restructuring plan by

$7 million

and for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, we have reduced the reserve for the


restructuring plan by

$40 million

and

$13 million

, respectively. The reductions primarily related to cash payments for employee severance costs.

12. Segment and Geographic Information

As discussed in Note 1 –

Accounting Policies

, we have

three

reportable segments: Ratings, Market and Commodities Intelligence and Indices.

Our Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision-maker and evaluates performance of our segments and allocates resources based primarily on operating profit. Segment operating profit does not include unallocated expense or interest expense, as these are costs that do not affect the operating results of our segments. We use the same accounting policies for our segments as those described in Note 1 –

Accounting Policie

s.

Effective beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of these segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts are included in a new reportable segment named Market and Commodities Intelligence. Our historical segment reporting has been retroactively revised to reflect the current organizational structure.

Segment information for the years ended December 31 is as follows:


Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily includes a benefit related to net legal settlement insurance recoveries of

$10 million

Segment information as of December 31 is as follows:


Corporate assets consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, assets for pension benefits, deferred income taxes and leasehold improvements related to subleased areas.


Includes QuantHouse and J.D. Power as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

We have operations with foreign revenue and long-lived assets in approximately


countries. We do not have operations in any foreign country that represent more than

8%

of our consolidated revenue. Transfers between geographic areas are recorded at agreed upon prices and intercompany revenue and profit are eliminated. No single customer accounted for more than

10%

of our consolidated revenue.

The following provides revenue and long-lived assets by geographic region:

Divestitures

and Note 11 –

Restructuring

, for actions that impacted the segment operating results.

13. Commitments and Contingencies

Rental Expense and Lease Obligations

We are committed under lease arrangements covering property, computer systems and office equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their economic lives or their lease term. Certain lease arrangements contain escalation clauses covering increased costs for various defined real estate taxes and operating services and the associated fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease period.

Rental expense for property and equipment under all operating lease agreements is as follows:

In December of 2003, we sold our

45%

equity investment in Rock-McGraw, Inc., which owned our then headquarters building in New York City, and remained an anchor tenant by concurrently leasing back space from the buyer through 2020. Proceeds from the disposition were

$382 million

and the sale resulted in a pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of

$131 million

(

$58 million

after-tax) upon disposition. As a result of the amount of building space we retained through our leaseback, a pre-tax gain of

$212 million

(

$126 million

after-tax) was deferred upon the disposition in 2003. In December of 2013, we entered into an arrangement with the buyer to shorten the lease to December of 2015 in exchange for approximately

$60 million

which was recorded as a reduction to the unrecognized deferred gain from the sale. The remaining gain was amortized over the remaining lease term as a reduction in rent expense. The amount of gain recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was

$4 million

and

$21 million

, respectively. The lease terminated in December of 2015.

Cash amounts for future minimum rental commitments under existing non-cancelable leases with a remaining term of more than one year, along with minimum sublease rental income to be received under non-cancelable subleases are shown in the following table.



Legal & Regulatory Matters

In the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries. Many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of S&P Global Ratings brought by issuers and alleged purchasers of rated securities. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to ratings activities and antitrust matters. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.

The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the pending claims and potential claims in the matters described below and is diligently pursuing these defenses, and in some cases working to reach an acceptable negotiated resolution. However, in view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of these matters or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that the outcome of the matters described below will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we will continue to review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business and competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.

With respect to the matters identified below, we have recognized a liability when both (a) information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred as of the date of these financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated.

S&P Global Ratings

Financial Crisis Litigation

The Company and its subsidiaries continue to defend civil cases brought by private and public plaintiffs arising out of ratings activities prior to and during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Included in these civil cases are

seven

lawsuits in Australia against the Company and Standard & Poor’s International, LLC relating to alleged investment losses in collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) rated by S&P Global Ratings.  Discovery in certain of these cases, including the Australia matters, is ongoing. We can provide no assurance that we will not be obligated to pay significant amounts in order to resolve these matters on terms deemed acceptable.

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission

As a nationally recognized statistical rating organization registered with the SEC under Section 15E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, S&P Global Ratings is in ongoing communication with the staff of the SEC regarding compliance with its extensive obligations under the federal securities laws. Although S&P Global Ratings seeks to promptly address any compliance issues that it detects or that the staff of the SEC raises, there can be no assurance that the SEC will not seek remedies against S&P Global Ratings for one or more compliance deficiencies.

Trani Prosecutorial Proceeding

The prosecutor in the Italian city of Trani has obtained criminal indictments against several current and former S&P Global Ratings managers and ratings analysts for alleged market manipulation, and against Standard & Poor’s Credit Market Services Europe under Italy’s vicarious liability statute, for having allegedly failed to properly supervise the ratings analysts and prevent them from committing market manipulation. The prosecutor’s theories are based on various actions by S&P Global Ratings taken with respect to Italian sovereign debt between May of 2011 and January of 2012. Trial commenced in February of 2015 and closing arguments are scheduled for January and February of 2017. Apart from criminal penalties that might be imposed following a conviction, such conviction could also lead to civil damages claims and other sanctions against Standard & Poor’s Credit Market Services Europe or the Company. Such claims and sanctions cannot be quantified at this stage.

Shareholder Derivative Actions

In August of 2015,

two

purported shareholders commenced a putative derivative action on behalf of the Company in New York State Supreme Court titled Retirement Plan for General Employees of the City of North Miami Beach and Robin Stein v. Harold McGraw III, et al. The complaint asserts claims for, inter alia, breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and



mismanagement against the board of directors, certain former directors of the Company, and

three

former S&P Global Ratings employees. Plaintiffs seek recovery from the defendants based primarily on allegations that S&P Global Ratings’ credit ratings practices for certain residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations misrepresented the credit risks of those securities, allegedly resulting in losses to the Company. The Company and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint in October of 2015. Plaintiffs filed an opposition in December of 2015, and the Company and the individual defendants filed their reply briefs in January of 2016.

In January of 2016, a different purported shareholder commenced a separate putative derivative action on behalf of the Company in New York State Supreme Court titled L.A. Grika v. Harold McGraw III, et al. The allegations in the complaint are substantially similar to those in the North Miami Beach matter described above. The complaint asserts claims for, inter alia, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, contribution and indemnification against Harold McGraw III, Douglas L. Peterson, and

nine

former S&P Global Ratings employees. The case was transferred to the judge presiding over the North Miami Beach action. The Company and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the Grika complaint in May of 2016. Plaintiffs filed an opposition in June of 2016, and the Company and the individual defendants filed their reply briefs in July of 2016.

The court notified the parties in August of 2016 that it will be issuing written decisions on the outstanding motions to dismiss without oral argument.  In December 2016, the court issued

two

orders granting the motions to dismiss in both the North Miami Beach and the Grika matters.  In January 2017, the plaintiffs in the North Miami Beach and Grika matters filed notices of appeal of the court’s dismissal of those actions.

14.

Related Party Transactions

On July 31, 2014, we completed the sale of the Company's aircraft to Harold W. McGraw III, then Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and former President and CEO of the Company ("Mr. McGraw") for a purchase price of

$20 million

, which  was modestly higher than the independent appraisal obtained. This transaction was approved by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors after consultation with members of the Financial Policy Committee. During the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of

$6 million

in (gain) loss on dispositions in our consolidated statement of income as a result of the pending sale.

On June 25, 2014, we repurchased

0.5 million

shares of the Company's common stock from the personal holdings of Mr. McGraw. The shares were purchased at a discount of

0.35%

from the June 24, 2014 New York Stock Exchange closing price pursuant to a private transaction with Mr. McGraw. We repurchased these shares with cash for

$41 million

at an average price of

$82.66

per share. This transaction was approved by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors after consultation with members of the Financial Policy Committee.

In June of 2012, we entered into a license agreement (the "License Agreement") with the holder of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC noncontrolling interest, CME Group, which replaced the 2005 license agreement between Indices and CME Group. Under the terms of the License Agreement, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC receives a share of the profits from the trading and clearing of CME Group's equity index products. During the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC earned

$76 million

,

$63 million

and

$52 million

of revenue under the terms of the License Agreement, respectively. The entire amount of this revenue is included in our consolidated statement of income and the portion related to the

27%

noncontrolling interest is removed in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

As of

December 31, 2016

, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, management is required to provide the following report on our internal control over financial reporting:

1.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.

2.

Management has evaluated the system of internal control using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework (“COSO 2013 framework”). Management has selected the COSO 2013 framework for its evaluation as it is a control framework recognized by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that is free from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurement of our internal controls, is sufficiently complete so that relevant controls are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting.

3.

Based on management’s evaluation under this framework, management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of

December 31, 2016

. There are no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that have been identified by management.

4.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited our consolidated financial statements for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, and has issued their reports on the financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These reports are located on pages 53 and 54 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Other Information

IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT DISCLOSURE

Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether, during the reporting period, it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or



entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Revenue in 2016 attributable to the transactions or dealings by the Company described below was approximately $790,900 with net profit from such sales being a fraction of the revenues.

During 2016, one of the Company’s divisions, a provider of energy-related information in over 150 countries, sold information and informational materials, which are generally exempt from U.S. economic sanctions, to fifteen subscribers that are owned or controlled, or appear to be owned or controlled, by the Government of Iran (the “GOI”), including one that was also designated by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) pursuant to Executive Order 13382 for part of the first quarter of 2016.  The Company, among other things, offers customers that subscribe to its publications access to proprietary data, analytics, and industry information that enable commodities markets to perform with greater transparency and efficiency.  This division provided such data related to the energy and petrochemicals markets to the subscribers referenced above, generating revenue that was a de minimis portion of both the division's and the Company’s revenue.  One of the subscribers is designated by OFAC as a GOI entity and was, until January 16, 2016, designated by OFAC pursuant to Executive Order 13382;  seven of the subscribers are designated by OFAC as GOI entities; and seven appear, based on publicly available information, to be owned or controlled by GOI entities.  We believe that these transactions were permissible under U.S. sanctions pursuant to certain statutory and regulatory exemptions for the exportation of information and informational materials.  The Company will continue to monitor its provision of products and services to these Iranian customers so that such activity continues to be permissible under U.S. sanctions.
