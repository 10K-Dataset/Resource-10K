Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief
Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

As of December 31, 2004, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and
with the participation of the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management,
including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of December 31, 2004.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Section 404) and as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
management is required to provide the following report on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting:

1.

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
Company.

2.

The Company’s management has used the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) framework to
evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting. Management has selected the COSO framework for its evaluation
as it is a control framework recognized by the SEC and the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, that is free from bias, permits reasonably
consistent qualitative and quantitative measurement of the Company’s
internal controls, is sufficiently complete so that relevant controls are
not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal controls over
financial reporting.



3.

As of December 31, 2004, management has assessed the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting,
and has concluded that such control over financial reporting is effective.
There are no material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting that have been identified by management.

4.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
firm, Ernst & Young LLP, have audited the consolidated financial statements
of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2004 and have issued their
reports on the financial statements and management’s assessment as to the
effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting under Auditing
Standard No. 2 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. These
reports are located on pages 64 and 65 of the 2004 Annual Report to
Shareholders.

Other Matters

During 2004, the Global Transformation Project (GTP), which began in 2002, was
successfully launched in the domestic School Education Group as well as for the
higher education and professional publishing units. GTP, which was also launched
in Canada in 2003, supports the McGraw-Hill Education segment’s global growth
objectives, provides technological enhancements to strengthen the infrastructure
of management information and customer-centric services and enables process and
production improvements throughout the organization.

Except as noted above, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal
controls over financial reporting during the most recent quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Included in this number are 20,617,243 shares to be issued upon exercise
of outstanding options under the Company’s Stock Incentive Plans and 75,644
deferred units already credited but to be issued under the Director Deferred Stock
Ownership Plan.

(2)

Included in this number are 285,985 shares reserved for issuance under
the Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan. The remaining 11,295,170 shares are
reserved for issuance under the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2002 Plan”) for
Performance Stock, Restricted Stock, Other Stock-Based Awards, Stock Options and
Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”).

(3)

Under the terms of the 2002 Plan, shares subject to an award (other than
a stock option, SAR, or dividend equivalent) or shares paid in settlement of a
dividend equivalent reduce the number of shares available under the 2002 Plan by
one share for each such share granted or paid; shares subject to a stock option or
SAR reduce the number of shares available under the 2002 Plan by one-third of a
share for each such share granted. The 2002 Plan stipulates that in no case, as a
result of such share counting, may more than 9,500,000 shares of stock be issued
thereunder. Accordingly, for purposes of setting forth the figures in this column,
the base figure from which issuances of stock awards are deducted, is deemed to be
9,500,000 shares for the 2002 Plan plus shares reserved for grant immediately
prior to the amendments to the 2002 Plan of April 28, 2004.

The 2002 Plan is also governed by certain share recapture provisions. The
aggregate number of shares of stock available under the 2002 Plan for issuance
are increased by the number of shares of stock granted as an award under the
2002 Plan or 1993 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “1993 Plan”)(other than
stock option, SAR or 1993 Plan stock option
awards) or by one-third of the number of shares of stock in the case of



stock
option, SAR or 1993 Plan stock option awards that are, in each case: forfeited,
settled in cash or property other than stock, or otherwise not distributable
under an award under the Plan; tendered or withheld to pay the exercise or
purchase price of an award under the 2002 or 1993 Plans or to satisfy applicable
wage or other required tax withholding in connection with the exercise, vesting
or payment of, or other event related to, an award under the 2002 or 1993 Plan;
or repurchased by the Company with the option proceeds in respect of the
exercise of a stock option under the 2002 or 1993 Plans.
