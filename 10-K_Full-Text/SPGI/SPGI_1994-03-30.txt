                                     PART I


Item 1.  Business
The Registrant, incorporated in December 1925, serves business, professional
and educational markets around the world with information products and
services.  Key markets include finance, business, education, law, construction,
medical and health, computers and communications, aerospace and defense.  As a
multimedia publishing and information company, the Registrant employs a broad
range of media, including books, magazines, newsletters, software, on-line data
services, CD-ROMs, facsimile and television broadcasting.  Most of the
Registrant's products and services face substantial competition from a variety
of sources.

The Registrant's 15,661 employees are located worldwide.  They perform the
vital functions of analyzing the nature of changing demands for information and
of channeling the resources necessary to fill those demands.  By virtue of the
numerous copyrights and licensing, trade, and other agreements, which are
essential to such a business, the Registrant is able to collect, compile, and
disseminate this information.  Substantially all book manufacturing and
magazine printing is handled through a number of independent contractors.  The
Registrant's principal raw material is paper, and the Registrant has assured
sources of supply, at competitive prices, adequate for its business needs.

Descriptions of the company's principal products, broad services and markets,
and significant achievements are hereby incorporated by reference from Exhibit
(13), pages 2 and 3 and pages 7 through 22 (textual material) of the
Registrant's 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders.

Information as to Industry Segments
The relative contribution of the industry segments of the Registrant and its
subsidiaries to operating revenue and operating profit and geographic
information for the three years ended December 31, 1993 and the identifiable
assets of each segment at the end of each year, are included in Exhibit (13),
on page 38 and page 39 in the Registrant's 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders
and is hereby incorporated by reference.

Impact of Change In Segments
In 1993, the Registrant realigned its segments to combine the Broadcasting
and Information and Publication Services segments and Tower Group International
into one segment, Information and Media Services.

The Registrant's segments are:  (1) Information and Media Services, which
includes Broadcasting, all of the company's publications, construction
information products and Tower Group International; (2) Educational and
Professional Publishing, which includes College, professional and legal
publishing and now also includes the Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing
Company.  The Registrant acquired the remaining 50% of the
Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Company from its partner in October
1993 and (3) Financial Services, which includes the Standard & Poor's Ratings
Group and all of the Registrant's Financial Information Services.

                                      -3-





The Registrant's major lease covers space in its headquarters building in New
York City.  The building is owned by Rock-McGraw, Inc., a corporation in which
the Registrant and Rockefeller Group, Inc. are the sole shareholders. The
Registrant occupies approximately 950,000 square feet of the rentable space
under a 30-year lease which includes renewal options for two additional 15-
year periods.  In addition, the Registrant subleases for its own account
approximately 693,000 square feet of space for periods up to 25 years.




                                      -4-


The largest complex owned by the Registrant is located in Highstown, NJ where a
book distribution center and offices for accounting operations, data processing
services, order fulfillment and other service departments are housed.  The
Registrant plans to consolidate its domestic book distribution operations by
centralizing the distribution operations in Blue Ridge Summit, PA and
Hightstown, NJ to Columbus and Blacklick, OH.



Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
While the Registrant and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal
proceedings in the United States and abroad, neither the Registrant nor its
subsidiaries are a party to, nor are any of their properties subject to, any
known material pending legal proceedings which Registrant believes will result
in a material adverse effect on Registrant's financial statements or business
operations.



Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
No matters were submitted to a vote of Registant's security holders during the
last quarter of the period covered by this Report.
