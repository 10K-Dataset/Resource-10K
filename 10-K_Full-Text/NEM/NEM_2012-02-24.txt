NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Introduction

Newmont Mining Corporation is primarily a gold producer with significant operations and/or assets in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia,
Ghana, New Zealand and Mexico. At December 31, 2011, Newmont had attributable proven and probable gold reserves of 98.8 million ounces and an aggregate land position of approximately 31,500 square miles (81,500 square kilometers). Newmont
is also engaged in the production of copper, principally through its Batu Hijau operation in Indonesia and Boddington operation in Australia. Newmont Mining Corporation’s original predecessor corporation was incorporated in 1921 under the laws
of Delaware.

Newmont’s corporate headquarters are in Greenwood Village, Colorado, USA. In this report, “Newmont,” the
“Company,” “our” and “we” refer to Newmont Mining Corporation together with our affiliates and subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. References to “A$” refer to Australian currency,
“C$” to Canadian currency, “NZ$” to New Zealand currency, “IDR” to Indonesian currency and “$” to United States currency.

Newmont’s

Sales

and long-lived assets are geographically distributed as follows:

On April 6, 2011, Newmont acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Fronteer Gold Inc.
(“Fronteer”). Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition, shareholders of Fronteer received C$14.00 in cash and one-fourth of a common share in Pilot Gold Inc., a Canadian corporation, which retained certain exploration assets of Fronteer,
for each common share of Fronteer. Newmont acquired, among other assets, the exploration stage Long Canyon project, which is located approximately one hundred miles from the Company’s existing infrastructure in Nevada and provides the potential
for significant development and operating synergies.

Segment Information, Export Sales, etc.

Our operating segments include North America, South America, Asia Pacific and Africa. Our North America segment consists primarily of Nevada in the
United States, La Herradura in Mexico and Hope Bay in Canada. Our South America segment consists primarily of Yanacocha and Conga in Peru. Our Asia Pacific segment consists primarily of Boddington in Australia, Batu Hijau in Indonesia and other
smaller operations in Australia and New Zealand. Our Africa segment consists primarily of Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, below and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to our operating
segments, domestic and export sales and lack of dependence on a limited number of customers.

Products

References in this report to “attributable gold ounces” or “attributable copper pounds” mean that portion of gold or copper
produced, sold or included in proven and probable reserves based on our ownership and/or economic interest, unless otherwise noted.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Gold

General.

We had consolidated gold production of 5.9 million ounces (5.2 million ounces attributable to Newmont) in 2011, 6.5 million ounces (5.4 million ounces) in 2010 and
6.5 million ounces (5.2 million ounces) in 2009. Of our 2011 consolidated gold production, approximately 33% came from North America, 22% from South America, 35% from Asia Pacific and 10% from Africa.

For 2011, 2010 and 2009, 88%, 81% and 83%, respectively, of our

Sales

were attributable to gold. Most of our

Sales

comes from the sale
of refined gold in the international market. The end product at our gold operations, however, is generally doré bars. Doré is an alloy consisting primarily of gold but also containing silver and other metals. Doré is sent to
refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% gold. Under the terms of our refining agreements, the doré bars are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and the separately-recovered silver is
credited to our account or delivered to buyers. Gold sold from Batu Hijau in Indonesia and a portion of the gold from Boddington in Australia, Phoenix in Nevada and Yanacocha in Peru, is sold in a concentrate containing other metals such as copper
and silver.

Gold Uses.

Gold generally is used for fabrication or investment. Fabricated gold has a
variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry.

Gold Supply.

A combination of current mine production, recycling and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by
governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals make up the annual gold supply. Based on public information available for the years 2008 through 2011, on average, current mine production has accounted for
approximately 64% of the annual gold supply.

Gold Price.

The following table presents the annual high, low
and average daily afternoon fixing prices for gold over the past ten years on the London Bullion Market ($/ounce):

Source: Kitco,
Reuters and the London Bullion Market Association

On February 15, 2012, the afternoon fixing gold price on the London Bullion
Market was $1,733 per ounce and the spot market gold price on the New York Commodity Exchange was $1,726 per ounce.

We generally sell
our gold at the prevailing market price during the month in which the gold is delivered to the customer. We recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable, the gold has been delivered, the title has been transferred and collection of
the sales price is reasonably assured.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Copper

General.

We had consolidated copper production of 352 million pounds (206 million pounds attributable to Newmont) in 2011, 600 million pounds (327 million pounds) in 2010
and 504 million pounds (227 million pounds) in 2009. Copper production is in the form of saleable concentrate that is sold to smelters for further treatment and refining. For 2011, 2010 and 2009, 12%, 19% and 17%, respectively, of our

Sales

were attributable to copper.

Copper Uses.

Refined copper is incorporated into wire and
cable products for use in the construction, electric utility, communications and transportation industries. Copper is also used in industrial equipment and machinery, consumer products and a variety of other electrical and electronic applications
and is also used to make brass. Copper substitutes include aluminum, plastics, stainless steel and fiber optics. Refined, or cathode, copper is also an internationally traded commodity.

Copper Supply.

A combination of current mine production and recycled scrap material make up the annual copper
supply.

Copper Price.

The copper price is quoted on the London Metal Exchange in terms of dollars
per metric ton of high grade copper. The following table presents the dollar per pound equivalent of the annual high, low and average daily prices of high grade copper on the London Metal Exchange over the past ten years ($/pound):

Source: London
Metal Exchange

On February 15, 2012, the high grade copper closing price on the London Metal Exchange was $3.79 per pound.

We generally sell our copper based on the monthly average market price for the third month following the month in which the delivery to
the customer takes place. We recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable, the concentrate has been loaded on a vessel, the title has been transferred and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured. For revenue recognition,
we use a provisional price based on the average prevailing market price during the two week period prior to completion of vessel loading. The copper concentrate is marked to market through earnings as an adjustment to revenue until final settlement.

Gold and Copper Processing Methods

Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either milling or heap leaching, depending on the amount of gold contained in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related capital and operating
costs. Higher grade oxide ores are generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into a fine powder and mixed with water in slurry, which then passes through a carbon-in-leach



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

circuit. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or run-of-mine ore on impermeable pads, where a weak cyanide solution is
applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. In both cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected and pumped to process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or by zinc precipitation.

Gold contained in ores that are not naturally-oxidized can be directly milled if the gold is amenable to cyanidation, generally known as free
milling sulfide ores. Ores that are not amenable to cyanidation, known as refractory ores, require more costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free milling ore. Higher grade refractory ores are processed through either roasters or
autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores.

Some sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant or by bio-milling. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into slurry, then placed
in a tank known as a flotation cell. Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing sulfides to attach to air bubbles and float to the top of the tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into a concentrate that can
then be processed in an autoclave or roaster to recover the gold. Bio-milling incorporates patented technology that involves inoculation of suitable crushed ore on a leach pad with naturally occurring bacteria strains, which oxidize the sulfides
over a period of time. The ore is then processed through an oxide mill.

At Batu Hijau, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a
coarse size at the mine and then transported from the mine via conveyor to a concentrator, where it is finely ground and then treated by successive stages of flotation, resulting in a concentrate containing approximately 26% to 31% copper. The
concentrate is dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for transport to smelters.

At Boddington, ore containing copper and gold is
crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported via conveyor to a process plant, where it is further crushed and then finely ground as a slurry. The ore is initially treated by flotation which produces a copper/gold concentrate containing
approximately 20% copper. Flotation concentrates are processed via a gravity circuit to recover fine liberated gold and then dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for transport to smelters. The flotation tailing has a residual gold content
that is recovered in a carbon-in-leach circuit.

Hedging Activities

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes in gold and copper prices by selling our gold and copper at current market prices
and consequently, we do not hedge our gold and copper sales. We continue to manage certain risks associated with commodity input costs, treasury rates and foreign currencies using the derivative market.

For additional information, see Hedging in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and Note 17 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Gold and Copper Reserves

At December 31, 2011, we had 98.8 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves attributable to Newmont. We added 11.6 million ounces to proven and probable reserves, and depleted
6.3 million ounces during 2011. 2011 reserves were calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,200,



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

A$1,250 or NZ$1,600 per ounce. A reconciliation of the changes in proven and probable gold reserves during the past three years is as follows:

A reconciliation of the changes in proven and probable gold reserves for 2011 by region is as follows:

(1)

The impact of the change in gold price assumption on reserve additions was approximately 3.3 million, 1.7 million and 1.7 million ounces in 2011,
2010 and 2009, respectively. The gold price assumption was $1,200 per ounce in 2011, $950 per ounce in 2010 and $800 per ounce in 2009.

(2)

In 2010, we recognized our attributable interest in Regis Resources Ltd. and their reserves in the Duketon belt of Western Australia for an attributable reserve
of 0.3 million ounces. In 2009, reserves were increased by 6.7 million ounces through the acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in Boddington. At December 31, 2009, our economic interest in Batu Hijau increased to 52.44% as a
result of transactions with a noncontrolling partner, increasing reserves by 1.5 million ounces.

(3)

In April 2010, our direct ownership interest in Batu Hijau decreased from 35.44% to 31.5% (economic interest decreased from 52.44% to 48.50%) as a result of the
divestiture required under the Contract of Work. In November and December 2009, our direct ownership interest in Batu Hijau decreased from 45% to 35.44% as a result of the divestiture required under the Contract of Work. In July 2009 we sold the
Kori Kollo operation in Bolivia.

At December 31, 2011, we had 9,720 million pounds of proven and probable
copper reserves. We added 630 million pounds to proven and probable reserves and depleted 330 million pounds during 2011. 2011 reserves were calculated at a copper price of $3.00 or A$3.15 per pound. A reconciliation of the changes in
proven and probable copper reserves during the past three years is as follows:



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

A reconciliation of changes in proven and probable copper reserves for 2011 by region is as
follows:

(1)

The impact of the change in copper price assumption on reserve additions was 370 million, 150 million and 290 million pounds in 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. The copper price assumption was $3.00 per pound in 2011, $2.50 per pound in 2010 and $2.00 per pound in 2009.

(2)

In 2009, reserves were increased by 640 million pounds through the acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in Boddington. At December 31, 2009,
our economic interest in Batu Hijau increased to 52.44% as a result of transactions with a noncontrolling partner, increasing reserves by 1,400 million pounds.

(3)

In April 2010, our direct ownership interest in Batu Hijau decreased from 35.44% to 31.5% (economic interest decreased from 52.44% to 48.50%) as a result of the
divestiture required under the Contract of Work. In November and December 2009, our direct ownership interest in Batu Hijau decreased from 45% to 35.44% as a result of the divestiture required under the Contract of Work.

Our exploration efforts are directed to the discovery of new mineralized material and converting it into proven and
probable reserves. We conduct near-mine exploration around our existing mines and greenfields exploration in other regions globally. Near-mine exploration can result in the discovery of additional deposits, which may receive the economic benefit of
existing operating, processing, and administrative infrastructures. In contrast, the discovery of mineralization through greenfields exploration efforts will likely require capital investment to build a stand-alone operation. Our

Exploration

expense was $350, $218 and $187 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

For additional information, see Item 2, Properties, Proven
and Probable Reserves.

Licenses and Concessions

Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities, there are no third party patents, licenses or franchises material to our
business. In many countries, however, we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to concessions granted by, or under contract with, the host government. These countries include, among others, Australia, Canada, Ghana, Indonesia,
Mexico, New Zealand, Peru and Suriname. The concessions and contracts are subject to the political risks associated with foreign operations. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, below. For a more detailed description of our Indonesian Contract of Work,
see Item 2, Properties, below.

Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance

Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and
facilities. For more information, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below.

We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against risks that are typical in the operation of our
business, in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. See Item 1A, Risk
Factors, below.

Environmental Matters

Our United States mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Federal Land Policy and Management Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act; and related state laws. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. Our activities outside the United States are also subject to governmental regulations for the
protection of the environment.

We conduct our operations so as to protect public health and the environment and believe our operations
are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Each operating mine has a reclamation plan in place that meets all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2011, $1,070 was accrued for
reclamation costs relating to current or recently producing properties.

We are involved in several matters concerning environmental
obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $170 was
accrued at December 31, 2011 for such obligations associated with properties previously owned or operated by us or our subsidiaries. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at
the time.

For a discussion of the most significant reclamation and remediation activities, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Notes 4 and 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, below.

In addition to legal and regulatory compliance, we have developed complementary programs to guide our company toward achieving transparent and sustainable environmental and socially responsible performance
objectives. Evidencing our management’s commitment towards these objectives, our corporate headquarters are located in an environmentally sustainable, LEED, gold-certified building. We are committed to managing climate change related risks
and responsibly managing our greenhouse gas emissions. We have reported our greenhouse gas emissions annually to the Carbon Disclosure Project since 2004, became a Founding Reporter on The Climate Registry in 2008, and by 2010, established programs
to publically report our independently-verified greenhouse gas emissions for all of our global operations. We actively participate in the International Council on Mining and Metals (“ICMM”) and are committed to the ICMM’s 10
Principles of Sustainable Development and its commitment to implement the UN Global Compact’s 10 principles on human rights, bribery and corruption, labor and the environment. To ensure sound environmental management systems, 100% of
Newmont’s operations have achieved ISO 14001 certification by year-end 2011. We transparently report on our sustainability performance in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines, including the Mining and Metals Sector
Supplement. As a result of our efforts, we continue to achieve milestones, such as being the first gold company listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index World (“DJSI”), remaining a member of the DJSI World Index for five consecutive
years, and receiving International Cyanide Management Code certification at 100% of Newmont operated sites as of the end of 2011.

Employees and Contractors

Approximately 17,100 people were employed by Newmont at December 31, 2011. In addition,
approximately 25,800 people were working as contractors in support of Newmont’s operations.

ITEM 1A.  RISK

FACTORS (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Our business activities are subject to significant risks, including those described below. Every investor or potential investor in our securities
should carefully consider these risks. If any of the described risks actually occurs, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Such risks are not the only ones we face and additional risks
and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

A substantial or extended decline in gold or copper prices would have a material adverse
effect on Newmont.

Our business is dependent on the prices of gold and copper, which fluctuate on a daily basis and are affected
by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors tending to influence prices include:

•

gold sales or leasing by governments and central banks or changes in their monetary policy, including gold inventory management and reallocation of reserves;

•

speculative short positions taken by significant investors or traders in gold or copper;

•

the relative strength of the U.S. dollar;

•

expectations of the future rate of inflation;

•

interest rates;

•

recession or reduced economic activity in the United States, China, India and other industrialized or developing countries;

•

decreased industrial, jewelry or investment demand;

•

increased supply from production, disinvestment and scrap;

•

forward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions; and

•

availability of cheaper substitute materials.

Any decline in our realized gold or copper price adversely impacts our revenues, net income and operating cash flows, particularly in light of our strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions with respect to
gold or copper. We have recorded asset write-downs in the past and may experience additional write-downs as a result of lower gold or copper prices in the future.

In addition, sustained lower gold or copper prices can:

•

reduce revenues further through production declines due to cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits, that have become uneconomic at
prevailing gold or copper prices;

•

reduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore stockpiles and ore on leach pads;

•

halt or delay the development of new projects;

•

reduce funds available for exploration with the result that depleted reserves may not be replaced; and

•

reduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices.

Also see the discussion in Item 1, Business, Gold or Copper Price.

We may be unable to replace gold and copper reserves as they become depleted.

Gold and
copper producers must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including by expanding known ore
bodies, by locating new deposits, or by acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and frequently is unproductive. Our current or future exploration programs may not result in
new mineral producing operations. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may
change.

We may consider, from time to time, the acquisition of ore reserves related to development properties and operating mines. Such
acquisitions are typically based on an analysis of a variety of factors including historical operating results, estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of ore reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash and other
operating costs. Other factors that affect our decision to make any such acquisitions may also include our assumptions for



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

future gold or copper prices or other mineral prices and the projected economic returns and evaluations of existing or potential liabilities associated with the property and its operations and
projections of how these may change in the future. In addition, in connection with future acquisitions we may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties and which may contain information or data that we are unable to independently verify or
confirm. Other than historical operating results, all of these factors are uncertain and may have an impact on our revenue, our cash and other operating issues, as well as contributing to the uncertainties related to the process used to estimate ore
reserves. In addition, there may be intense competition for the acquisition of attractive mining properties.

As a result of these
uncertainties, our exploration programs and any acquisitions which we may pursue may not result in the expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.

Estimates of proven and probable reserves and non reserve
mineralization are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates.

The reserves stated
in this report represent the amount of gold and copper that we estimated, at December 31, 2011, could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Estimates of proven and probable reserves are
subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, to a large extent, based on the prices of gold and copper and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques. Producers use feasibility studies to
derive estimates of capital and operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, the costs of comparable
facilities, the costs of operating and processing equipment and other factors. Actual operating costs and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from original estimates. Further, it may take many years from the initial phases of
exploration until commencement of production, during which time, the economic feasibility of production may change.

In addition, if the
price of gold or copper declines from recent levels, if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, we can offer no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will be realized
or that mineral reserves as currently reported can be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain of our ore reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported reserves. Consequently,
if our actual mineral reserves and resources are less than current estimates, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position may be materially impaired.

Increased operating costs could affect our profitability.

Costs at any particular
mining location are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body. In addition, costs are affected by the
price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations
less profitable. Further, changes in laws and regulations can affect commodity prices, uses and transport. Reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a
significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow.

We could have significant increases in capital and operating costs over
the next several years in connection with the development of new projects in challenging jurisdictions and in sustaining existing operations. Costs associated with capital expenditures have escalated on an industry-wide basis over the last several
years, as a result of factors beyond our control, including the prices of oil, steel and



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

other commodities and labor. Increased costs for capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the profitability of existing operations and economic returns anticipated from new projects.

Estimates relating to new development projects are uncertain and we may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than
estimated.

Mine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development
phase before production is possible. Such projects could experience unexpected problems and delays during development, construction and mine start-up.

Our decision to develop a project is typically based on the results of feasibility studies, which estimate the anticipated economic returns of a project. The actual project profitability or economic feasibility may
differ from such estimates as a result of any of the following factors, among others:

•

changes in tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of ore to be mined and processed;

•

higher input commodity and labor costs;

•

the quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made;

•

adverse geotechnical conditions;

•

availability of adequate and skilled labor force and supply and cost of water and power;

•

fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates;

•

availability and terms of financing;

•

delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project
development;

•

changes in tax laws;

•

weather or severe climate impacts; and

•

potential delays relating to social and community issues, including, without limitation, issues resulting in protests, road blockages or work stoppages.

Our future development activities may not result in the expansion or replacement of current production with new
production, or one or more of these new production sites or facilities may be less profitable than currently anticipated or may not be profitable at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
position.

We may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining.

The exploration for natural resources and the development and production of mining operations are activities that involve a high
level of uncertainty. These can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:

•

environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, pollutants or hazardous chemicals;

•

industrial accidents, including in connection with the operation of mining transportation equipment and accidents associated with the preparation and ignition of
large-scale blasting operations, milling equipment and conveyor systems;

•

underground fires or floods;

•

unexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form);

•

ground and water conditions;

•

fall-of-ground accidents in underground operations;

•

failure of mining pit slopes and tailings dam walls;

•

seismic activity; and

•

other natural phenomena, such as lightning, cyclonic or tropical storms, floods or other inclement weather conditions.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

The occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities and
development and production of mining operations may result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production
facilities, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial
position.

Shortages of critical parts and equipment may adversely affect our operations and development projects.

The mining industry has been impacted by increased demand for critical resources such as input commodities, drilling equipment
and tires. These shortages have, at times, impacted the efficiency of our operations, and resulted in cost increases and delays in construction of projects; thereby impacting operating costs, capital expenditures and production and construction
schedules.

Mining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which
they operate, and are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.

As a result of public concern
about the real or perceived detrimental effects of economic globalization and global climate impacts, businesses generally and large multinational corporations in natural resources industries, such as Newmont, in particular, face increasing public
scrutiny of their activities. These businesses are under pressure to demonstrate that, as they seek to generate satisfactory returns on investment to shareholders, other stakeholders, including employees, governments, communities surrounding
operations and the countries in which they operate, benefit and will continue to benefit from their commercial activities. Such pressures tend to be particularly focused on companies whose activities are perceived to have a high impact on their
social and physical environment. The potential consequences of these pressures include reputational damage, legal suits and social investment obligations.

In addition, our ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop and operate mines and to successfully operate in communities around the world will likely depend on our ability to
develop, operate and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. Our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to
successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in
which we operate. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain government permits and approvals may adversely affect our operations, including our ability to explore or develop properties, commence production or continue operations. Key permits and
approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be varied in a manner that adversely affects our operations, including our ability to explore or develop properties, commence production or continue operations.

Our exploration, development, mining and processing operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing worker health and safety and
land use and the protection of the environment, which generally apply to air and water quality, protection of endangered, protected or other specified species, hazardous waste management and reclamation. Some of the countries in which we operate
have implemented, and are developing, laws and regulations related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. We have made, and expect to make in the future, significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Compliance with
these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and burdens, and can cause delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, government permits and approvals which may adversely impact our closure processes and operations.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Future changes in applicable laws, regulations, permits and approvals or changes in their
enforcement or regulatory interpretation could substantially increase costs to achieve compliance, lead to the revocation of existing or future exploration or mining rights or otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations and
financial position. For instance, the operation of our mines in the United States is subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine
Act”). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. If such inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines, penalties or
sanctions and our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Over the past several years MSHA has significantly increased the numbers
of citations and orders charged against mining operations and increased the dollar penalties assessed for citations issued.

In addition,
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is currently seeking to regulate as hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) process solution streams derived from core beneficiation
operations, such as our roasting operations, in Nevada. Historically, such streams have been considered exempt from RCRA and have been regulated by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. The regulation of these streams as hazardous waste
under RCRA could subject us to civil and criminal penalties for past practices and require us to incur substantial future costs to modify our waste water collection systems and retrofit our tailings storage facilities at our Nevada mining
operations, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Increased global attention or
regulation on water quality discharge, such as recently enacted water quality legislation applicable to our operations in Peru, and on restricting or prohibiting the use of cyanide and other hazardous substances in processing activities could
similarly have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position due to increased compliance and input costs.

We
have implemented a management system designed to promote continuous improvement in health and safety, environmental performance and community relations. However, our ability to operate, and thus, our results of operations and our financial position,
could be adversely affected by accidents or events detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the health and safety of our employees, the environment or the communities in which we operate.

Mine closure and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made.

Natural resource companies are required to close their operations and rehabilitate the lands that they mine in accordance with a variety of
environmental laws and regulations. Estimates of the total ultimate closure and rehabilitation costs for gold and copper mining operations are significant and based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements and mine closure plans that
may change materially. For example, we have conducted extensive remediation work at two inactive sites in the United States. We are conducting remediation activities at a third site in the United States, an inactive uranium mine and mill site
formerly operated by a subsidiary of Newmont.

Any underestimated or unanticipated rehabilitation costs could materially affect our
financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Environmental liabilities are accrued when they become known, are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes known, or a
previously estimated reclamation cost is increased, the amount of that liability and additional cost will be recorded at that time and could materially reduce our consolidated net income attributable to Newmont stockholders in the related period. In
addition, regulators are increasingly requesting security in the form of cash collateral, credit, trust arrangements or guarantees to secure the performance of environmental obligations, which could have an adverse



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

effect on our financial position. For a more detailed discussion of potential environmental liabilities, see the discussion in Environmental Matters, Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The laws and regulations governing mine closure and remediation in a particular jurisdiction are subject to review at any
time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental liabilities to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations.

Regulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs which could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

Producing gold is an energy-intensive business, resulting in a significant carbon
footprint. Energy costs account for about a quarter of our overall operating costs, with our principal energy sources being purchased electricity, diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas and coal.

A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of
climate change that are viewed as the result of emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels. The December 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which ends in 2012, established a set of greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for developed countries that
have ratified the Protocol, which include Australia and New Zealand. The United States signed but never ratified the Protocol and Canada recently pulled out of the Protocol. Ghana, Indonesia, and Peru ratified the Protocol but as developing
countries are not subject to greenhouse gas emission reductions. The Conference of Parties 15 (“COP15”) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Copenhagen, Denmark in December 2009 was to determine the path
forward after the Kyoto Protocol ends. COP15 resulted in the Copenhagen Accord (the “Accord”), a non-binding document calling for economy-wide emissions targets for 2020. Prior to the January 31, 2010 deadline, the United States,
Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Ghana and Peru re-affirmed their commitment to the Accord.

Some of the countries in which we operate
have implemented, and are developing, laws and regulations related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. In December 2009, the EPA issued an endangerment finding under the U.S. Clean Air Act that current and projected concentrations of
certain mixed greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare. Regulations have been adopted and additional laws or regulations may be promulgated in the United States to address the concerns
raised by such endangerment finding. To date, U.S. regulations do not impose carbon tax on our operations but may in the future. Australia passed the Clean Energy Act in 2011 that sets up a mechanism to combat climate change by imposing a
“carbon tax” on greenhouse gas emissions and encourages investment in clean energy. The legislation takes effect on July 1, 2012 and will have an impact to our Australian operations of $30 - $40 million annually.

Non-governmental climate change requirements are beginning to be implemented. For example, Hope Bay is required to comply with the Mining
Association of Canada’s Toward Sustainable Mining initiative to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and Conga is required to comply with International Finance Corporation Performance Standards to report and reduce greenhouse
gas emissions. This is a trend that is likely to continue.

Legislation and increased regulation and requirements regarding climate
change could impose increased costs on us, our venture partners and our suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. Until the timing, scope and
extent of any future requirements becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition, financial position, results of operations and ability to compete.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would
be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures. These impacts may adversely impact
the cost, production and financial performance of our operations.

Our operations are subject to risks of doing business.

Exploration, development, production and mine closure activities are subject to regional, political, economic, community and
other risks of doing business, including:

•

disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to the rigorous laws and regulations of the U.S. or other jurisdictions,
including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act;

•

changes in laws or regulations;

•

royalty and tax increases or claims, including retroactive increases and claims and requests to renegotiate terms of existing royalties and taxes, by
governmental entities, including such increases, claims and/or requests by the governments of Ghana, Indonesia, Australia, Peru, the United States and the State of Nevada;

•

increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a
particular operation is located;

•

delays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, necessary governmental permits and approvals;

•

claims for increased mineral royalties or ownership interests by local or indigenous communities;

•

expropriation or nationalization of property;

•

currency fluctuations, particularly in countries with high inflation;

•

foreign exchange controls;

•

restrictions on the ability of local operating companies to sell gold offshore for U.S. dollars, or on the ability of such companies to hold U.S. dollars or
other foreign currencies in offshore bank accounts;

•

import and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold;

•

increases in costs relating to, or restrictions or prohibitions on, the use of ports for concentrate storage and shipping, such as in relation to our Boddington
and Batu Hijau operations where use of alternative ports is not currently economically feasible or in relation to our ability to procure economically feasible ports for developing projects;

•

restrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore or to otherwise repatriate funds;

•

risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;

•

risk of loss due to criminal activities such as trespass, illegal mining, theft and vandalism;

•

risk of loss due to disease and other potential endemic health issues;

•

disadvantages relating to submission to the jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitration panels or enforcement or appeals of judgments at foreign courts or
arbitration panels against a sovereign nation within its own territory; and

•

other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, including risks inherent in contracts with government owned
entities such as unilateral cancellation or renegotiation of contracts, licenses or other mining rights.

Consequently,
our exploration, development and production activities may be affected by these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, some of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Our Batu Hijau operation in Indonesia is subject to political and economic risks.

We have a substantial investment in Indonesia, a nation that since 1997 has undergone financial crises and devaluation of its
currency, outbreaks of political and religious violence and acts of terrorism, changes in national leadership, devolution of authority to regional governments, and the secession of East Timor, one of its former provinces. These factors heighten the
risk of abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors, which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts, increased taxation and royalties (at both the national and regional level), denial of permits
or permit renewals or expropriation of assets. In regard to issues of resource nationalism, certain government officials and members of parliament may have a preference for national mining companies to own Indonesia’s mineral assets and the
government has advocated policies intended to result in development of additional in-country processing of minerals mined in Indonesia and restrictions on exportation including the smelting and exportation of copper concentrates.

Violence committed by radical elements in Indonesia and other countries and the presence of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, as well as U.S.
involvement in other conflicts in the Middle East, may increase the risk that operations owned by U.S. companies will be the target of violence. If our Batu Hijau operation were so targeted it could have an adverse effect on our business.

Our Batu Hijau operation faced demonstrations by the local community in 2011 relating to a worker recruitment process, including
protests and roadblocks. We cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur and the recurrence of significant opposition from the local community could disrupt mining activities and, thereby, adversely affect Batu
Hijau’s assets and operations. Batu Hijau also faced a temporary work stoppage in 2011 arising from a dispute regarding overtime pay, and the operation’s collective bargaining agreement with the workforce is subject to renewal later this
year. Indonesia has seen greater worker and union activism in recent times, and a strike or protracted labor agreement negotiation could adversely affect Batu Hijau’s operations.

Over the years, we are required to apply for renewals of certain key permits related to Batu Hijau. PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”),
the entity operating Batu Hijau, employs a submarine tailings placement (“STP”) system. The STP system is operated pursuant to a permit from the government of Indonesia that was renewed in 2011, but is subject to challenge in connection
with certain legal proceedings. See Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of pending litigation. A loss of the STP permit would be expected to adversely impact Batu Hijau operations and may adversely impact
our future operating and financial results.

Our ownership interest in Batu Hijau has been reduced in accordance with the Contract
of Work issued by the Indonesian Government and future reductions in our interest in PTNNT may result in our loss of control over the Batu Hijau operations.

We currently have a 31.5% direct ownership interest in PTNNT, held through Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V. (“NTPBV”), which is owned with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan
(“Sumitomo”). We have a 56.25% interest in NTPBV and a Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTPBV in turn owns 56% of PTNNT, the Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. In December 2009, Newmont entered into a transaction
with P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an unrelated non-controlling shareholder in PTNNT, whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTPI in exchange for (i) a pledge of PTPI’s 20% shareholding in PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of
dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax, (iii) a commitment to support the application of our standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine, and (iv) as of September 16, 2011, powers of attorney to vote and sell
the PTNNT shares in support of the pledge, enforceable in an event of default as further security for the funding. On June 25, 2010, to effectuate PTPI’s desire to sell the shares, PTPI completed the sale of approximately a 2.2% interest
in PTNNT to PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama (“PTIMI”), and Newmont entered into a transaction with PTIMI whereby we agreed to



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

advance certain funds to PTIMI in exchange for (i) a pledge of PTIMI’s 2.2% shareholding in PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax,
and (iii) a commitment to support the application of our standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine. Under the terms of the transaction, the Company has no powers of attorney or other right to vote PTIMI’s shares. Based on the above
transactions, Newmont recognizes an additional 17% effective economic interest in PTNNT. Combined with Newmont’s 56.25% ownership in NTPBV, Newmont has a 48.5% effective economic interest in PTNNT and continues to consolidate Batu Hijau in its
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Under the Contract of Work executed in 1986 between the Indonesian government and PTNNT (the
“Contract of Work”), 51% of PTNNT’s shares were required to be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or, second, to Indonesian nationals by March 31, 2010. On May 6, 2011 we announced that a definitive
agreement was signed with an agency of the Indonesian Government’s Ministry of Finance for the sale of the final 7% divestiture stake in PTNNT. Subsequently, a dispute over the legality of the purchase under relevant laws and regulations has
arisen between certain members of parliament and the Ministry of Finance, and the transaction has not yet closed. Upon closing of the transaction, our ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine’s production, assets and proven and probable equity
reserves will be reduced to a 27.56% direct ownership interest as NTPBV’s ownership interest in PTNNT will be reduced to 49%, thus potentially reducing our ability to control the operation at Batu Hijau. In addition, we will have a 17%
effective economic interest in PTNNT following the closing of the transaction through financing arrangements with existing shareholders, and we have identified Variable Interest Entities in connection with our economic interests in PTNNT due to
certain funding arrangements and shareholder commitments. Therefore, we expect to continue to consolidate PTNNT in our Consolidated Financial Statements after the final 7% sale is completed. Loss of control over PTNNT operations may result in our
deconsolidation of PTNNT for accounting purposes, which would reduce our reported consolidated sales, total assets and operating cash flows. See Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the PTNNT share divestiture.

As part of the negotiation of the divestiture share sale agreements with PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”), the nominee of
the local governments, the parties executed an operating agreement (the “Operating Agreement”), under which each recognizes the rights of Newmont and Sumitomo to apply their operating standards to the management of PTNNT’s operations,
including standards for safety, environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The Operating Agreement became effective in February 2010 and will continue for so long as Newmont and Sumitomo collectively own more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB.
If the Operating Agreement terminates, then Newmont may lose control over the applicable operating standards for Batu Hijau and will be at risk for operations conducted in a manner that either detracts from value or results in safety, environmental
or social standards below those adhered to by Newmont and Sumitomo.

The Contract of Work has been and may continue to be the
subject of dispute, legal review, or requests for renegotiation by the Indonesian government, and is subject to termination by the Indonesian government if we do not comply with our obligations, which would result in the loss of all or much of the
value of Batu Hijau.

The divestiture provisions of the Contract of Work have been the subject of dispute. In 2008, the Ministry
of Energy and Mineral Resources of the Indonesian government (the “MEMR”) alleged that PTNNT was in breach of its divestiture requirements under the Contract of Work and threatened to terminate the Contract of Work if PTNNT did not agree
to divest shares in accordance with the direction of the MEMR. The matter was resolved by an international arbitration panel in March 2009. The arbitration decision led to NTPBV divesting 24% of PTNNT’s shares to PTMDB, the party nominated by
the MEMR.

Although the Indonesian government has acknowledged that PTNNT is currently in compliance with the Contract of Work, future
disputes may arise under the Contract of Work. Moreover, there have



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

been statements, from time to time, by some within the Indonesian government who advocate elimination of Contracts of Work and who may try to instigate future disputes surrounding the Contract of
Work, particularly given that Batu Hijau is one of the largest businesses within the country. Although any dispute under the Contract of Work is subject to international arbitration, there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any such
dispute and any termination of the Contract of Work could result in substantial diminution in the value of our interests in PTNNT. See Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the disputes involving the Contract of
Work.

In January 2009, the Indonesian Government passed a new mining law. While the law preserves the right of PTNNT to operate our Batu
Hijau operations pursuant to the Contract of Work, the Indonesian government is seeking to renegotiate certain provisions of the Contract of Work to conform to certain provisions of the new mining law, which could include requests for, among other
things, higher royalty rates. In January 2012, the President of Indonesia appointed a committee to evaluate the process of conforming Contracts of Work to the 2009 mining law.

Our operations at Yanacocha and the development of our Conga Project in Peru are subject to political and social unrest risks, which have resulted most recently in the suspension of construction activities in
our Conga project.

During the last several years, Minera
Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”), in which we own a 51.35% interest, and whose properties include the mining operations at Yanacocha and the Conga project in Peru, has been the target of local political and community protests, some of which
blocked the road between the Yanacocha mine and Conga project complexes and the City of Cajamarca in Peru and resulted in vandalism and equipment damage. We cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur in the future. The
recurrence of significant political or community opposition or protests could adversely affect Conga’s development and the continued operation of Yanacocha.

Most recently, construction activities on our Conga project were suspended on November 30, 2011 at the request of Peru’s central government following increasing protests in Cajamarca by anti-mining
activists led by the regional president. At the request of the Peruvian central government, the environmental impact assessment prepared in connection with the project, which was previously approved by the central government in October 2010,
will be reviewed by independent experts, in an effort to resolve allegations around the environmental viability of Conga. Construction will remain suspended for the duration of the review or longer, except for sediment control works that are
being conducted in the project area. However, progress continues on engineering and procurement work. Should the Company be unable to continue with the current development plan at Conga, the Company may in the future reprioritize and reallocate
capital to development alternatives in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia, which may result in a potential impairment of the Conga project.

In the second quarter of 2011, Presidential and Congressional elections resulted in a change in government in Peru. While the new government has ratified its intention to support mining as a driver for continued
growth and future development of Peru, we are unable to predict the positions that will be taken by the new administration or new laws that will be passed by the recently elected Congress, whether the regional government of Cajamarca will support or
oppose such positions or laws, or how any change in such position or law will affect Yanacocha or Conga. Such changes may include increased labor regulations, environmental and other regulatory requirements, and additional taxes and royalties. For
example, during the third quarter of 2011, the new government enacted four new tax laws. We cannot predict future positions of either the Central or regional government on foreign investment, mining concessions, land tenure or other regulation. Any
change in government positions or laws on these issues could adversely affect the assets and operations of Yanacocha or Conga, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, any
inability to continue to develop the Conga project or operate at Yanacocha could have an adverse impact on our growth if we are not able to replace its expected production.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Our Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges, which
could adversely impact our production and profitability.

Newmont and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical
challenges due to the older age of certain of our mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. This leads to higher pit walls, more complex underground environments and increased exposure to geotechnical instability and
hydrological impacts. As our operations are maturing, the open pits at many of our sites are getting deeper and we have experienced certain geotechnical failures at some of our mines, including, without limitation, in Indonesia at the Batu Hijau
open-pit mine and at our operations in Nevada and Peru.

No assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse geotechnical and
hydrological conditions, such as landslides and pit wall failures, will not occur in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards
outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material.

Geotechnical failures could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, increased
monitoring costs, remediation costs, loss of ore and other impacts, which could cause one or more of our projects to be less profitable than currently anticipated and could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial position.

Currency fluctuations may affect our costs.

Currency fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur at our operations. Gold and copper is sold throughout the world based principally on the
U.S. dollar price, but a portion of our operating expenses are incurred in local currencies. The appreciation of those local currencies against the U.S. dollar increases our costs of production in U.S. dollar terms at mines located outside the
United States.

The foreign currency that primarily impacts our results of operations is the Australian dollar. We estimate that every
$0.10 increase in the U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rate increases annually the U.S. dollar

Costs applicable to sales

by approximately $90 for each ounce of gold sold from operations in Australia before taking into account the impact
of currency hedging. During the majority of 2011, the Australian dollar was relatively stronger than the U.S. dollar compared to 2010. The annual average Australia dollar exchange rate appreciated by approximately 12% from 2010 to 2011. We hedge up
to 90% of our future forecasted Australian dollar denominated operating expenditures to reduce the variability of our Australian dollar exposure. At December 31, 2011 we have hedged 76%, 62%, 46%, 26% and 10% of our forecasted Australian
denominated operating costs in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Our Australian dollar derivative programs will limit the benefit to Newmont of future decreases, if any, in the U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rates. For
additional information, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, below. For a more detailed
description of how currency exchange rates may affect costs, see discussion in Foreign Currency in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions About Market Risk.

Our business requires substantial capital investment and we may be unable to raise additional funding on favorable terms.

The construction and operation of potential future projects including the Akyem project in Ghana, the Conga project in Peru and various exploration projects will require significant funding. Our operating cash flow
and other sources of funding may become insufficient to meet all of these requirements, depending on the timing and costs of development of these and other projects. As a result, new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding requirements
of these investments,



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper
prices, our operational performance and our current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or a further dislocation in the financial markets as
experienced in recent years, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing operations, retire or service all of our outstanding debt and pay dividends could be significantly constrained.

Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could increase our future borrowing costs and adversely
affect the availability of new financing.

There can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard &
Poor’s Rating Services or Moody’s Investors Service to Newmont will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of
the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects deteriorate, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies,
which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities, our existing debt and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, and increase our borrowing costs, which in turn could impair our results of operations and
financial position.

To the extent that we seek to expand our operations and increase our reserves through acquisitions, we may
experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations.

From time to time, we examine opportunities to
make selective acquisitions in order to expand our operations and reported reserves. The success of any acquisition would depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:

•

identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms;

•

obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially Newmont’s shareholders;

•

maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business;

•

implementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the
acquired business; and

•

to the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in
that new jurisdiction.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully, or
that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial position.

Our operations may be adversely affected by energy shortages.

Our mining operations and development projects require significant amounts of energy. Our principal energy sources are electricity, purchased
petroleum products, natural gas and coal. Some of our operations are in remote locations requiring long distance transmission of power, and in some locations we compete with other companies for access to third party power generators or electrical
supply networks. A disruption in the transmission of energy, inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

We have periodically experienced power shortages in Ghana resulting primarily from drought,
increasing demands for electricity and insufficient hydroelectric or other generating capacity which caused curtailment of production at our Ahafo operations. As a result of the mining industry’s agreement to construct and install an 80
mega-watt power plant during 2007, the Ghanaian government has agreed, if required, to curtail power consumption as a result of power shortages and to distribute available power proportionately between participating mines and other industrial and
commercial users. The need to use alternative sources of power may result in higher than anticipated costs, which will affect operating costs. Continued power shortages and increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations and financial
position.

Continuation of our mining production is dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies to support our
mining operations.

Our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support
facilities. Our operations in North and South America and Australia are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to
maintain our water rights and claims and defeat claims adverse to our current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of our operations currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the
potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to our water rights, claims and uses. The loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to
curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could limit our access to sufficient water resources in our
operations, thus adversely affecting our operations.

We are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to
disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.

We are dependent upon information
technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber attacks,
natural disasters and defects in design. Damage, disruption, or failure of one or more information technology systems may result in interruptions to our operations in the interim or may require a significant investment to fix or replace them.
Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to the information technology systems and network disruptions, but our business, financial position or results of our operations could be adversely impacted by such interruptions or
such investments.

We could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems
are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. We have begun the implementation of new enterprise software that we will use for various operational functions, financial reporting and controls management.
The implementation of this new system carries risks such as cost overruns, delays and interruptions. If we are not able to successfully implement our new system in a timely manner, we will have to rely on manual reporting processes and controls
over financial reporting that have not been planned, designed or tested. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to the system implementation, but system implementation failures could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

The occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flow and overall
profitability.

We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against certain risks related to our operations. This insurance is
maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable depending upon the circumstances surrounding each identified risk. However, we may elect not to have insurance for certain risks because of the high premiums associated with insuring those risks
or for various other reasons; in other cases, insurance may not be available for certain risks. Some concern always exists with respect to investments in parts of the world where civil unrest, war, nationalist movements, political violence or
economic crises are possible. These countries may also pose heightened risks of expropriation of assets, business interruption, increased taxation or unilateral modification of concessions and contracts. We do not maintain insurance policies against
political risk. Occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our results of operations and financial position.

Our business depends on good relations with our employees.

Production at our mines is dependent upon the efforts of our employees and, consequently, our maintenance of good relationships with our employees. Due to union activities or other employee actions, we could
experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect us. At December 31, 2011, union represented employees constituted approximately 42% of our worldwide work force. There can be no assurance
that any future disputes will be resolved without disruptions to operations.

We rely on contractors to conduct a significant
portion of our operations and construction projects.

A significant portion of our operations and construction projects are
currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:

•

negotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;

•

the inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;

•

reduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;

•

failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;

•

interruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;

•

failure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and

•

problems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues.

In addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these risks
could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.

We are subject to litigation and may be subject to
additional litigation in the future.

We are currently, or may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other
legal proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to Newmont, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more
detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a
prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Title to some of our properties may be defective or challenged.

Although we have conducted title reviews of our properties, title review does not preclude third parties from challenging our title or related
property rights. While we believe that we have satisfactory title to our properties, some titles may be defective or subject to challenge. In addition, certain of our Australian properties could be subject to native title or traditional landowner
claims, and our ability to use these properties is dependent on agreements with traditional owners of the properties. For information regarding native title or traditional landowner claims, see the discussion under the Australia/New Zealand section
of Item 2, Properties, below.

Competition from other natural resource companies may harm our business.

We compete with other natural resource companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We also
compete with other natural resource companies for specialized equipment, components and supplies, such as drill rigs, necessary for exploration and development, as well as for rights to mine properties containing gold, copper and other minerals. We
may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, to obtain the services of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or supplies, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties.

Our ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income.

We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being
realized, otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of
future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to
realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2011, the Company’s current and
long-term deferred tax assets were $396 and $1,605, respectively.

Returns for investments in pension plans are uncertain.

We maintain pension plans for certain employees which provide for specified payments after retirement. The ability of the
pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the plans. Returns, if any, on investments are subject to fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions. A
sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated. During the second half of 2008 and early 2009, market conditions caused the value of the investments in our
pension plans to decrease significantly. As a result, we contributed $27 and $161 to the pension plans in 2011 and 2010, respectively. If future plan investment returns are not sufficient, we may be required to increase the amount of future cash
contributions. For a more detailed discussion of the funding status and expected benefit payments to plan participants, see the discussion in Employee Related Benefits, Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends on the common stock.

Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds
legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no
surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less
than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Furthermore, holders of our common stock may be subject to the prior dividend rights of holders of our preferred stock or
depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants and financial ratios
related to existing or future indebtedness. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock and recently adopted the enhanced gold price-linked dividend policy described under Item 5, Market for Registrant’s
Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities, we are not required to declare cash dividends on our common stock and our board of directors may reduce, defer or eliminate our common stock dividend in the
future.

Production and Development Properties

Newmont’s significant production and development properties are described below. Operating statistics for each operation are presented in a
table in the next section of Item 2.

North America

Nevada, USA.

We have been mining gold in Nevada since 1965. Nevada operations include Carlin, located west of the city
of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend, the Phoenix mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles north of Golconda, and the Midas mine near the town of the same name. We
also participate in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”), which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks.

Gold production from Nevada was approximately 1.7 million ounces for 2011 with ore mined from seven open pit and eight underground mines. At December 31, 2011, we reported 34.7 million ounces



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

of gold reserves in Nevada, with 77% of those ounces in open pit mines and 23% in underground mines. We are advancing several development opportunities in Nevada, including Long Canyon, with
significant reserve expansion potential.

The Nevada operations produce gold from a variety of ore types requiring different processing
techniques depending on economic and metallurgical characteristics. To ensure the best use of processing capacity, we use a linear programming model to guide the flow of both mining sequence selection and routing of ore streams to various plants.
Refractory ores, which require more complex, higher cost processing methods, generated 79% of Nevada’s gold production in 2011, compared with 79% in 2010 and 77% in 2009. With respect to remaining reserves, we estimate that approximately 85%
are refractory ores and 15% are oxide ores. Higher-grade oxide ores are processed by conventional milling and cyanide leaching at Carlin (Mill 5) and Twin Creeks (Juniper). Lower-grade material with suitable cyanide solubility is treated on heap
leach pads at Carlin and Twin Creeks. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through either a roaster at Carlin (Mill 6) or autoclaves at Twin Creeks (Sage). Lower-grade refractory ores are processed at Carlin by flotation or direct flotation at
Mill 5. Mill 5 flotation concentrates are then processed at the Carlin roaster or the Twin Creeks autoclaves and additional gold is recovered from the flotation tails by cyanide leaching. The Phoenix mill produces a gravity gold concentrate and a
copper/gold flotation concentrate and recovers additional gold from cyanide leaching of the flotation tails. Ore from the Midas mine is processed by conventional milling and Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation. Activated carbon from the various
leaching circuits is treated to produce gold ore at the Carlin or Twin Creeks refineries. Zinc precipitate at Midas is refined on-site.

We own, or control through long-term mining leases and unpatented mining claims, all of the minerals and surface area within the boundaries of the
present Nevada mining operations (except for the Turquoise Ridge joint venture described below). The long-term leases extend for at least the anticipated mine life of those deposits. With respect to a significant portion of the Gold Quarry mine at
Carlin, we pay a royalty equivalent to 16.2% of the mineral production. We wholly-own or control the remainder of the Gold Quarry mineral rights, in some cases subject to additional royalties. With respect to certain smaller deposits in Nevada, we
are obligated to pay royalties on production to third parties that vary from 1% to 8% of production.

In Nevada, mining taxes are
assessed on up to 5% of net proceeds of a mine. Net proceeds are calculated as the excess of gross yield over direct costs. Gross yield is determined as the value received when minerals are sold, exchanged for anything of value or removed from the
state. Direct costs generally include the costs to develop, extract, produce, transport and refine minerals.

We have a 25% interest in a
joint venture with Barrick in the Turquoise Ridge mine. Newmont has an agreement to provide up to 2,000 tons per day of milling capacity at Twin Creeks to the joint venture. Barrick is the operator of the joint venture. Gold production of 44,000
ounces in 2011, 38,000 ounces in 2010 and 39,000 ounces in 2009 were attributable to Newmont, based on our 25% ownership interest.

We
had ore sale agreements with Yukon-Nevada Gold Corporation (“Yukon-Nevada”) and Barrick to process the Company’s ore. We recognized attributable gold sales, net of treatment charges, of 47,000 ounces in 2011, 15,000 ounces in 2010 and
700 ounces in 2009, pursuant to these agreements.

On April 6, 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of Fronteer Gold Inc.
(“Fronteer”). Fronteer owned among other assets, the exploration stage Long Canyon project, which is located approximately one hundred miles from the Company’s existing infrastructure in Nevada and we believe provides the potential
for significant development and operating synergies. During 2011, the project entered into the pre-feasibility stage as we further develop our understanding of what we expect could be another Carlin-type trend at Long Canyon. We have received an
expanded exploration area permit



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

allowing access to project targets. We continue to make progress on the drilling program. A total of 72 kilometers of drilling was completed in 2011 and we anticipate an additional 65 kilometers
to be drilled in 2012. Our intention is to bring the project into production in 2017 with initial estimated gold production of approximately 200,000 to 300,000 ounces per year.

Mexico.

We have a 44% interest in the La Herradura joint venture and related gold properties (Herradura, Soledad-Dipolos and Noche Buena), which are located in Mexico’s Sonora
desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises open pit operations with run-of-mine heap leach processing. Herradura, located in Sonara, Mexico has been in operation since 1998.
Soledad-Dipolos is located 9 kilometers northwest of Herradura and commenced operations in January, 2010. Noche Buena is located 23 kilometers northwest of Herradura and operations are expected to commence in the first half of 2012. La Herradura
produced 212,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2011, and at December 31, 2011 we reported 2.3 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.

South America

The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“MYSRL”) include the
mining operations at Yanacocha and the Conga project. We hold a 51.35% interest in MYSRL with the remaining interests held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”) (43.65%) and the International Finance
Corporation (5%).

MYSRL has mining rights with respect to a large land position consisting of concessions granted by the Peruvian
government to MYSRL and a related entity. These mining concessions provide for both the right to explore and exploit. However, MYSRL must first obtain the respective exploration and exploitation permits, which are generally granted in due course.
MYSRL may retain mining concessions indefinitely by paying annual fees and, during exploitation, complying with production obligations or paying assessed fines. Mining concessions are freely assignable or transferable. During 2011, Peru enacted a
new mining tax and royalty regime, replacing a 3.75% voluntary contribution that expired in 2010. Beginning October 1, 2011, mining companies are subject to a revised royalty and special mining tax, dependent on whether or not a stabilization
agreement is in effect. The revised royalty and special mining taxes are based on a sliding scale and are expected to be 5% to 7%.

Yanacocha, Peru.

Yanacocha is located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48
kilometers) north of the city of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993 and currently has active open pit mines at Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha, and in 2011, mining operations were reinitiated at Maqui Maqui and
Carachugo. Yanacocha has four leach pads, three processing facilities, and one mill, which began commercial production in the second quarter of 2008. Yanacocha’s gold production for 2011 was 1.3 million ounces (728,000 attributable ounces)
and at December 31, 2011 we reported 4.0 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.

Conga,
Peru.

The Conga project is located within close proximity of existing operations at Yanacocha. In July 2011, the project progressed infrastructure works, earthworks construction, drilling, detailed engineering and
procurement of equipment and materials. Construction activities were suspended on November 30, 2011, at the request of Peru’s central government following increasing protests in Cajamarca by anti-mining activists led by the regional
president. At the request of the Peruvian central government, the environmental impact assessment prepared in connection with the project, which was previously approved in October 2010, will be reviewed by independent experts, in an effort to
resolve the alleged concerns around the environmental viability of Conga. Construction will remain suspended for the duration of the review, however, progress continues on engineering and procurement. Should we be unable to continue with the current
development plan at Conga, we may reprioritize and reallocate capital to development alternatives in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia. If the project proceeds, average annual estimated attributable gold production of



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

approximately 300,000 to 350,000 ounces and average annual estimated attributable copper production of approximately 80 to 120 million pounds per year are expected during the first five
years of production. At December 31, 2011, we reported 6.5 million attributable ounces of gold reserves and 1,690 million attributable pounds of copper reserves.

La Zanja, Peru.

We hold a 46.94% interest in La Zanja, a gold mine near the city of Cajamarca, Peru. The mine commenced operations in September 2010 and is operated by Buenaventura.
The site consists of two small open pits and one oxide leach pad. La Zanja produced 64,000 attributable gold ounces in 2011 and at December 31, 2011 we reported 0.3 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.

Merian, Suriname.

We hold a 50% interest in the Merian gold project, a joint venture with a subsidiary of Alcoa. We
will earn an 80% interest on completion of the feasibility study, which commenced in the third quarter of 2011 and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. Once we earn our 80% interest, Alcoa may, within 30 days, elect to purchase
a 10% interest in the joint venture from us (reducing our interest to 70%). If Alcoa elects this option, it will be required to solely fund the joint venture expenditures in an amount equal to two-thirds of the expenditures we incurred to complete
the feasibility study. Negotiations with the government of Suriname on a mineral agreement are continuing, which may affect our equity participation in the project.

Asia Pacific

Australia/New Zealand.

In Australia, mineral
exploration and mining titles are granted by the individual states or territories. Mineral titles may also be subject to native title legislation or, in the Northern Territory, to Aboriginal freehold title legislation that entitles indigenous
persons to compensation calculated by reference to the gross value of production. In 1992, the High Court of Australia held that Aboriginal people who have maintained a continuing connection with their land according to their traditions and customs
may hold certain rights in respect of the land (such rights commonly referred to as “native title”). Since the High Court’s decision, Australia has passed legislation providing for the protection of native title and established
procedures for Aboriginal people to claim these rights. The fact that native title is claimed with respect to an area, however, does not necessarily mean that native title exists, and disputes may be resolved by the courts.

Generally, under native title legislation, all mining titles granted before January 1, 1994 are valid. Titles granted between January 1,
1994 and December 23, 1996, however, may be subject to invalidation if they were not obtained in compliance with applicable legislative procedures, though subsequent legislation has validated some of these titles. After December 23, 1996,
mining titles over areas where native title is claimed to exist became subject to legislative processes that generally give native title claimants the “right to negotiate” with the title applicant for compensation and other conditions.
Native title holders do not have a veto over the granting of mining titles, but if agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be referred to the National Native Title Tribunal for decision.

Native title claims are not expected to have a material adverse effect on any of our operations in Australia. The High Court of Australia determined
in an August 2002 decision, which refined and narrowed the scope of native title, that native title does not subsist in minerals in Western Australia and that the rights granted under a mining title would, to the extent inconsistent with asserted
native title rights, operate to extinguish those native title rights. Generally, native title is only an issue for Newmont with respect to obtaining new mineral titles or moving from one form of title to another, for example, from an exploration
title to a mining title. In these cases, the requirements for negotiation and the possibility of paying compensation may result in delay and increased costs for mining in the affected areas. Similarly, the process of conducting Aboriginal heritage
surveys to identify and locate areas or sites of Aboriginal cultural significance can result in additional costs and delay in gaining access to land for exploration and mining-related activities.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

In Australia, various ad valorem royalties and taxes are paid to state and territorial
governments, typically based on a percentage of gross revenues or earnings. Indigenous communities have negotiated royalty payments as a condition to granting access to areas where they have native title or other property rights. A carbon dioxide
tax will commence in Australia beginning July 1, 2012, whereby the largest emitters of carbon dioxide will be required to pay A$23.00 per metric ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. The carbon price is indexed for inflation
through June 30, 2015, when a cap and trade system will be in place. Carbon costs will primarily be driven by electricity and diesel fuel consumption.

Boddington.

Boddington (100% owned) is located 81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Perth in Western Australia. Boddington has been wholly owned since June 2009 when Newmont acquired
the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial production in November 2009. Boddington produced 741,000 ounces of gold and
69 million pounds of copper in 2011, and at December 31, 2011 we reported 19.5 million ounces of gold reserves and 2,260 million pounds of copper reserves.

Kalgoorlie.

Kalgoorlie (50% owned) comprises the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600
kilometers) east of Perth in Western Australia. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick. The Super Pit is one of Australia’s largest gold mines in terms of gold
production and annual tons mined. During 2011, the Kalgoorlie operations produced 750,000 ounces of gold (375,000 attributable ounces), and at December 31, 2011 we reported 4.4 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.

Jundee.

Jundee (100% owned) is situated approximately 435 miles (700 kilometers) northeast of Perth in Western
Australia. We mined ore at Jundee solely from underground sources in 2011, with mill feed supplemented from oxide stockpiles for blending purposes. Jundee produced 333,000 ounces of gold in 2011 and at December 31, 2011 we reported
0.6 million ounces of gold reserves.

Tanami.

Tanami (100% owned) includes the Granites treatment
plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead Bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25
miles (40 kilometers) west of the Granites. Operations are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. In July 2011, a project to develop a shaft to support
underground operations was approved by the Board of Directors. The project will support underground expansion at the Callie and Auron ore bodies, reduce cut-off grade, enhance productivity and facilitate possible additional mine expansion. The
project is expected to add gold production of approximately 60,000 to 90,000 ounces per year during the first five years of production. First production is expected in 2015. During 2011, the Tanami operations produced 221,000 ounces of gold and at
December 31, 2011 we reported 2.5 million ounces of gold reserves.

Waihi.

Waihi (100% owned) is
located within the town of Waihi, approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand and currently consists of the Favona and Trio (currently under development) underground deposits and the Martha open pit mine. The Waihi
operation produced 97,000 ounces of gold in 2011 and at December 31, 2011 we reported 0.4 million ounces of gold reserves.

Duketon.

We have a 16.85% interest in Regis Resources Ltd. (“Regis”), which owns 100% of the Duketon gold
mine, located approximately 200 miles northeast of Kalgoorlie. Duketon commenced production in the third quarter of 2010 and produced 17,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2011. At December 31, 2011, we reported 0.5 million attributable
ounces of gold reserves.

Batu Hijau, Indonesia.

Batu Hijau is located on the island of Sumbawa,
approximately 950 miles (1,529 kilometers) east of Jakarta. Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which Newmont



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2011, Batu Hijau produced 283 million pounds of copper (137 million
attributable pounds) and 318,000 ounces of gold (154,000 attributable ounces). At December 31, 2011, we reported 3,730 million attributable pounds of copper reserves and 3.6 million attributable ounces of gold reserves at Batu Hijau.

We own 31.50% of the Batu Hijau mine through Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V. (“NTPBV”), which we own with an affiliate of
Sumitomo Corporation of Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTPBV and the Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTPBV in turn owns 56% of PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”), the Indonesian subsidiary that owns the Batu Hijau
copper and gold mine. The remaining 44% interest in PTNNT is owned by PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”), 24%; P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), 17.8%; and PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama (“PTIMI”), 2.2%.

On May 6, 2011, we announced that a definitive agreement was signed with an agency of the Indonesian Government’s Ministry of Finance for
the sale of the final 7% divestiture stake, as required under the terms of PTNNT’s Contract of Work with the Indonesian Government. NTPBV entered into the agreement with Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (“PIP”). The Government of Indonesia
designated PIP as the buyer for the final 7% interest by exercising a right of first refusal set out in the Contract of Work. Upon closing of the transaction, NTPBV’s interest in Batu Hijau will be reduced to 49%, as required under the Contract
of Work. The price agreed for the 7% stake is approximately $247. Closing of the transaction is pending receipt of approvals from certain Indonesian government ministries. Subsequent to signing the agreement, a disagreement arose between the
Ministry of Finance and the Indonesian parliament in regard to whether parliamentary approval was required to allow PIP to make the share purchase. The Ministry of Finance continues to dispute the need for parliamentary approval and further disputes
may arise in regard to the divestiture of the 2010 shares. NTPBV and PIP agreed to extend the period for satisfying the closing conditions of the agreement until May 6, 2012. Our ownership interest in PTNNT following the closing of the
transaction will be 27.56%.

We have identified Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements) in connection with our economic interests in PTNNT due to certain funding arrangements and shareholder commitments. We have financing arrangements with PTPI and PTIMI, unrelated noncontrolling shareholders of PTNNT, whereby we agreed to
advance certain funds to them in exchange for (i) a pledge of their combined 20% share of PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax, (iii) a commitment from them to support the application of
our standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine, and (iv) as of September 16, 2011 in respect of PTPI only, powers of attorney to vote and sell PTNNT shares in support of the pledge, enforceable in an event of default as further
security for the funding. As a result, PTPI and PTIMI were determined to be VIEs and our effective economic interest in PTNNT increased by 17% (20% interest net of withholding tax) to 48.50% during 2010. We currently provide management for the Batu
Hijau operation and our standards are applied at Batu Hijau.

In Indonesia, rights are granted to foreign investors to explore for and to
develop mineral resources within defined areas through Contracts of Work entered into with the Indonesian government. In 1986, PTNNT entered into a Contract of Work with the Indonesian government covering Batu Hijau, under which PTNNT was granted
the exclusive right to explore in the contract area, construct any required facilities, extract and process the mineralized materials, and sell and export the minerals produced, subject to certain requirements including Indonesian government
approvals and payment of royalties to the government. Under the Contract of Work, PTNNT has the right to continue operating the project for 30 years from operational start-up, or longer if approved by the Indonesian government.

Under the Contract of Work our ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine’s proven and probable reserves may be reduced in the future to as low
as 27.56% and ownership interest of NTPBV in PTNNT could be reduced to 49%, thus potentially reducing our ability to control the operation at Batu



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Hijau or apply our operating standards. As part of the negotiation of the divestiture sale agreements with PTMDB, the parties executed an operating agreement under which each party recognizes the
right of Newmont and Sumitomo to apply their operating standards at Batu Hijau and binds the parties to adhere to our standards for safety, environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The operating agreement remains in effect for so long
as NTPBV owns more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the operating agreement terminates, then we could lose effective control over the operations of Batu Hijau and will be at risk for operations conducted in a manner that could potentially reduce the
value of PTNNT or result in safety, environmental or social standards below those adhered to by us. Such loss of control may cause us to deconsolidate PTNNT for accounting purposes, which would reduce our reported consolidated sales, cost applicable
to sales, amortization, total assets and operating cash flow attributable to PTNNT. See Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Ahafo, Ghana.

Ahafo (100% owned) is located in the
Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. We currently operate four open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 11 operating and planned pits. Commercial production in the fourth pit, Amoma, began in
October 2010. The process plant consists of a conventional mill and carbon-in-leach circuit. Ahafo produced 566,000 ounces of gold in 2011, and at December 31, 2011 we reported 12.1 million ounces of gold reserves.

Akyem, Ghana

.    Akyem (100% owned) is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. The Akyem
project is advancing with awarding of 95% of all construction contracts, commencement of bulk earthworks, major civil work and underground utilities. The first structural concrete was placed in August 2011. Establishment of the first set of
households at the resettlement villages took place in October 2011. First production is anticipated in late 2013 to early 2014, with approximately three to six months expected for ramp-up from construction completion to commercial production. Gold
production is expected to be approximately 350,000 to 450,000 ounces per year for the first five years of the mine’s operating life of approximately 16 years (based on current gold reserves). At December 31, 2011, we reported
7.4 million ounces of gold reserves.

In December 2003, Ghana’s Parliament unanimously ratified an
Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) between Newmont and the government of Ghana. The Investment Agreement establishes a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of any Newmont project
in Ghana. Under the Investment Agreement, we will pay corporate income tax at the Ghana statutory tax rate (presently 25% but not to exceed 32.5%) and fixed gross royalties on gold production of 3.0% (3.6% for any production from forest reserve
areas). The government of Ghana is also entitled to receive 10% of a project’s net cash flow after we have recouped our investment and may acquire up to 20% of a project’s equity at fair market value on or after the 15

th

anniversary of such project’s commencement of production. The Investment Agreement
also contains commitments with respect to job training for local Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local goods and services and environmental protection. In 2009, the Minister of Finance implemented the National Fiscal Stabilization
Levy, which is an additional tax of profits. Negotiations are ongoing with the commissioner of the Ghana Internal Revenue Service on the applicability of the levy, given Newmont’s Investment Agreement. While negotiations are pending, we have
paid and included $39 in

Income and mining tax expense

to date under the levy.

In 2011, the Minister of Finance proposed the
following changes in Ghana’s tax laws: (i) an increase in the corporate income tax from 25% to 35%, (ii) the elimination of the National Fiscal Stabilization Levy, (iii) the introduction of a windfall tax of 10% and (iv) a
change in capital allowances to 20% over 5 years from the previously allowed 80% deduction in year one and then 50% per year on the remaining balance. Per our Investment Agreement, the increase in the corporate income tax rate would be limited
to 32.5% and the windfall tax of 10% would not be applicable to our Ghana operations.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

In addition, the government of Ghana recently established a National Re-Negotiation Team to review
fiscal regimes and mining agreements with a view to ensuring that Ghana benefits adequately and fairly from gains in the mining sector. As a result, our Investment Agreement could be subject to requests for renegotiation by the government of Ghana.

Proven and Probable Reserves

We had attributable proven and probable gold reserves of 98.8 million ounces at December 31, 2011, calculated at a gold price assumption
of $1,200, A$1,250 or NZ$1,600 per ounce. Our 2011 reserves would decline by approximately 5% (4.7 million ounces), if calculated at a $1,100 per ounce gold price. An increase in the gold price to $1,300 per ounce would increase reserves by
approximately 4% (3.9 million ounces), all other assumptions remaining constant. For 2010, reserves were calculated at a gold price assumption of $950, A$1,100 or NZ$1,350 per ounce.

At December 31, 2011, our proven and probable gold reserves in North America were 37.0 million ounces. Outside of North America, year-end
proven and probable gold reserves were 61.8 million ounces, including 31.5 million ounces in Asia Pacific, 19.5 million ounces in Africa and 10.8 million ounces in South America.

Our proven and probable copper reserves at December 31, 2011 were 9,720 million pounds. For 2011, reserves were calculated at a copper
price assumption of $3.00 or A$3.15 per pound, increased from $2.50 or A$2.95 per pound, used in 2010.

Our proven and probable silver
reserves at December 31, 2011 were 195 million ounces. For 2011, reserves were calculated at a silver price assumption of $22.00 or A$23.00 per ounce. Silver reserves are generally a by-product of gold and/or copper reserves, with
significant enough levels to be estimated and included in calculations for mine planning and operations. While details of silver reserves were not provided in 2010, reserves disclosed in footnotes used price assumptions of $15.00 or A$17.50 per
ounce in 2010.

Under our current mining plans, all of our reserves are located on fee property or mining claims or will be depleted
during the terms of existing mining licenses or concessions, or where applicable, any assured renewal or extension periods for such licenses or concessions.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and
metallurgical testing from which we determined economic feasibility. Metal price assumptions follow U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidance not to exceed a three year trailing average. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several
factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables below
list the average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into account the relevant processing methods. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process, varies with material type, price,
metallurgical recoveries, operating costs and co- or by-product credits.

The proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are
estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold and copper will be realized. Ounces of gold or pounds of copper included in the proven and probable reserves
are calculated without regard to any losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold and copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced
metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.

We publish reserves annually, and will recalculate reserves at December 31, 2012, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, in future
production and capital costs, divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and additions during 2012.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

The following tables detail gold proven and probable reserves reflecting only those reserves
attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest at December 31, 2011 and 2010:



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

(1)

The term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve
determination.

The term “economically,” as used in the definition of reserve, means that profitable
extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in a full feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions.

The term “legally,” as used in the definition of reserve, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been
obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont must have a justifiable expectation, based on



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and
in a timeframe consistent with Newmont’s current mine plans.

The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which
(a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (c) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements
are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.

The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are
otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.

Proven and probable reserves include gold, copper or silver attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest.

Proven and probable reserves were calculated using different cut-off grades. The term “cut-off grade” means the lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process. Cut-off grades vary
between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the ore to gold, copper or silver extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available.

2011 reserves were calculated at a gold price of $1,200, A$1,250 or NZ$1,600 per ounce unless otherwise noted.

2010 reserves were calculated at a gold price of $950, A$1,100 or NZ$1,350 per ounce unless otherwise noted.

MINE

SAFETY DISCLOSURE

S

At Newmont, safety is a core value and we strive for superior performance. Our health and safety management system, which includes detailed standards and procedures for safe production, addresses topics such as
employee training, risk management, workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation and program auditing. In addition to strong leadership and involvement from all levels of the organization, these programs and procedures form the
cornerstone of safety at Newmont, ensuring that employees are provided a safe and healthy environment and are intended to reduce workplace accidents, incidents and losses, comply with all mining-related regulations and provide support for both
regulators and the industry to improve mine safety.

In addition, we have established our “Rapid Response” process to mitigate
and prevent the escalation of adverse consequences if existing risk management controls fail, particularly if an incident may have the potential to seriously impact the safety of employees, the community or the environment. This process provides
appropriate support to an affected site to complement their technical response to an incident, so as to reduce the impact by considering the environmental, strategic, legal, financial and public image aspects of the incident, to ensure
communications are being carried out in accordance with legal and ethical requirements and to identify actions in addition to those addressing the immediate hazards.

The operation of our U.S. based mines is subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine
Act”). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Following passage of The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, MSHA
significantly increased the numbers of citations and orders charged against mining operations. The dollar penalties assessed for citations issued has also increased in recent years.

Newmont is required to report certain mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, and that required information is included in Exhibit 95 and is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASE OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is listed and principally traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “NEM”.

On November 9, 2009, Newmont announced its intention to seek removal from the official list of the Australian Stock Exchange (“ASX”)
and to suspend trading of the CHESS Depositary Interests (“CDIs”). The announcement was due to a low level of CDIs quoted on the ASX with low levels of trading when compared to other exchanges where it may trade. Further, investors seeking
to purchase shares in Newmont could do so on the NYSE. The CDIs were suspended from trading on the ASX on February 10, 2010 and removed from the official list of the ASX on February 17, 2010.

Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited’s exchangeable shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol “NMC”.
On December 15, 2011, as a result of a plan of arrangement, holders of exchangeable shares received, at their election, for each existing exchangeable share, one new exchangeable share of Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited or one
share of Newmont common stock. In connection with the plan of arrangement, 1.6 million shares were converted from exchangeable shares to Newmont common stock. For a description of the arrangement, please see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on
December 19, 2012.

On February 15, 2012, there were 4,914,758 exchangeable shares outstanding, which were held by 14 holders of
record. The exchangeable shares are exchangeable at the option of the holders into Newmont common stock. Holders of Exchangeable Shares are therefore entitled to receive dividends equivalent to those that Newmont declares on its common stock.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the closing high and low sales prices per share of Newmont’s common
stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape:

On February 15, 2012, there were 490,150,298 shares of Newmont’s common stock outstanding, which were held
by approximately 12,184 stockholders of record. Dividends of $0.15, $0.20, $0.30 and $0.35 per share of common stock outstanding were declared in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, of 2011, for a total of $1.00 per share
during 2011. A dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock outstanding was declared in the first and second quarters of 2010, while a dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock outstanding was declared in the third and fourth quarters of 2010, for
a total of $0.50 per share during 2010.

In April 2011, the Company introduced the first gold price-linked dividend policy, followed by
the announcement of an enhanced gold price-linked dividend policy in September 2011, under which the Company’s annual dividend has the potential to increase to $4.70 per share if the Company’s average realized gold price exceeds $2,500 per
ounce. Under the policy, unless otherwise determined by the



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Board of Directors (the “Board”), the dividend will be calculated based upon the average gold price realized by the Company during the preceding quarter in the manner highlighted in the
table below:

This dividend policy is intended as a non-binding guideline which will be periodically reviewed and reassessed by
the Board. The declaration and payment of future dividends remains at the discretion of the Board and will depend on the Company’s financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.

During the period from October 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011, 2,264 shares of Newmont’s equity securities registered
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, were purchased by the Company, or an affiliated purchaser.

Advancing our project pipeline.

Our current plans reflect the intended development of assets within our global development portfolio to increase annual attributable gold production
to approximately 7 million ounces by 2017. This production target represents a potential increase of approximately 35% in anticipated 2017 annual production from the Company’s 2011 attributable gold production of 5.2 million ounces.
We also manage our wider project portfolio to maintain flexibility to address the development risks associated with our projects, including permitting, local community and government support, engineering and procurement availability, technical
issues, escalating costs and other associated risks that could adversely impact the timing and costs of certain opportunities.

Our
development opportunities that have advanced to full funding approval during 2011, and comprise a significant part of the Company’s growth strategy, include Akyem in Ghana, Conga in Peru and the Tanami Shaft in Australia, as described further
below.

Akyem, Ghana

.    Since full funding approval by the Board of Directors (the “Board”) in
March 2011, the project has continued to advance with award of the main civil and mechanical construction contracts, commencement of bulk earthworks, major civil work and underground utilities. First structural concrete was placed in August 2011 and
the establishment of the first set of households at the resettlement villages took place in October 2011. First production is expected in late 2013 to early 2014 with approximately three to six months expected for ramp-up to commercial production.
Gold production is expected to be approximately 350,000 to 450,000 ounces per year at

Costs applicable to sales

of $450 to $550 per ounce for the first five years of the mine’s operating life of approximately 16 years (based on current
gold reserves). Capital costs are estimated at $850 to $1,100, of which approximately $450 have been incurred at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, we reported 7.4 million ounces of gold reserves at Akyem.

Conga, Peru

.    Following the full funding approval by the Board in July 2011, the project progressed infrastructure
works, earthworks construction, drilling, detailed engineering and procurement of equipment and materials. Construction activities on the Conga project were suspended on November 30, 2011, at the request of Peru’s central government
following increasing protests in Cajamarca by anti-mining activists led by the regional president. At the request of the Peruvian central



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

government, the environmental impact assessment prepared in connection with the project, which was previously approved by the central government in October 2010, will be reviewed by independent
experts in an effort to resolve allegations around the environmental viability of Conga. Construction will remain suspended for the duration of the review; however, progress continues on engineering and procurement work. Should we be unable to
continue with the current development plan at Conga, we may reprioritize and reallocate capital to development alternatives in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia. If the project proceeds, gold production is expected to be approximately 300,000
to 350,000 attributable ounces per year during the first five years of production at average

Costs applicable to sales

of $400 to $450 per ounce. Copper production is expected to be approximately 80 to 120 million pounds per year during
the first five years of production at average

Costs applicable to sales

of $1.25 to $1.75 per pound. The project has an anticipated mine life of approximately 19 years, with additional district exploration potential. Capital costs are
estimated at $4,000 to $4,800 ($2,000 to $2,400 attributable to Newmont) of which approximately $1,000 have been incurred at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011 we reported 6.5 million attributable ounces of gold reserves and
1,690 million attributable pounds of copper reserves at Conga. See Risk Factor – “Our operations at Yanacocha and the development of our Conga Project in Peru are subject to political and social unrest risks, which have resulted most
recently in the suspension of construction activities in our Conga project” for a description of political risks related to the project’s development.

Tanami Shaft, Australia

.    Following the full funding approval by the Board in July 2011, development efforts have progressed. The project will support underground expansion at the
Callie and Auron ore bodies, reduce cut-off grade, enhance productivity and facilitate possible additional mine expansion. The project is expected to add gold production of approximately 60,000 to 90,000 ounces per year during the first five years
of production while lowering

Costs applicable to sales

for the first five years by approximately $100 per ounce. First production is expected in 2015. Capital costs are expected to be approximately $400 to $450, of which approximately $30
have been incurred at December 31, 2011.

In addition to these projects receiving full funding decisions in 2011, as described
above, we advanced approximately 20 earlier stage development assets through our project pipeline in our four operating regions. The exploration, construction and operation of these earlier stage development assets will require significant funding
when they go into execution. Two of these projects are described further below:

Merian,
Suriname

.    Feasibility study work for the Merian project began in the third quarter of 2011 and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. The Company has also recently commenced negotiations for a mineral
agreement with the government of Suriname. The development of the Merian project allows Newmont to pursue a new district with upside potential and the opportunity to grow and extend the operating life of the South American region. First
production is targeted for 2015 with initial estimated attributable gold production of approximately 300,000 ounces per year.

Long
Canyon, Nevada

.    Since completing the acquisition of Fronteer Gold Inc. (“Fronteer”) in April 2011, the project entered into the pre-feasibility stage as we further develop our understanding of what we expect
could be another Carlin-type trend at Long Canyon. We have received an expanded exploration area permit allowing access to project targets. We continue to make progress on the drilling program. A total of 72 kilometers of drilling was completed in
2011 and we anticipate an additional 65 kilometers to be drilled in 2012. Our intention is to bring the project into production in 2017 with initial estimated gold production of approximately 200,000 to 300,000 ounces per year.

Hope Bay, Canada.

On January 31, 2012, we announced that our Hope Bay project was placed on care and maintenance
following our evaluation of development options and economic feasibility for the project compared with other project and development opportunities within our wider project pipeline. The Hope Bay project is not included as part of our 2017 strategic
growth plan or capital



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

expenditure outlook for 2012. At December 31, 2011, we recorded an impairment of $2,097 related to Hope Bay.

Gold Price-Linked Dividend

In April 2011, the Company introduced the first gold
price-linked dividend policy, followed by the announcement of an enhanced gold price-linked dividend policy in September 2011, under which the Company’s annual dividend has the potential to increase to $4.70 per share if the Company’s
average realized gold price exceeds $2,500 per ounce. Under the policy, unless otherwise determined by the Board, the dividend will be calculated based upon our average realized gold price during the preceding quarter in the manner highlighted in
the table below:

The fourth quarter 2011 dividend under this policy of $0.35 per share (based on our third quarter 2011 average
realized gold price of $1,695 per ounce) represents an increase of 17% over the $0.30 dividend paid in the third quarter of 2011, and an increase of 133% over the fourth quarter 2010 dividend. This dividend policy is intended as a non-binding
guideline which will be periodically reviewed and reassessed by the Board. The declaration and payment of future dividends remains at the discretion of the Board and will depend on the Company’s financial results, cash requirements, future
prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.

Consolidated Financial Performance

Sales increased 9% in 2011 compared to 2010 due to
higher average realized gold and copper prices, partially offset by fewer consolidated gold ounces and copper pounds sold. The average realized gold price increased 28% to $1,562 per ounce in 2011 from $1,222 per ounce in 2010. The average realized
copper price, including $92 unfavorable mark to market adjustments on provisionally priced copper sales, increased 3% to $3.54 per pound in 2011 compared to $3.43 per pound in 2010. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to lower
production in Asia Pacific,



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

primarily Batu Hijau, and South America, partially offset by higher production in North America. Copper pounds sold decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to lower production at Batu Hijau,
partially offset by higher production at Boddington.

Costs applicable to sales

increased 12% in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher waste mining activities, higher milling and royalty costs, higher diesel prices and a stronger Australian
dollar.

Liquidity

Our financial position was as follows:

During 2011, our debt and liquidity positions were affected by the following:

•

Net cash provided from continuing operations of $3,591;

•

Capital expenditures of $2,787;

•

Acquisition of Fronteer for $2,257;

•

Income and mining taxes paid of $1,526;

•

Debt payments of $262, net;

•

Dividends paid to common shareholders of $494; and

•

Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $117.

Looking Forward

We will continue to focus on operational and project excellence in 2012
to deliver on our plans and continue the advancement of our project pipeline, resulting in the following expectations for 2012:

•

Attributable gold production of approximately 5.0 to 5.2 million ounces, primarily due to lower production at Batu Hijau as it continues with Phase 6
stripping, partially offset by higher production at Nevada and Ahafo;

•

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated gold ounce sold of $625 to $675 due to lower production at Batu Hijau combined with higher expected costs for
energy, labor and contracted services;

•

Attributable copper production of approximately 150 to 170 million pounds, primarily due to the continuation of Phase 6 stripping at Batu Hijau, at

Costs
applicable to sales

per consolidated copper pound sold of approximately $1.80 to $2.20 due to lower production at Batu Hijau;

•

Consolidated capital expenditures of approximately $4,000 to $4,300 in 2012, with approximately 60% to be spent on major project initiatives, including further
development of Akyem in Ghana, the Tanami shaft in Australia and potentially Conga in Peru. The remaining 40% is expected to be spent on sustaining and maintenance capital;

•

Exploration

expense of approximately $400 to $430 focused primarily on Ahafo in Africa, Long Canyon in Nevada, Tanami in Australia and other projects in
all regions; and

•

Advanced projects, research and development

expense of approximately $475 to $525 focused primarily on Merian in Suriname, Midas, Long Canyon and Vista
Vein in Nevada, Chaquicocha underground in Peru, Elang in Indonesia and Ahafo mill expansion in Africa.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Certain key factors will affect our future financial and operating results. These include, but are
not limited to, the following:

•

Our 2012 expectations, particularly with respect to production volumes and

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce or pound, may differ significantly from
actual quarter and full year results due to variations in mine planning and sequencing, ore grades and hardness, metal recoveries, waste removal, commodity input prices and foreign currency exchange rates; and

•

Future investments in the Akyem project in Ghana, the Conga project in Peru, the Long Canyon project in Nevada, the Merian project in Suriname and the Tanami
shaft in Australia will require significant funding. Our operating cash flow may become insufficient to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service
significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices and our operational performance, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial
challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends could be significantly constrained.

•

In 2011, we entered into forward starting swap contracts with a total notional amount of $2,000. These contracts hedge movements in treasury rates related to an
expected debt issuance in the first half of 2012. At December 31, 2011, the hedge contracts were in a liability position of $399. The proceeds from the expected debt issuance will be adjusted by the fair value of the swap contracts at the time
of issuance. If the anticipated debt issuance does not proceed, we will be required to cash settle the swap contracts with the full amount of the payment charged against earnings.

•

In 2011, the Company expressed the intent to exercise the early purchase option on the refractory ore treatment plant capital lease related to Mill 6 in Nevada.
As a result, we anticipate aggregate principal payments of approximately $165 in 2012.

Accounting
Developments

For a discussion of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, see Note
2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Policies

Listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the
estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported.

Amortization

Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment
are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment and their components. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on
proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine.

Costs
incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. At our surface mines, these costs include costs to
further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At our underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using the units-of-production (“UOP”) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be
produced from proven and probable reserves.

Major development costs incurred after the commencement of production are amortized using
the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. To the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and
probable reserves of the entire ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable
reserves of that specific ore block or area.

The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization
charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to the extent that there were
significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These changes could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and
actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. If
reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. Such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives
of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves.

The expected useful lives used in amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above.
Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for the purpose of amortization calculations.

Carrying Value of Stockpiles

Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Mine sequencing may result in mining material at a faster rate than can be processed. We generally process the
highest ore grade material first to maximize metal production; however, a blend of stockpiled material may be processed to balance hardness and/or metallurgy in order to maximize throughput and recovery. Processing of lower grade stockpiled ore may
continue after mining operations are completed. Sulfide ore stockpiles are subject to oxidation over time which can reduce expected future recoveries. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the
number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are added to stockpiles based on
current mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable overhead and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed at each stockpile’s average cost per recoverable ounce of gold or pound of
copper as material is processed. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, stockpiles had a total carrying value of $2,410 and $1,786, respectively.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

The following is a summary of our ore stockpiles:

We record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value (“NRV”), and carrying values are
evaluated at least quarterly. NRV represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to
record write-downs of stockpiles include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. The significant assumptions in
determining the stockpile NRV for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2011 included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce, a long-term copper price
of $3.50 per pound and a U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $1.00 per A$1.00. If short-term and long-term metals prices decrease, the value of the stockpiles decrease, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of stockpiles to NRV.

The NRV measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating
and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no
assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.

Carrying Value of
Ore on Leach Pads

Ore on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed on leach pads where a weak cyanide solution is
applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are
recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad.

Estimates of recoverable gold on the leach
pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

(based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each
year thereafter until the leaching process is complete.

Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are
reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the
metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, our operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable
quantities of gold on our leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to NRV are accounted for on a prospective basis. The significant
assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2011 apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation included a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce. If
short-term and long-term gold prices decrease, the value of the ore on leach pads decrease, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to NRV. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, leach pads had a total carrying value of $532
and $588, respectively.

The following is a summary of our ore on leach pads:

Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets

We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may
not be recoverable. Asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded
based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, trends and related factors),
production levels, operating costs, capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine plans. The significant assumptions in determining the future cash flows for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2011 apart from
production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $3.50 per pound and U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $1.00 per A$1.00.
During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded impairments of $2,084, $6, and $7, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of property, plant and mine development as part of

Write-down of property, plant and mine development.

Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable
reserves are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The term “recoverable minerals” refers to the estimated amount of gold or
other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management’s relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are
grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups.

As discussed above under Amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally, production, capital and reclamation
costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to
those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as
exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling.

With the exception of the Call Spread Transactions (as described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), all financial instruments
that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the statements of consolidated income, except for the effective portion of the change in fair value of
derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges. Management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates
and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair value of derivatives. Certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the
effective portion of changes in fair value of these instruments are deferred in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

and will be recognized in the statements of consolidated income when the underlying transaction designated as the hedged
item impacts earnings. The derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges are designated against foreign currency expenditures, diesel purchases, or future debt interest payments where management believes the forecasted transaction is
probable of occurring. To the extent that management determines that the forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses deferred in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

would be reclassified to the statements
of consolidated income immediately.

Reclamation and Remediation Obligations

Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated
present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and remediation costs. Reclamation obligations are based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance
will occur. We review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine.

Reclamation obligations for inactive mines
are accrued based on management’s best estimate of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected
in earnings in the period an estimate is revised.

Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make
estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts
estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and
remediation.

Income and Mining Taxes

We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires
management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer above to Carrying
Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax
assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets recorded
at the reporting date.

Our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in
multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize
potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of
changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax
liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If an estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. We recognize interest and
penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in

Costs applicable to sales

for gold increased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher mining and milling costs,
higher royalties and allocation of costs to gold from a higher gold price, partially offset by lower sales volumes, higher silver and copper by-product credits and a buildup of stockpiles. The increase in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to a full year
of Boddington production and higher mining and milling costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes, higher silver by-product credits and a build-up of inventories and stockpiles.

Costs applicable to sales

for copper increased in 2011 from
2010 due to higher waste mining at Batu Hijau and milling costs at Boddington, partially offset by a higher allocation of costs to gold. The increase in 2010 from 2009 was due to higher production and waste mining costs at Batu Hijau and a full year
of Boddington production. For a complete discussion regarding variations in operations, see

Exploration

expense increased to $350 in 2011 from $218 in 2010 due to additional near mine expenditures in
all regions, with the largest increases at Nevada, Yanacocha, Ahafo, Jundee and Tanami and increased regional expenditures at Long Canyon and Hope Bay.

Exploration

expense increased in 2010 from $187 in 2009 due to additional near mine
expenditures in all regions, with the

largest increase in Nevada at Leeville/Turf and Midas. We expect

Exploration

expense to increase to

approximately $400 to $430 in 2012, focused primarily on Long Canyon in Nevada, Tanami in Australia and other projects in all other regions.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

During 2011, we added 11.6 million ounces to proven and probable reserves, with
6.3 million ounces of depletion. Reserve additions were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Ahafo (2.7 million ounces), Carlin open pit, (2.3 million ounces), Phoenix (1.5 million ounces), Carlin underground (1.2 million
ounces), Kalgoorlie (1.0 million ounces) and Tanami (0.7 million ounces) with the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in all regions (2.2 million ounces). The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on
these reserve additions was an increase of 3.3 million ounces.

During 2010, we added 8.2 million ounces to proven and probable
reserves, with 6.5 million ounces of depletion. Reserve additions were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Leeville (1.8 million ounces), Ahafo (1.5 million ounces), Twin Creeks (1.4 million ounces), Phoenix (0.8 million
ounces), La Herradura (0.7 million ounces) and Tanami (0.7 million ounces) with most of the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in the United States, Australia and South America (1.8 million ounces). Gold reserves were
revised down by 0.5 million ounces at Akyem in Ghana, primarily due to new mining assumptions and higher cutoff grades. The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of 1.7 million
ounces.

During 2009, we added 6.4 million ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 6.8 million ounces of depletion.
Reserve additions were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Gold Quarry (2.9 million ounces), Boddington (1.3 million ounces), Tanami (0.5 million ounces) and Ahafo (0.5 million ounces) with most of the remaining additions coming
from open pit and underground sources in Australia and South America (0.6 million ounces). Gold reserves were revised down by 0.3 million ounces at Phoenix in Nevada, primarily due to metallurgy, geology and modeling impacts. The estimated
impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of 1.7 million ounces.

Advanced
projects, research and development

expense includes development project management costs, feasibility studies and certain drilling costs.

Advanced projects, research and development

expense increased 73% in 2011 compared to 2010 due to
increased spending to accelerate internal growth opportunities across our portfolio. Projects in North America include Hope Bay in Canada, the Nevada portfolio project including Long Canyon, Vista Vein and the Phoenix copper leach. Projects in South
America include the Conga and Chaquicocha projects in Peru and the Merian gold project in Suriname. Projects in Asia Pacific include Elang in Indonesia. Projects in Africa include the Akyem gold project in Ghana and Subika expansion at Ahafo in
Ghana. We expect

Advanced projects, research and development

expense to be approximately $475 to $525 in 2012 focused primarily on Merian in Suriname, Midas, Long Canyon and Vista Vein in Nevada, Chaquicocha underground in Peru, Elang in
Indonesia and Ahafo mill expansion in Africa.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

General and administrative

expense increased to $198 in 2011 compared to $178 in 2010 due to higher benefit
and compensation costs and higher consulting fees.

General and administrative

expense increased in 2010 compared to $159 in 2009 due to higher benefit and compensation costs.

General and administrative

expense as a percentage of

Sales

was 1.9% in 2011, compared to 1.9% and 2.1% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. We expect

General and administrative

expense to be approximately $210 to $230 in 2012.

Write-down of property, plant and mine development

totaled $2,084, $6 and $7 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The write-down in 2011 is
primarily related to the Hope Bay project that resulted from our decision to place the project on care and maintenance and to focus on environmental and regulatory compliance spending. We placed the Hope Bay project on care and maintenance after
evaluating development options and economic feasibility for the project compared with other project and development opportunities within our wider project pipeline. The 2010 write-down is primarily related to asset impairments at Nevada and the 2009
write-down is primarily related to asset impairments at Batu Hijau.

Other expense, net

was $265, $261 and $358 for 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. The increase in 2011 over 2010 is due to Fronteer acquisition costs, an impairment of materials and supplies related to a decision to place the Hope Bay project on care and maintenance and higher regional and administration
costs, partially offset by lower community development costs at Batu Hijau. The decrease in 2010 over 2009 is due to costs related to acquiring the remaining interest in Boddington in 2009, higher charges related to the Western Australian power
plant in 2009, and a workforce reduction that impacted 3% of our global workforce in 2009, partially offset by higher community development costs at Batu Hijau in 2010.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Other income, net

was $12, $109 and $88 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease
in 2011 over 2010 is due to other-than-temporary impairment charges for marketable securities primarily acquired with the Fronteer acquisition of $180 in 2011, a decrease in Canadian Oil Sands dividends as well as the sale of non-core assets in
2010, partially offset by the gain on the sale of other marketable equity securities, an increase in income from developing projects and a decrease in foreign exchange losses. The increase in 2010 over 2009 is primarily related to an increase in
Canadian Oil Sands dividends due to higher oil prices in 2010 and sales of non-core assets, partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses.

Interest expense, net

was $244, $279 and $120 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $52, $21 and $111 in each year, respectively.

Interest expense, net

decreased in 2011
compared to 2010 due to the increase in capitalized interest for the advancement of our Conga and Akyem projects.

Interest expense, net

increased in 2010 from 2009 due to the reduction in capitalized interest as Boddington achieved commercial
production in November 2009 and interest related to the 2019 and 2039 senior notes issued during September 2009, partially offset by lower interest due to the prepayment in 2010 of the PTNNT project financing and Yanacocha senior notes and credit
facility. We expect

Interest expense, net

to be approximately $240 to $260 in 2012.

Income and mining tax expense

was
$713, $856 and $829 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective tax rates were 39%, 21% and 28% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher tax rate in 2011 is primarily due to the impairment related to the Hope Bay project and the
impact it had on the realizability of our Canadian deferred tax assets. Without the write-down on the Hope Bay project, the annual effective tax rate would have been 30%. The impairment resulted in a 12% tax rate increase due to the recording of
valuation allowances on Canadian deferred tax assets, partially offset by a 3% benefit from other items. The lower effective tax rate in 2010 is primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of “check the box” elections made with
respect to certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. As a result of the elections, the subsidiaries are treated as flow-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Without the restructuring, the effective tax rate for 2010 would have been
32%.

The factors that most significantly impacted our effective tax rates for the three periods are percentage depletion, changes in
estimates of reserves for income tax uncertainties, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, and the impact of certain specific transactions. Many of these factors are sensitive to the average realized price of gold and other metals. For
a complete discussion, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During the year, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued a
Technical Advice Memorandum (“TAM”) to the Company regarding the U.S. income tax treatment of the Price Capped Forward Sales Contracts settled in cash in 2007. The TAM provides guidance which is unfavorable to the Company. The Company
intends to vigorously defend its positions through all processes available to it and believes it should prevail.

Based on the
uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing our effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, the effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods.
The effective tax rate is expected to be between 28% and 32% in 2012.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

was as
follows:



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

decreased in 2011 from 2010 as a result
of decreased earnings at Batu Hijau, partially offset by increased earnings at Yanacocha. The 2010 increase over 2009 was a result of higher earnings at Batu Hijau and the required March 2010 divestiture of shares in Batu Hijau, partially offset by
lower earnings at Yanacocha and the additional 17% economic interest in Batu Hijau as a result of advancing funds to certain noncontrolling shareholders in exchange for an assignment of their Batu Hijau dividends, net of withholding tax. See Note 13
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the changes in our Batu Hijau ownership and economic interests.

Equity
income (loss) of affiliates

was as follows:

We have a 46.94% interest in Minera La Zanja, S.R.L. (“La Zanja”), a gold project near the city of
Cajamarca, Peru. The remaining interest is held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”). The mine commenced operations in September 2010 and is operated by Buenaventura. Newmont received dividends of $31 during
2011 from its interest in La Zanja. We have a 43.50% interest in Euronimba Ltd. (“Euronimba”), with the remaining interests held by BHP Billiton (43.50%) and Areva (13%). Euronimba owns 95% of the Nimba iron ore project located in the
Republic of Guinea which is in the early stages of development. The AGR Matthey Joint Venture (“AGR”), a gold refinery in which Newmont held a 40% interest, was dissolved on March 30, 2010. Newmont received consideration of $14 from
the dissolution and recorded a gain of $6 during 2010. Newmont received dividends of $7 and $2 during 2010 and 2009, respectively, from its interests in AGR.

Loss from discontinued operations

was as follows:

Discontinued operations include Holloway Mining Company, which owned the Holt-McDermott property (“Holt
property”) that was sold to St. Andrew Goldfields Ltd. (“St. Andrew”) in 2006. In 2009, the Superior Court issued a decision finding Newmont Canada Corporation (“Newmont Canada”) liable for a sliding scale royalty on
production from the Holt property, which Newmont Canada appealed. In 2010, we recognized a $28 charge, net of tax benefits of $12, related to these legal claims. In 2011, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the Superior Court ruling resulting in an
additional $136 charge, net of tax benefits of $7.

In 2009, we sold our interest in Kori Kollo in Bolivia. As part of the transaction,
a reclamation trust fund was established with the proceeds to be made available exclusively to pay for closure and reclamation costs when operations eventually cease. We recognized a $16 charge in 2009, net of tax benefits of $27, related to the
sale.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Other comprehensive loss,

net of tax was $456 in 2011 and included non-cash adjustments for
a $195 net loss in value of marketable securities primarily related to Canadian Oil Sands Trust and Gabriel Resources Ltd., a $8 net gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $60 net loss related to
pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments primarily as a result of utilizing a lower discount rate and lower than expected return on plan assets, and a $209 net loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges due mainly to a loss on
forward starting swap contracts partially offset by foreign currency hedge gains.

Other comprehensive income,

net of tax was $484 in 2010 and included non-cash adjustments for a $269 net gain in value of marketable securities primarily
related to Gabriel Resources Ltd. and Regis Resources Ltd., a $98 net gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $13 net loss related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments primarily as a
result of utilizing a lower discount rate, and a $130 net gain on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges due mainly to foreign currency hedge gains.

Other comprehensive income,

net of tax was $882 in 2009 and included non-cash adjustments
for a $418 net gain in value of marketable securities related to Canadian Oil Sands Trust and Gabriel Resources Ltd., a $264 net gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $14 net gain related to pension
and other post-retirement benefit adjustments primarily as a result of utilizing a higher discount rate, and a $186 net gain on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges due mainly to foreign currency hedge gains.

2011 compared to 2010

Consolidated gold ounces produced decreased 9% due to:

•

lower production from South America due to lower leach placement at Yanacocha from changes in mine sequencing; and

•

lower production from Asia Pacific due to higher waste stripping in Phase 6 at Batu Hijau, resulting in processing lower grade stockpiled material; partially
offset by

•

higher production from North America due to a full year of Soledad-Dipolos production at La Herradura in 2011; and

•

higher production from Africa due to a full year of production from the Amoma pit at Ahafo.

Consolidated copper pounds produced decreased 41% due to higher waste stripping in Phase 6 at Batu Hijau resulting in processing lower grade
stockpiled material, partially offset by higher grade and throughput at Boddington.

Attributable gold ounces produced decreased 4% due
to lower production from Batu Hijau and Yanacocha, partially offset by higher production from La Herradura. Lower attributable copper pounds produced also resulted from lower production at Batu Hijau.

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated gold ounce sold increased 22% due to lower production from Batu Hijau and Yanacocha, higher
royalty and waste mining costs, higher co-product allocation of costs to gold and a stronger Australian dollar, partially offset by higher silver and copper by-product credits.

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated copper pound sold
increased 58% due to lower production from Batu Hijau, higher waste mining at Batu Hijau and higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington, partially offset by lower co-product allocation of costs to copper.

2010 compared to 2009

Consolidated gold ounces produced decreased slightly due to:

•

lower production from South America due to mine sequencing at Yanacocha resulting in increased waste mining, lower leach placement and lower mill ore grade; and

•

lower production from North America due to completion of mining at Deep Post in 2009 and geotechnical issues at Gold Quarry in Nevada; mostly offset by

.    Gold and copper production increased 2% and 19%, respectively, due to higher mill throughput
and higher copper grade, partially offset by lower recoveries and lower gold grade.

Costs applicable to sales

increased 16% per ounce and 9% per pound, respectively, due to higher mining and mill maintenance costs, higher royalty
costs and a stronger Australian dollar, net of hedging gains, partially offset by higher production and higher silver by-product credits. Changes in Australia exchange rates increased

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce by $33 and per pound
by $0.08.

Costs applicable to sales

and

Amortization

per ounce and per pound were also impacted by a higher allocation of costs to gold.

Batu Hijau, Indonesia

.    Copper and gold production decreased 48% and 57%, respectively, due to lower throughput, grade and recovery as a result of processing more stockpiled material,
compared to a higher proportion of high grade Phase 5 ore in 2010, and mill down time from motor replacements during the second and third quarters of 2011. Waste tons mined increased 135% as Phase 6 waste removal continues as planned. The Company
expects to process primarily stockpiled ore until Phase 6 ore becomes the primary mill feed in late 2013.

Costs applicable to sales

increased 61% per pound and 101% per ounce due to lower production, higher waste mining and higher
labor.

Amortization

increased 26% per pound and 62% per ounce due to equipment additions and lower production.

Costs applicable to sales

Boddington, Australia

.    Boddington produced 728,000 ounces of gold and 58 million pounds of copper at

Costs
applicable to sales

of $590 per ounce and $1.86 per pound. As Boddington continued to ramp-up in 2010, production was below original expectations due to lower than anticipated gold grade and mill throughput.

Costs applicable to sales

were
higher than expected due to higher mining and mill maintenance costs. Changes in Australia exchange rates increased

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce and per pound by $59 and $0.19, respectively.

Amortization

per ounce was higher
than expected due to lower production.

Batu Hijau, Indonesia

.    Copper and gold production increased 10% and
32%, respectively, due to higher grade and mill throughput as a result of mining at the bottom of Phase 5 and processing softer ore, partially offset by lower recovery. Unseasonably dry weather permitted additional mining in the bottom of Phase 5
during the fourth quarter.

Costs applicable to sales

increased 11% per pound and per ounce due to higher waste mining and milling costs, including higher labor and diesel costs.

Amortization

increased 19% per pound and
15% per ounce due to equipment additions, partially offset by higher production.

Other Australia/New

NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Gold production for Asia Pacific is expected to decrease in 2012 to approximately 1.8 to
1.9 million ounces attributable to Newmont at higher consolidated

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce of approximately $800 to $850 in 2012, primarily due to lower production at Batu Hijau, a stronger forecasted Australian dollar, net of
hedging and higher labor and commodity costs. We expect copper production for the Asia Pacific region of approximately 150 to 170 million pounds attributable to Newmont at consolidated

Costs applicable to sales

per pound of approximately
$1.80 to $2.20 in 2012.

Gold ounces produced
increased 4% due to higher throughput and recovery. Ore tons mined increased 28% from a full year of production at Amoma.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased 5% due to higher labor, commodity and royalty costs, partially offset by
higher production.

Amortization

2010 compared to 2009

Ahafo, Ghana.

Gold ounces produced increased due to higher grade ore mined at Apensu in 2010 and the commencement of
production at Amoma in October 2010.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased slightly due to higher labor, power, diesel and royalty costs, partially offset by higher production.

Amortization

per ounce increased 20% due to higher
capitalized mine development and equipment additions.

Gold production for the Africa operations is expected to increase in 2012 to
approximately 570,000 to 600,000 ounces due to higher ore grade.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce of approximately $500 to $550 are expected for 2012, primarily as a result of higher mining and milling costs.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

Foreign currency exchange rates can increase or decrease profit margins and

Costs applicable to sales

to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies. Such fluctuations have not had a material impact on
our revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. Approximately 43%, 36% and 24% of our

Costs applicable to sales

were paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. Our

Costs applicable to sales

are most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. We estimate that every $0.10 increase in the U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rate increases
annually the U.S. dollar

Costs applicable to sales

by approximately $90 for each ounce of gold sold from operations in Australia before taking into account the impact of currency hedging. However, variations in the Australian dollar/U.S.
dollar exchange rate historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Changes in costs at Australian locations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in
sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations. No assurance, however, can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Variations in foreign currency exchange rates increased

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce
$9, net of hedging, in 2011 compared to 2010, and increased

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce $10, net of hedging, in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to movements in the Australian dollar.

We hedge a portion of our forecasted Australian dollar denominated operating expenditures. At December 31, 2011, we have hedged 76%, 62%, 46%,
26% and 10% of our forecasted Australian denominated operating costs in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, at an average rate of 0.91, 0.92, 0.89, 0.87 and 0.89, respectively.

Foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves. However, if a sustained
weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, the amount of proven
and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced as certain proven and probable reserves may no longer be economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of
any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management’s long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. Future reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily result in reduced gold or copper sales and increased amortization and,
depending on the level of reduction, could also result in impairments of property, plant and mine development, mineral interests and/or goodwill.

See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” on page 83.

Net cash provided from continuing operations

was a record $3,591 in 2011, an increase of $411 from 2010 due to higher realized gold prices resulting in an increase in gold operating margin and a lower
increase in working capital of $443 (trade receivables, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities); partially offset by higher

resulting in a decrease in copper operating margin and lower gold and copper sales
volumes as discussed above in

Consolidated Financial Results.

The increase was also partially offset by higher investments in advanced projects of $157 and exploration of $132 and higher current income and mining tax expense of $148. Cash
flow provided from operations during 2010 was $3,180, an increase of $266 from 2009 due to higher realized gold and copper prices resulting in an increase in operating margins and increased consolidated copper sales volume; partially offset by

Financing Activities

Net cash provided from (used in) financing activities of continuing operations

was $(854) in 2011, compared to $(915) and $2,572 in 2010 and
2009, respectively, for the reasons explained below.

Proceeds from debt, net.

During 2011, we borrowed
$2,041 under our revolving credit facility and paid debt issuance costs of $30.

During 2009, we received proceeds from debt of $4,299,
including $1,756 under our revolving credit facility, $1,080 net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes due in 2039, $895 net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes due in 2019, $504 net proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes
due in 2012 and $64 from other credit facilities.

At December 31, 2011, $244 of the $2,500 revolving credit facility was used to
secure the issuance of letters of credit, primarily supporting reclamation obligations (see

“Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements”

below) and $33 was used in outstanding borrowings.

Repayment of debt

.    During 2011, we repaid $2,273 of debt, including repayment of $2,008 under our revolving credit
facility and scheduled debt repayments of $223 for our 8 5/8% debentures, $30 related to the sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant (classified as a capital lease) and $12 on other credit facilities and capital leases.

During 2010, we repaid $430 of debt, including pre-payment of the $220 remaining under the PTNNT project financing facility and $96 and $52 under
Yanacocha’s senior notes and credit facility, respectively, and scheduled debt repayments of $24 related to the sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant and $38 on other credit facilities and capital leases. During 2009, we repaid
$2,731 of debt, including $2,513 under our revolving credit facility, $86 for Batu Hijau project financing scheduled debt repayments, $72 for short-term borrowings at Batu Hijau, $24 related to the sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment

2014, $10 in 2015, $43 in 2016 and $3,039 thereafter. We expect to be able to fund maturities of debt from

Net cash provided by operating activities

, short-term investments, existing cash balances, available credit facilities and an expected
debt issuance in the first half of 2012.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we were in compliance with all required debt covenants and
other restrictions related to our debt agreements.

Proceeds from stock issuance, net.

We received proceeds
of $40, $60 and $1,278 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, from the issuance of common stock. In February 2009, we completed a public offering of 34,500,000 shares of common stock at $37 per share for net proceeds of $1,236.

Sale of noncontrolling interests.

In March 2010, November 2009 and December 2009, NTPBV completed the sale of 7%,
10% and 7%, respectively, of shares in PTNNT to a third party buyer. These transactions reduced our ownership interest in PTNNT to 31.5%. Cash proceeds from the 2010 and 2009 sales were $229 and $638, respectively, with our 56.25% share being $129
and $359, respectively, and the remaining balances paid to our NTPBV partner.

Acquisition of noncontrolling
interests.

In June 2010, PTPI, an unrelated noncontrolling shareholder of PTNNT, completed the sale of a 2.2% interest in PTNNT to PTIMI. To enable the transaction to proceed, we released our rights to the dividends
payable on this 2.2% interest and released our security interest in the associated shares. We agreed to advance certain funds to PTIMI to enable it to purchase the 2.2% interest in exchange for (i) a pledge of their share of PTNNT, (ii) an
assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax, and (iii) a commitment to support the application of Newmont standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine. The funds that we advanced to PTIMI and which it paid to PTPI
for the shares were used by PTPI to reduce its outstanding loan balance with us. Upon completion of this transaction, PTPI requested and was allowed to make additional draw-downs under our agreement with PTPI. Our economic interest in
PTPI’s and PTIMI’s combined 20% ownership interest in PTNNT remains at 17% and did not change as a result of these transactions.

In December 2009, we entered into a transaction with PTPI whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTPI in exchange for (i) a pledge of
its 20% share of PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax, (iii) a commitment to support the application of Newmont standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine, and (iv) as of
September 16, 2011, powers of attorney to vote and sell PTNNT shares in support of the pledge, enforceable in the event of default as further security for the funding. As a result, our effective economic interest in PTNNT increased by 17%.

Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests.

We paid dividends of $117, $462 and $394 to noncontrolling
interests during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The payments in 2011 included $15 of Indonesian withholding taxes related to dividends paid to noncontrolling interests in December 2010. The dividends paid in 2010 and 2009, included $100 and
$279, respectively, for our NTPBV partner’s share of the interest sold in Batu Hijau during those years.

Dividends paid to
common stockholders.

We paid annual dividends of $1.00, $0.50 and $0.40 per common share during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Additionally, Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited, a subsidiary of the Company,
paid annual dividends of C$1.00, C$0.52 and C$0.46 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. On February 22, 2012, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, payable March 30, 2012 to holders of record at the close of
business on March 15, 2012. Total dividends paid to common stockholders were $494, $246 and $196 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Discontinued Operations

Net operating cash provided from (used in) discontinued
operations

was $(7) in 2011, compared to $(13) and $33 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Discontinued operations in 2011 relate to payments on the Holt property royalty. The 2010 and 2009 amounts related to the Kori Kollo operation in Bolivia
which was sold in 2009.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations

was $2 in 2009 for
repayment of debt at Kori Kollo.

Corporate Revolving Credit Facility

Effective May 20, 2011, the Company entered into a new uncollateralized $2,500 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks.
This new revolving credit facility replaced the existing revolving credit facility which was cancelled upon the effectiveness of the new facility. The new facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars and contains a letter of credit sub-facility.
The new facility matures in May 2016. Facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company’s senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a market based rate plus a margin determined by the
Company’s credit rating. At December 31, 2011, we had $33 borrowings outstanding under the facility. There was $244 and $153 outstanding in letters of credit at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Subsidiary Financings

PTNNT Revolving Credit Facility

Effective May 27, 2011, PTNNT entered into a new $600 reducing revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. This new reducing revolving facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars. The facility
matures in March 2017. The facility is non-recourse to Newmont and substantially all of PTNNT’s assets are pledged as collateral. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 4.00%. Commitment
fees currently accrue on the daily average unused amount of the commitment of each lender at an annual rate of 2.00%. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2011.

Debt Covenants

The
Company’s senior notes and sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant debt facilities contain various covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, limitation on sales and leaseback agreements and
merger restrictions.

The Ahafo project facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total
debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income and mining taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of less than or equal to 4.0 and a net debt to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to
62.5%.

In addition to the covenants noted above, the corporate revolving credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring
the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5%. Furthermore, the corporate revolving credit facility contains covenants limiting the sale of all or
substantially all of the Company’s assets, certain change of control provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets.

At
December 31, 2011 and 2010, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and provisions related to potential defaults.

Shelf Registration Statement

In September 2009, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which enables the Company to issue an indeterminate number or amount of
common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate prices. It also included the resale of an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities from
time to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible securities.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Contractual Obligations

Our contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 are summarized as follows:

(1)

Amounts represent principal ($4,147) and estimated interest payments ($3,227) assuming no early extinguishment.

(2)

Amounts represent principal ($166) and estimated interest payments ($2) which includes the early buy-out option of the refractory ore treatment plant discussed
in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(3)

Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pursuant to environmental regulations, we are
required to close our operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these reclamation and remediation obligations are reflected here. For more information regarding
reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(4)

Contractual obligations for

Employee-related benefits

include severance, workers’ participation, pension and other benefit plans. Pension plan
benefit payments beyond 2016 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included.

(5)

We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of our uncertain income tax liabilities and interest payments beyond 2012 due to uncertainties in the timing of
the effective settlement of tax positions.

(6)

Purchase obligations are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for purchase of power,
materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects.

(7)

Other includes accrued Boddington contingent consideration of $54, the accrued Holt royalty of $176 and other obligations which are not reflected in our
Consolidated Financial Statements including labor and service contracts. Payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases (as disclosed in the above table) and $1,354 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees (see Note 31 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements).



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

We also have sales agreements to sell copper and gold concentrates at market prices as follows (in
thousands of tons):

For information regarding these copper sales agreements, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk-Hedging, Provisional Copper and Gold Sales, below.

Future Cash Flows

We anticipate significant future capital expenditures (see Investing Activities, above), funding of exploration and advanced projects, debt
repayments and dividends to both common shareholders and noncontrolling interests will impact

Net cash used in investing activities

and

Net cash used in financing activities

and exceed

Net cash provided by operations

. Our
ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices as well as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. We may
determine that it is necessary or appropriate to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects or sell assets. Additional financing may not be available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to
us and, if raised by offering equity securities, may involve substantial dilution to existing stockholders. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to
pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities, retire or service all outstanding debt and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. For information on our long-term debt, capital
lease obligations and operating leases, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2011, we entered into forward starting
swaps position amounts with a total notional value of $2,000. These swaps hedge movements in treasury rates related to an expected debt issuance in the first half of 2012. At December 31, 2011, the hedge contracts were in a liability position
of $399. The proceeds from the expected debt issuance will be impacted by the fair value of the swap contracts at the time of issuance. If the anticipated debt issuance does not proceed, we will be required to cash settle the swap contracts with the
full amount of the payment charged against earnings.

Cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the realized prices of gold
and copper. For information on the sensitivity of our

to metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar, particularly with
respect to the Australian dollar. Accordingly, we have entered into derivative instruments to reduce the volatility of

variations in our production profile alone to influence our ability to pay our debt and other obligations in 2012.

Environmental

Our mining and exploration activities are subject to
various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future
expenditures. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, $1,070 and $904, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently, recently producing or developmental stage mineral properties, of which $47 is classified as a current
liability. For more information on the Company’s reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $170 and $144 were
accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We spent $15, $23 and $20 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for environmental obligations related to former, primarily historic, mining activities, and have
classified $24 as a current liability. Expenditures for 2011 related primarily to the Con mine in Canada which was acquired as part of the Miramar acquisition, the Mt. Leyshon property in Australia, which is a legacy Normandy site and the Dawn mill
site in Washington State. Expenditures for 2010 related primarily to the Con mine in Canada, the Mt. Leyshon property in Australia, the Dawn mill site in Washington State and Resurrection, a mine site in Leadville, Colorado. Expenditures for 2009
related primarily to Grass Valley in California, the Mt. Leyshon property, the Dawn mill site and the Con mine. For more information on the Company’s obligations associated with former mining activities, see Note 31 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Included in capital expenditures were $172, $118 and $131 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to comply with
environmental regulations. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Non-GAAP financial measures are intended
to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of
performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted net income

Management of the Company uses

future business operations. The Company believes the use of

Adjusted net income

allows investors and analysts to compare results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production
and sale of minerals to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items. Management’s determination of the components of

Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound

Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales
of gold and copper by gold ounces or copper pounds sold, respectively. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on both a consolidated and attributable to Newmont basis. Attributable costs applicable to sales are
based on our economic interest in production from our mines. For operations where we hold less than a 100% economic share in the production, we exclude the share of gold or copper production attributable to the noncontrolling interest. We include
attributable costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound to provide management, investors and analysts with information with which to compare our performance to other gold producers. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound statistics are intended to
provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not
necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.

Net attributable costs applicable to sales per ounce measures the benefit of copper produced in conjunction with gold, as a credit against the cost of producing gold. A number of other gold producers present their
costs net of the contribution from copper and other non-gold sales. We believe that including a measure on this basis provides management, investors and analysts with information with which to compare our performance to other gold producers, and to
better assess the overall performance of our business. In addition, this measure provides information to enable investors and analysts to understand the importance of non-gold revenues to our cost structure.

QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (dollars in    millions except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Metal Price

Changes in the market price of gold and copper significantly affect our profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central
bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; the relative strength of the U.S. dollar and global mine production levels. Copper is traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and demand,
but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Foreign Currency

Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar may affect our profitability and cash flow. Foreign currency exchange
rates can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and U.S. currencies and U.S. and foreign country economic conditions. In addition to our operations in the United States, we have assets or operations in
Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Mexico, New Zealand and Canada. All of our operations sell their metal production based on U.S. dollar gold and copper prices. Fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can
increase or decrease profit margins and

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. The Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate has had the greatest impact on our

Costs
applicable to sales

, as measured in U.S. dollars. However, variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate have historically been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or
decreases in costs at Australian gold operations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in U.S. dollars for such locations. No assurance can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar
exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future, or that short-term changes in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will not have an impact on our profitability and cash flow. Foreign
currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves in the past. However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or
to other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, profitability, cash flows and the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable
foreign country could be reduced. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management’s long-term view of the applicable exchange
rate. For information concerning the sensitivity of our

Costs applicable to sales

to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial
Condition-Results of Consolidated Operations-Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above.

Hedging

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes in gold and copper prices by selling our production at spot market prices.
Consequently, we do not hedge our gold and copper sales. We have and will continue to manage certain risks associated with commodity input costs, interest rates and foreign currencies using the derivative market.

By using derivatives, we are affected by credit risk, market risk and market liquidity risk. Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail
to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. We mitigate credit risk by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties, limiting the amount of exposure to each counterparty, and monitoring the
financial condition of the counterparties. Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a derivative might be adversely affected by a change in underlying commodity prices, interest rates, or currency exchange rates, and that this in turn affects
our financial condition. We manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. We mitigate this potential risk to our financial condition by establishing trading
agreements with counterparties under which we are not required to post any collateral or make any margin calls on our derivatives. Our counterparties cannot require settlement solely because of an adverse change in the fair value of a derivative.
Market liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative cannot be eliminated quickly, by either liquidating it or by establishing an offsetting position. Under the terms of our trading agreements, counterparties cannot require us to immediately settle
outstanding derivatives, except upon the occurrence of customary events of default such as covenant breeches, including financial covenants, insolvency or bankruptcy. We further mitigate market liquidity risk by spreading out the maturity of our
derivatives over time.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Cash Flow Hedges

We utilize foreign currency contracts to reduce the variability of the US dollar amount of forecasted foreign currency expenditures caused by changes in exchange rates. We hedge a portion of our A$ and NZ$
denominated operating expenditures which results in a blended rate realized each period. The hedging instruments are fixed forward contracts with expiration dates ranging up to five years from the date of issue. The principal hedging objective is
reduction in the volatility of realized period-on-period $/A$ and $/NZ$ rates, respectively. We also utilize foreign currency contracts to hedge a portion of the Company’s A$ denominated capital expenditures related to the construction of the
Akyem project in Africa and the Tanami mine shaft in Australia. The hedging instruments are fixed forward contracts with expiration dates ranging up to three years. We use diesel contracts to reduce the variability of our operating cost exposure
related to diesel prices of fuel consumed at our Nevada operations. We utilize forward starting swap contracts to hedge against adverse movements in interest rates related to an expected debt issuance. All of the currency, diesel and forward
starting swap contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of future expenditures, and as such, changes in the market value have been recorded in

We had the following diesel derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010:



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Forward Starting Swap Contracts

In 2011, we entered into forward starting swap contracts with a total notional value of $2,000. These contracts hedge movements in treasury rates
related to an expected debt issuance. Subsequent to entering into the forward starting swap contracts, we revised our expected debt issuance date to the first half of 2012 and extended the terms of the forward starting swap contracts resulting in
the recognition of a $15 charge related to hedge ineffectiveness. At December 31, 2011, the hedge contracts were in a liability position of $399. The proceeds from the expected debt issuance will be adjusted by the fair value of the swap
contracts at the time of issuance. If the anticipated debt issuance does not proceed, we will be required to cash settle the swap contracts with the full amount of the payment charged against earnings.

Treasury Rate Lock Contracts

In connection with the 2019 and 2039 notes issued in September 2009, we acquired treasury rate lock contracts to reduce the variability of the proceeds realized from the bond issuances. The treasury rate locks
resulted in $6 and $5 unrealized gains in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

for the 2019 and 2039 notes, respectively. We previously acquired treasury rate locks in connection with the issuance of the 2035 notes that resulted in a $10
unrealized loss in

Fair Value Hedges

Interest Rate Risk

We had $222 fixed to floating swap contracts designated as a hedge against debt which matured in May 2011. The fair value of the interest rate swaps
was $3 at December 31, 2010.

Provisional Copper and Gold Sales

Our provisional copper and gold sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the gold
and copper concentrates at the prevailing indices’ prices at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement.

The average LME copper price was $4.00 per pound during 2011, compared with the Company’s recorded average provisional price of $4.02 before
mark-to-market losses and treatment and refining charges. During 2011, decreasing copper prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of $92 ($0.26 per pound). At December 31, 2011, Newmont had copper sales of 79 million
pounds priced at an average of $3.43 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. Each $0.10 change in the price for provisionally priced sales would have an approximate $3 effect on our

Net income attributable to Newmont
stockholders

.

The average London P.M. fix for gold was $1,572 per ounce during 2011, compared with the Company’s recorded
average provisional price of $1,567 per ounce before mark-to-market gains and treatment and refining charges. During 2011, increasing gold prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market gain of $31 ($5 per ounce). At December 31, 2011,
Newmont had gold sales of 85,000 ounces priced at an average of $1,576 per ounce, subject to final pricing over the next several months. Each $25 change in the price for provisionally priced gold sales would have an approximate $1 effect on our

Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders

NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Fixed and Variable Rate Debt

We have both fixed and variable rate debt. 98% and 99% of our debt portfolio was fixed rate debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
The carrying value of fixed rate debt slightly decreased primarily due to the repayment of the 2011 8 5/8% debentures, partially offset by note discount amortization. Our fixed rate debt exposure at December 31, 2011 and 2010 is summarized as
follows:

instruments include the Sale-Leaseback of the Refractory Ore Treatment Plant and certain capital leases. The estimated fair value quoted above may or may not reflect the actual trading value of these instruments.

(2)

The pro forma information assumes a +/–10 basis point change in market interest rates at December 31 of each year, and reflects the corresponding
estimated change in the fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. Actual changes in the timing and amount of interest rate variations may differ from the above assumptions.

ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the
Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and
principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2011.
In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

. Based upon its assessment,
management concluded that, at December 31, 2011, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The
effectiveness of the Company’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which
appears herein.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Newmont Mining Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2011, based
on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing
under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 1    THE COMPANY

Newmont Mining Corporation and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “Newmont” or the “Company”)
predominantly operates in the mining industry, focused on the exploration for and production of gold and copper. The Company has significant assets in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, New Zealand and Mexico. The cash
flow and profitability of the Company’s operations are significantly affected by the market price of gold, and to a lesser extent, copper. The prices of gold and copper are affected by numerous factors beyond the Company’s control.

References to “A$” refers to Australian currency, “C$” to Canadian currency, “NZ$” to New Zealand
currency, “IDR” to Indonesian currency and “$” to United States currency.

NOTE 2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of Estimates

The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated
Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash
flow estimates utilized in impairment calculations and units-of-production amortization calculations; environmental, reclamation and closure obligations; estimates of recoverable gold and other minerals in stockpile and leach pad inventories;
estimates of fair value for certain reporting units and asset impairments (including impairments of goodwill, long-lived assets and investments); write-downs of inventory, stockpiles and ore on leach pads to net realizable value; post-employment,
post-retirement and other employee benefit liabilities; valuation allowances for deferred tax assets; reserves for contingencies and litigation; and the fair value and accounting treatment of financial instruments including marketable securities and
derivative instruments. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results will differ from these amounts estimated in
these financial statements.

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Newmont Mining Corporation and more-than-50%-owned subsidiaries that it controls and
entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. The Company also includes its pro-rata share of assets, liabilities and operations for unincorporated joint ventures in which it has an interest. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The functional currency for the majority of the Company’s operations, including the Australian operations, is the U.S. dollar.

The Company follows

FASB Accounting Standards Codification

(“ASC”) guidance for identification and reporting of entities over which
control is achieved through means other than voting rights. The guidance defines such entities as Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”). The Company has identified VIEs in connection with our interests in PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara
(“PTNNT” or “Batu Hijau”) due to certain funding arrangements and shareholder commitments. The Company has financing arrangements with PT Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”) and PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama (“PTIMI”),
unrelated noncontrolling shareholders of PTNNT, whereby the Company agreed to advance certain funds to them in exchange for (i) a pledge of their combined 20% share of PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of
withholding tax, (iii) a commitment from them to support the



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

application of our standards to the operation of Batu Hijau and (iv) as of September 16, 2011 in respect of PTPI only, powers of attorney to vote and sell PTNNT shares in support of the
pledge, enforceable in an event of default as further security for the funding. The Company has determined itself to be the primary beneficiary of these entities and controls the operations of Batu Hijau, and therefore consolidates PTNNT in the
Company’s financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Because of
the short maturity of these investments, the carrying amounts approximate their fair value. Cash and cash equivalents are invested in United States Treasury securities and money market securities. Restricted cash is excluded from cash and cash
equivalents and is included in other current and long-term assets.

Investments

Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such
determinations at each reporting date. Investments in incorporated entities in which the Company’s ownership is greater than 20% and less than 50%, or which the Company does not control through majority ownership or means other than voting
rights, are accounted for by the equity method and are included in long-term assets. The Company accounts for its marketable security investments as available for sale securities in accordance with ASC guidance on accounting for certain investments
in debt and equity securities. The Company periodically evaluates whether declines in fair values of its investments below the Company’s carrying value are other-than-temporary in accordance with ASC guidance. The Company’s policy is to
generally treat a decline in the investment’s quoted market value that has lasted continuously for more than six months as an other-than-temporary decline in value. The Company also monitors its investments for events or changes in
circumstances that have occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment and evaluates qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss and the Company’s
ability to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs to determine if the decline in value of an investment is other-than-temporary. Declines in fair value below the Company’s carrying value deemed to be other-than-temporary are
charged to earnings.

Stockpiles, Ore on Leach Pads and Inventories

As described below, costs that are incurred in or benefit the productive process are accumulated as stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories.
Stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price of the product based on current and long-term metals prices, less the
estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. Write-downs of stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories to net realizable value are reported as a component of

Costs applicable to sales

. The current portion of
stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories is determined based on the expected amounts to be processed within the next 12 months. Stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories not expected to be processed within the next 12 months are classified
as long-term. The major classifications are as follows:

Stockpiles

Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the
number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data) and the estimated



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated to stockpiles based on relative values of
material stockpiled and processed using current mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable overhead and amortization relating to mining operations, and removed at each stockpile’s average cost per
recoverable unit.

Ore on Leach Pads

The recovery of gold from certain gold oxide ores is achieved through the heap leaching process. Under this method, oxide ore is placed on leach
pads where it is treated with a chemical solution, which dissolves the gold contained in the ore. The resulting gold-bearing solution is further processed in a plant where the gold is recovered. Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current
mining costs, including applicable amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad.

The estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the
leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each
year thereafter until the leaching process is complete.

Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are
reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the
metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, the Company’s operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual
recoverable quantities of gold on its leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a prospective
basis.

In-process Inventory

In-process inventories represent materials that are currently in the process of being converted to a saleable product. Conversion processes vary depending on the nature of the ore and the specific processing
facility, but include mill in-circuit, flotation, leach and carbon-in-leach in circuits. In-process material is measured based on assays of the material fed into the process and the projected recoveries of the respective plants. In-process
inventories are valued at the average cost of the material fed into the process attributable to the source material coming from the mines, stockpiles and/or leach pads plus the in-process conversion costs, including applicable amortization relating
to the process facilities incurred to that point in the process.

Precious Metals Inventory

Precious metals inventories include gold doré and/or gold bullion. Precious metals that result from the Company’s
mining and processing activities are valued at the average cost of the respective in-process inventories incurred prior to the refining process, plus applicable refining costs.

Concentrate inventories represent copper and gold concentrate available for shipment. The Company values concentrate inventory at the average cost,
including an allocable portion of support costs and amortization. Costs are added and removed to the concentrate inventory based on tons of concentrate and are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.

Materials and Supplies

Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Cost includes applicable taxes and freight.

Property, Plant and Mine Development

Facilities and
equipment

Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing
facilities or equipment are capitalized and recorded at cost. The facilities and equipment are amortized using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated productive lives, which do not exceed the related
estimated mine lives, of such facilities based on proven and probable reserves.

Mine Development

Mine development costs include engineering and metallurgical studies, drilling and other related costs to delineate an ore body,
the removal of overburden to initially expose an ore body at open pit surface mines and the building of access ways, shafts, lateral access, drifts, ramps and other infrastructure at underground mines. Costs incurred before mineralization is
classified as proven and probable reserves are expensed and classified as

Exploration

or

Advanced projects, research and development

expense. Capitalization of mine development project costs, that meet the definition of an asset,
begins once mineralization is classified as proven and probable reserves.

Drilling and related costs are capitalized for an ore body
where proven and probable reserves exist and the activities are directed at obtaining additional information on the ore body or converting non-reserve mineralization to proven and probable reserves. All other drilling and related costs are expensed
as incurred. Drilling costs incurred during the production phase for operational ore control are allocated to inventory costs and then included as a component of

Costs applicable to sales

.

The cost of removing overburden and waste materials to access the ore body at an open pit mine prior to the production phase are referred to as
“pre-stripping costs.” Pre-stripping costs are capitalized during the development of an open pit mine. Where multiple open pits exist at a mining complex utilizing common processing facilities, pre-stripping costs are capitalized at each
pit. The removal, production, and sale of de minimis saleable materials may occur during development and are recorded as

Other income

, net of incremental mining and processing costs.

The production phase of an open pit mine commences when saleable minerals, beyond a de minimis amount, are produced. Stripping costs incurred during
the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that are included as a component of inventory to be recognized in

Costs applicable to sales

in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory. The Company’s
definition of a mine and the mine’s production phase may differ from that of other companies in the mining industry resulting in incomparable allocations of stripping costs to deferred mine development and production costs. Other mining
companies may expense pre-stripping costs associated with subsequent pits within a mining complex.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Mine development costs are amortized using the units-of-production (“UOP”) method based
on estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves. To the extent that these costs benefit an entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated life of the ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas
that only provide benefit over the life of that area are amortized over the estimated life of that specific ore block or area.

Mineral Interests

Mineral interests include acquired interests in production, development and exploration stage properties. The mineral interests are capitalized at their fair value at the acquisition date, either as an individual
asset purchase or as part of a business combination.

The value of such assets is primarily driven by the nature and amount of
mineralized material believed to be contained in such properties. Production stage mineral interests represent interests in operating properties that contain proven and probable reserves. Development stage mineral interests represent interests in
properties under development that contain proven and probable reserves. Exploration stage mineral interests represent interests in properties that are believed to potentially contain mineralized material consisting of (i) mineralized material
such as inferred material within pits; measured, indicated and inferred material with insufficient drill spacing to qualify as proven and probable reserves; and inferred material in close proximity to proven and probable reserves;
(ii) around-mine exploration potential such as inferred material not immediately adjacent to existing reserves and mineralization, but located within the immediate mine area; (iii) other mine-related exploration potential that is not part
of measured, indicated or inferred material and is comprised mainly of material outside of the immediate mine area; (iv) greenfields exploration potential that is not associated with any other production, development or exploration stage
property, as described above; or (v) any acquired right to explore or extract a potential mineral deposit. The Company’s mineral rights generally are enforceable regardless of whether proven and probable reserves have been established. In
certain limited situations, the nature of a mineral right changes from an exploration right to a mining right upon the establishment of proven and probable reserves. The Company has the ability and intent to renew mineral interests where the
existing term is not sufficient to recover all identified and valued proven and probable reserves and/or undeveloped mineralized material.

Asset Impairment

The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of
the assets, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity
prices (considering current and historical prices, trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs, capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine plans. Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond
proven and probable reserves, including mineralization that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining
whether the assets are impaired. The term “recoverable minerals” refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of
recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management’s relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. The Company’s estimates of future cash
flows are based on numerous assumptions and it is possible that actual future cash flows will be significantly different than the estimates, as actual future quantities of recoverable minerals, gold and other commodity prices, production levels and
costs and capital are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized, net of treatment and refining charges, from a sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is
determinable, the product has been delivered, the title has been transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured. Revenues from by-product sales are credited to

Costs applicable to sales

as a by-product
credit.

Concentrate sales are initially recorded based on 100% of the provisional sales prices. Until final settlement occurs,
adjustments to the provisional sales prices are made to take into account the mark-to-market changes based on the forward prices for the estimated month of settlement. For changes in metal quantities upon receipt of new information and assay, the
provisional sales quantities are adjusted as well. The principal risks associated with recognition of sales on a provisional basis include metal price fluctuations between the date initially recorded and the date of final settlement. If a
significant decline in metal prices occurs between the provisional pricing date and the final settlement date, it is reasonably possible that the Company could be required to return a portion of the sales proceeds received based on the provisional
invoice.

The Company’s sales based on a provisional price contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the
host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward exchange price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market
through earnings each period prior to final settlement.

Income and Mining Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of
the Company’s liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. This method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for the Company, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect.
The Company derives its deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year. Mining taxes represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and
are classified as income taxes; as such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. With respect to the earnings that the Company derives from the operations of its consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the earnings are
indefinitely reinvested, no deferred taxes have been provided on the unremitted earnings (including the excess of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of such equity) of these
consolidated companies.

The Company’s deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. The Company records a
valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when it believes, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized.

The Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple
jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax
jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties,
the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an
additional charge to expense would result. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits
in

Income and mining tax expense

.

Reclamation and Remediation Costs

Reclamation obligations are recognized when incurred and recorded as liabilities at fair value. The liability is accreted over time through periodic
charges to earnings. In addition, the asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the asset’s carrying value and amortized over the life of the related asset. Reclamation costs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated
present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. The reclamation obligation is based on when spending for an existing disturbance will occur. The Company
reviews, on an annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary, the reclamation obligation at each mine site in accordance with ASC guidance for reclamation obligations.

Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on management’s best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where
applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency for the majority of the Company’s
operations, including the Australian operations, is the U.S. dollar. All monetary assets and liabilities where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are translated at current exchange rates and the resulting adjustments are included in

Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the period.

Derivative Instruments

Newmont has forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges in
place to hedge against changes in foreign exchanges rates and diesel prices, and forward starting swap contracts to hedge against changes in treasury rates. The fair value of derivative contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges are reflected as
assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. To the extent these hedges are effective in offsetting forecasted cash flows from production costs (the “effective portion”), changes in fair value are deferred in

. Amounts deferred in

are reclassified to income when the hedged transaction has occurred. The ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in

in each period. Cash transactions related to the Company’s derivative contracts accounted for as hedges are classified in the same category as the item being hedged in the statement of cash flows.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

When derivative contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges are settled, accelerated or restructured
before the maturity date of the contracts, the related amount in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

at the settlement date is deferred and reclassified to earnings, as applicable, when the originally designated hedged transaction impacts
earnings.

The fair value of derivative contracts qualifying as fair value hedges are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance
sheet. Changes in fair value are recorded in income in each period, consistent with recording changes to the mark-to-market value of the underlying hedged asset or liability in income. Prior to maturity in May 2011, changes in the mark-to-market
value of the effective portion of interest rate swaps utilized by the Company to swap a portion of its fixed rate interest rate risk to floating rate risk were recognized as a component of

.

Newmont assesses the effectiveness of the derivative contracts periodically using either regression analysis or the dollar offset approach, both
retrospectively and prospectively, to determine whether the hedging instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged items. The Company will also assess periodically whether the hedging instruments are
expected to be highly effective in the future. If a hedging instrument is not expected to be highly effective, the Company will stop hedge accounting prospectively. In those instances, the gains or losses remain in

until the hedged item affects earnings.

Net Income per Common Share

Basic and diluted income per share are presented for

Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders

and for

Income from continuing
operations attributable to Newmont stockholders

. Basic income per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of outstanding common shares for the period, including the exchangeable shares
(see Notes 14 and 23). Diluted income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts that may require the issuance of common shares in the future were converted. Diluted income per share is computed by
increasing the weighted-average number of outstanding common shares to include the additional common shares that would be outstanding after conversion and adjusting net income for changes that would result from the conversion. Only those securities
or other contracts that result in a reduction in earnings per share are included in the calculation.

Comprehensive Income

In addition to

Net income, Comprehensive income (loss)

includes all changes in equity during a period, such as
adjustments to minimum pension liabilities, foreign currency translation adjustments, the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and cumulative unrecognized changes in fair value of
marketable securities available-for-sale or other investments, except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Business Combinations

In December 2010, the ASC guidance for business combinations was updated
to clarify existing guidance which requires a public entity to disclose pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the
comparable prior annual period only. The update also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures required to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business
combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. Adoption of the updated guidance, effective for the



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2011, had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 15 for further
details regarding the Company’s acquisitions.

Fair Value Accounting

In January 2010, the ASC guidance for fair value measurements and disclosure was updated to require additional disclosures related to transfers in
and out of level 1 and 2 fair value measurements. The guidance was amended to clarify the level of disaggregation required for assets and liabilities and the disclosures required for inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of
assets and liabilities that fall in either level 2 or level 3. The updated guidance was effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2010. The adoption had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

Also in January 2010, the ASC guidance for fair value measurements and disclosure was updated to
require enhanced detail in the level 3 reconciliation. Adoption of the updated guidance, effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2011, had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 16 for further details regarding the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value.

Variable Interest Entities

In June 2009, the ASC guidance for consolidation accounting was
updated to require an entity to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s variable interest gives it a controlling financial interest in a VIE. This qualitative analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as
the entity that has both of the following characteristics: (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits
from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The updated guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Adoption of the updated guidance, effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
January 1, 2010, had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Goodwill Impairment

In September 2011, the ASC guidance was issued related to goodwill
impairment. Under the updated guidance, an entity will have the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step goodwill impairment test. If the Company believes, as a result of its qualitative
assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The update does not change how the Company
performs the two-step impairment test under current guidance. The update is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2012 with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the updated guidance to have an impact
on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Comprehensive Income

In June 2011, the ASC guidance was issued related to comprehensive income. Under the updated guidance, an entity will have the option to present the
total of comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In addition, the update required certain disclosure requirements when reporting other comprehensive



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

income. The update does not change the items reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to income. Subsequently, in December 2011,
the FASB issued its final standard to defer the new requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement. Companies will still be required to adopt the other requirements contained
in the new standard on comprehensive income. The Company adopted the new guidance and its deferral and opted to present the total of comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements effective for its fiscal year beginning
January 1, 2011. The early adoption had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Fair Value Accounting

In May 2011, the ASC guidance was issued related to disclosures around
fair value accounting. The updated guidance clarifies different components of fair value accounting including the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts, measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a
reporting entity’s shareholders’ equity and disclosing quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in fair value measurements that are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The update is effective for the
Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2012. The Company does not expect the updated guidance to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 3    SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company’s reportable segments are based upon the Company’s management structure that is focused on the geographic
region for the Company’s operations and include North America, South America, Asia Pacific, Africa and Corporate and Other. The Company’s major operations include Nevada, Yanacocha, Boddington, Batu Hijau, Other Australia/New Zealand and
Ahafo. The Company identifies its reportable segments as those consolidated mining operations or functional groups that represent more than 10% of the combined revenue, profit or loss or total assets of all reported operating segments. Consolidated
mining operations or functional groups not meeting this threshold are aggregated at the applicable geographic region or corporate level for segment reporting purposes. Earnings from operations do not reflect general corporate expenses, interest
(except project-specific interest) or income and mining taxes (except for equity investments). Intercompany revenue and

Revenues from export and domestic sales were as follows:

As gold can be sold through numerous gold market traders worldwide, the Company is not economically dependent on a
limited number of customers for the sale of its product. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, sales to Bank of Nova Scotia were $1,143 (13%), $2,435 (32%) and $2,658 (42%), respectively, of total gold sales. Additionally in 2011, the Company had sales to
Royal Bank of Scotland that totaled $2,048 (23%) of total gold sales.

Long-lived assets, excluding deferred tax assets, investments
and restricted cash, were as follows:

NOTE 4    RECLAMATION AND REMEDIATION

The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the
protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations to protect public health and the environment and believes its operations are in
compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.
Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010,
$1,070 and $904, respectively, were accrued for reclamation obligations relating to mineral properties. In addition, the Company is involved in several matters



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various
sites involved. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, $170 and $144, respectively, were accrued for such obligations. These amounts are also included in

Reclamation and remediation liabilities

Included in

Other long-term assets

at December 31, 2011 and 2010 is $11 and $12, respectively, of restricted cash that is legally
restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations related to the Con mine in Yellowknife, NWT, Canada. Included in

Investments

at December 31, 2011 and 2010 are $11 and $10 of long-term marketable debt securities,
respectively, and $4 and $6 long-term marketable equity securities, respectively, which are legally pledged for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations related to the San Jose Reservoir in Yanacocha.

The following is a reconciliation of reclamation and remediation liabilities:

Additions to the reclamation liability in 2011 of $176 include $139 for currently or recently producing properties
due mainly to increased water treatment costs and additional heap leach facilities at Yanacocha, an increase in the tailings area at Boddington, an expansion of the operating footprint at Batu Hijau and $37 for historic mining operations primarily
related to additional water management costs.

Additions to the reclamation liability in 2010 of $188 include $186 for currently or
recently producing properties due mainly to increased water treatment costs as a result of mine plan changes at Yanacocha, increased demolition costs at Boddington, an increase in the tailings area at Kalgoorlie, increased backfill at Phoenix,
increased activity at Hope Bay and $2 for historic mining operations primarily related to additional water management costs.

The current

NOTE 5    WRITE-DOWN OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND MINE DEVELOPMENT

Write-down of property, plant and mine development

totaled $2,084 in 2011, primarily due to an impairment
related to the Hope Bay project that resulted from the Company’s decision to place the project on care and maintenance and to focus on environmental and regulatory compliance spending. The Company placed the Hope Bay project on care and
maintenance after evaluating existing development options and economic feasibility for the project compared with other project and development opportunities within the Company’s wider project pipeline.

Pension and Other Benefit Plans

The Company provides defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees. Benefits are generally based on years of service and the employee’s
average annual compensation. Various international pension plans are based on local laws and requirements. Pension costs are determined annually by independent actuaries and pension contributions to the qualified plans are made based on funding
standards established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

The Company sponsors retiree health care
plans that provide prescription drug benefits to eligible retirees that our plans’ actuaries have determined are actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In 2010, Congress passed certain measures of healthcare reform which changed the
tax-free status of Medicare Part D subsidies and eliminated the impact on the post-retirement ABO.

The following tables provide a
reconciliation of changes in the plans’ benefit obligations and assets’ fair values for 2011 and 2010:

The Company’s qualified pension plans are funded with cash contributions in compliance with Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) rules and regulations. The Company’s non-qualified and other benefit plans are currently not funded, but exist as general corporate obligations. The information contained in

Significant assumptions were as follows:

Yield curves matching our benefit obligations were derived using a model based on high quality corporate bond data
from Bloomberg. The model develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds whose projected cash flows match the projected benefit payments of the plan. The resulting curves were used to identify a discount rate for
the Company of 5.35% and 5.75% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, based on the timing of future benefit payments. The decision to use 8% as the expected long-term return on plan assets for the three years ended December 2011 was made
based on an analysis of the actual plan asset returns over multiple time horizons and other comparable U.S. corporations. At December 31, 2011, Newmont decreased the expected long term return on plan assets to 7.75% in estimating its benefit
obligation, which will be used in determining future net periodic benefit cost. The decrease in the rate is a result of considering the most recent capital market forecasts and the plans’ current allocation as well as the actual return on plan
assets underperforming as compared to the expected return on assets in the last 5 years. The average actual return on plan assets during the 23 years ended December 31, 2011 approximated 8%.

The pension plans employ several independent investment firms which invest the assets of the plans in certain approved funds that correspond to
specific asset classes with associated target allocations. The goal of the pension fund investment program is to achieve prudent actuarial funding ratios while maintaining acceptable risk levels. The investment performance of the plans and that of
the individual investment firms is measured against recognized market indices. The performance of the pension funds are monitored by an investment committee comprised of members of the Company’s management, which is advised by an independent
investment consultant. With the exception of global capital market economic risks, the Company has identified no significant portfolio risks associated to



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

asset classes. The following is a summary of the target asset allocations for 2011 and the actual asset allocation at December 31, 2011.

The following table sets forth the Company’s pension plan assets measured at fair value by level within the
fair value hierarchy. Assets are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The pension plans’ cash and cash equivalents are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because
they are valued using quoted market prices. The cash equivalent instruments that are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets are primarily money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities.

The pension plans’ commingled fund investments are classified within Level 2. The funds are managed by several fund managers and are valued at
the net asset value per share for each fund. Although the majority of underlying assets in the funds consist of actively traded equity securities and bonds, the unit of account is considered to be at the fund level, and therefore, the investments
are classified as Level 2. At December 31, 2011, the underlying assets of the commingled funds consist of U.S. equity investments (35%), international equity investments (24%), fixed income investments (33%), and other investments (8%).

The assumed health care cost trend rate to measure the expected cost of benefits was 8.00% for 2012, 7.50% for 2013, 7.00% for 2014,
6.50% for 2015, 6.00% for 2016 and approximately 5.00% for each year thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on amounts

Savings Plans

The Company has two qualified defined contribution savings plans, one that covers salaried and non-union hourly employees and one that covers substantially all hourly union employees. In addition, the Company has
one non-qualified supplemental savings plan for salaried employees whose benefits under the qualified plan are limited by federal regulations. When an employee meets eligibility requirements, the Company matches 100% of employee contributions of up
to 6% of base salary for the salaried and hourly union plans. The Company makes a contribution between 5.0% and 7.5% (based on continuous years of service) to each non-union hourly employee’s retirement contribution account at its sole
discretion. Matching contributions are made with Newmont stock; however, no holding restrictions are placed on such contributions, which totaled $17 in 2011, $15 in 2010, and $15 in 2009.

NOTE 9    STOCK BASED COMPENSATION

The Company has stock incentive plans for executives and eligible employees. Stock incentive awards include options to purchase
shares of stock with exercise prices not less than fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant, restricted stock units, financial performance stock bonuses and performance leveraged stock units. At December 31, 2011,
8,809,298 shares were available for future stock incentive plan awards.

Employee Stock Options

Stock options granted under the Company’s stock incentive plans vest over periods of three years or more and are exercisable over a period of
time not to exceed 10 years from the grant date. The value of each option award is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions,
including the expected term of the option award and stock price volatility. The expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination experience. Expected volatility is based on
the historical volatility of our stock at the grant date. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize
expense for those options expected to vest. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our recorded stock based

Other Stock Based Compensation

The Company grants restricted stock units to executives and eligible employees upon achievement of certain financial and operating results.
Restricted stock units vest over periods of three years or more. Prior to vesting, holders of restricted stock units do not have the right to vote the underlying shares; however, executives accrue dividend equivalents on their restricted stock
units, which are paid at the time the restricted stock units vest. The restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture risk and other restrictions. Upon vesting, the employee is entitled to receive one share of the Company’s common stock for
each restricted stock unit. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company granted 586,944, 483,408 and 450,195 restricted stock units, respectively, at a weighted-average fair market value of $57, $52 and $42, respectively, per underlying share of the
Company’s common stock. At December 31, 2011, 537,282, 250,729 and 99,170 shares remain unvested for the 2011, 2010 and 2009 grants, respectively.

The Company grants financial performance stock bonuses to eligible executives upon achievement of certain financial and operating results, based on a targeted number of shares at the beginning of each performance
period. At the end of the performance period, one third of the bonus is paid in common stock and two-thirds of the bonus is paid in restricted stock units that vest in equal annual increments at the second and third anniversaries of the start of the
performance period. In 2011 and 2010, the Company granted 42,932 and 64,646 common shares, respectively, and 85,632 and 129,302 restricted stock units, respectively, included in the restricted stock unit grants above at a fair market value of $55
and $50 per underlying share of the Company’s common stock, respectively, under the financial performance stock bonus plan.

The
Company grants performance leveraged stock units (“PSUs”) to eligible executives, based upon certain measures of shareholder return. In 2011 and 2010, the Company granted 102,313 and 204,732, respectively, PSUs at a weighted-average fair
market value of $76 and $69, respectively. The actual number of PSUs that vest are determined at the end of a three year performance period (except two initial awards granted in 2010 that were based on a one and two year performance period). At
December 31, 2011, 102,313 and 145,601 remained unvested for the 2011 and 2010 PSU grants.

Prior to 2009, the Company granted
restricted stock awards to executives and deferred stock awards to eligible employees upon achievement of certain financial and operating results. Shares of restricted stock and deferred stock vest over periods of three years or more from the grant
date and are subject to certain restrictions related to ownership and transferability prior to vesting. In 2008, 218,697 shares of restricted stock, were granted at a weighted-average fair market value of $39 per underlying share of the
Company’s common stock. At December 31, 2011, 100,000 shares remained unvested for the 2008 restricted stock awards. In 2008, the Company granted 394,095 shares of deferred stock, at a weighted-average fair market value of $44 per
underlying share of the Company’s

common stock. At December 31, 2011, no awards shares remained unvested for the 2008 deferred stock awards.

The total intrinsic value of other stock based compensation awards that vested in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $33, $28 and $19, respectively. At December 31, 2011, there was $35 of unrecognized compensation costs
related to the unvested other stock based compensation awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2 years.

The Company recognized stock based compensation as follows:

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

The Company’s income and mining tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying
the United States statutory corporate income tax rate for the following reasons:

Factors that Significantly Impact Effective Tax Rate

The Company converted certain non-U.S. entities to U.S. entities for U.S. income tax purposes. As a result of the elections, the subsidiaries are
treated as flow-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The restructurings in 2011 and 2010 resulted in the recording of a deferred tax asset, calculated as the difference between fair market valuations of the subsidiaries compared to
the underlying financial statement basis in the assets.

Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion that may exceed
our tax basis in our mineral reserves) are available to us under the income tax laws of the United States for operations conducted in the United States or through branches and partnerships owned by U.S. subsidiaries included in our consolidated
United States income tax return. The deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold and other minerals produced by the Company.

The Company reviews the measurement of its deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date. All available evidence, both positive and negative, is
considered in determining whether, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company increased the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets
by $542 during 2011. The impairments of the Hope Bay project and specific marketable equity securities increased the valuation allowance $223 and $33, respectively. In addition, $274 of the increase in valuation allowance is a result of the tax
re-consolidation of the Australian group. This valuation allowance relates to the Australian tax step-up in basis allocated to capital assets. During 2011, $32 of valuation allowance on foreign tax credits was released and recorded directly to
equity. The remaining $10 valuation allowance on foreign tax credits, when released will also be recorded directly to equity. The valuation allowance remaining at the end of 2011 primarily is attributable to non-U.S. subsidiaries tax loss
carryforwards and capital assets.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company reclassified certain income based state and provincial
taxes from

Costs applicable to sales to Income and mining tax expense

. Tax expense increased due to the inclusion of such taxes as

. The reclassification resulted in $42,

Components of the Company’s deferred income tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

Net deferred income tax assets and liabilities consist of:

Company’s Unrecognized Tax Benefits

At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company had $336, $116 and $130 of total gross unrecognized tax benefits, respectively. A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, $137, $45 and $63, respectively, represent the amount of unrecognized tax
benefits that, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective income tax rate.

The Company operates in numerous countries
around the world and accordingly it is subject to, and pays annual income taxes under, the various income tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government,
and others are defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country. The Company has historically filed, and continues to file, all required income tax returns and paid the taxes reasonably determined to be due. The tax rules and
regulations in many countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. From time to time, the Company is subject to a review of its historic income tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing
authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules to the Company’s business conducted within the country involved.

On April 27, 2009, the United States Tax Court issued a decision in favor of Santa Fe, with respect to the $65 million Homestake break-up fee
deducted by Santa Fe in tax year 1997. Following procedural rules, the Internal Revenue Service was given 90 days from the date the decision was entered in which to file an appeal. The entry of decision was made on July 16, 2009. The Internal
Revenue Service did not file an appeal, and as a result, as of October 15, 2009 the decision stands. The result of this decision resulted in overpayments for each of the tax years 1994 through 1997. The Company has adjusted the unrecognized tax
benefits accordingly.

In 2010, PTNNT, the Company’s partially owned subsidiary in Indonesia, received a final tax assessment from
the Indonesian Tax Office. Although required to pay $132 (of which, $119 related to corporate income tax matters) of tax and penalties upon receipt of the tax assessment, PTNNT intends to vigorously defend its positions through all processes
available to it. PTNNT believes it is more likely than not that they will prevail based on prior experience and therefore recorded a corresponding receivable in the third quarter of 2010.

During the year, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued a Technical Advice Memorandum (“TAM”) to the Company regarding the U.S. income
tax treatment of the Price Capped Forward Sales Contracts settled in cash in 2007. The TAM provides guidance which is unfavorable to the Company. The Company intends to vigorously defend its positions through all processes available to it and
believes it should prevail.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction,
and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2005. As a result of (i) statute of
limitations that will begin to expire within the next 12 months in various jurisdictions, and (ii) possible settlements of audit-related issues with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions with respect to which none of the issues are
individually significant, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of its net unrecognized income tax benefits will decrease between $25 to $30 in the next 12 months.

The Company’s continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its income and
mining tax expense. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the total amount of accrued income-tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $11 and $10, respectively. During 2011, the Company recorded through the
Statements of Consolidated Income an additional $1 of interest and penalties. During 2010, the Company released through the Statements of Consolidated Income an additional $4 of interest and penalties. During 2009, the Company accrued through the
Statements of Consolidated Income an additional $9 of interest and penalties.

Tax Loss Carryforwards, Foreign Tax Credits, and
AMT Credits

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had (i) $1,051 and $1,220 of net operating loss carry forwards,
respectively; and (ii) $259 and $168 of tax credit carry forwards, respectively. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, $315 and $857, respectively, of net operating loss carry forwards are attributable to operations in Australia, Ghana and France
for which current tax law provides no expiration period. The remaining net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2030. Valuation allowances have been recorded on net operating loss carryforwards where the Company believes
based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that the net operating losses will not be realized.

Tax credit carry forwards
for 2011 and 2010 of $155 and $53 consist of foreign tax credits available in the United States; substantially all such credits not utilized will expire at the end of 2018. Other credit carry forwards at the end of 2011 and 2010 in the amounts of
$104 and $115, respectively, represent alternative minimum tax credits attributable to the Company’s U.S. operations for which the current tax law provides no period of expiration.

Differences in tax rates and other foreign income tax law variations make the ability to fully utilize all available foreign income tax credits on a
year-by-year basis highly dependent on the price of the gold and copper produced by the Company and the costs of production, since lower prices or higher costs can result in having insufficient sources of taxable income in the United States to
utilize all available foreign tax credits. Such credits have limited carry back and carry forward periods and can only be used to reduce the United States income tax imposed on foreign earnings included in the annual United States consolidated
income tax return.

Other

Newmont intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from certain foreign operations. Accordingly, U.S. and non-U.S. income and withholding taxes for which deferred taxes might otherwise be required, have not been
provided on a cumulative amount of temporary differences (including, for this purpose, any difference between the tax basis in the stock of a consolidated subsidiary and the amount of the subsidiary’s net equity determined for financial
reporting purposes) related to investments in foreign subsidiaries of approximately $8 and $7 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Euronimba Ltd.

Newmont holds a 43.50% interest in Euronimba Ltd. (“Euronimba”), with the remaining interests held by BHP Billiton (43.50%) and Areva
(13%). Euronimba owns 95% of the Nimba iron ore project located in the Republic of Guinea which is in the early stages of development.

AGR Matthey Joint Venture

The AGR Matthey Joint Venture (“AGR”), a gold refinery, in which Newmont held a 40% interest, was dissolved on March 30, 2010. Newmont received consideration of $14 from the dissolution and recorded
a gain of $6 during 2010. Newmont received dividends of $7 and $2 during 2010 and 2009, respectively, from its interests in AGR. See also Note 26 for details of Newmont’s transactions with AGR.

NOTE 12    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Discontinued operations include Holloway Mining Company, which owned the Holt-McDermott property (“Holt property”) that
was sold to St. Andrew Goldfields Ltd. (“St. Andrew”) in 2006. In 2009, the Superior Court issued a decision finding Newmont Canada Corporation (“Newmont Canada”) liable for a sliding scale royalty on production from the Holt
property, which Newmont Canada appealed. In 2010, the Company recognized a $28 charge, net of tax benefits of $12, related to these legal claims. In 2011, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the Superior Court ruling resulting in an additional $136
charge, net of tax benefits of $7.

In July 2009, the Company sold its interest in Kori Kollo in Bolivia. As part of the transaction, a
reclamation trust fund was established with the proceeds to be made available exclusively to pay for closure and reclamation costs when operations eventually cease. The Company recognized a $16 charge in 2009, net of tax benefits of $27, related to
the sale.

Newmont has accounted for these dispositions in accordance with accounting guidance for the impairment or disposal of

agreed

to advance certain funds to PTIMI to enable it to purchase the interest in exchange for (i) a pledge of their 2.2% share of PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares,
net of withholding tax, and (iii) a commitment from them to support the application of Newmont standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine. The funds that the Company advanced to PTIMI and which it paid to PTPI for the shares were used by
PTPI to reduce its outstanding loan balance with the Company. Upon completion of this transaction, PTPI requested and was allowed to borrow additional funds under the Company’s agreement with PTPI. The Company’s economic interest in
PTPI’s and PTIMI’s combined 20% interest in PTNNT remains at 17% and did not change as a result of these transactions.

In
March 2010, the Company (through Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V. (“NTPBV”)) completed the sale and transfer of shares for a 7% interest in PTNNT to PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”) in compliance with divestiture obligations
under the Contract of Work, reducing NTPBV’s ownership interest to 56% from 63%. In 2009, the Company (through NTPBV) completed the sale and transfer of shares for a 17% interest in PTNNT to PTMDB in compliance with divestiture obligations
under the Contract of Work, reducing NTPBV’s ownership interest to 63% from 80%. The 2010 and 2009 share transfers resulted in gains of approximately $16 (after tax of $33) and $63 (after tax of $115), respectively, that were recorded as

In December 2009, the Company entered into a transaction with PTPI, whereby the Company agreed to advance certain funds to PTPI in exchange for a
pledge of the noncontrolling shareholder’s 20% stake in PTNNT; an assignment of dividends on the shares, net of withholding tax; a commitment from PTPI to support the application of Newmont’s standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau
mine; and as of September 16, 2011 powers of attorney to vote and sell PTNNT shares in support of the pledge. Based on the transaction with PTPI, the Company recognized an additional 17% effective economic interest in PTNNT.

At December 31, 2011, Newmont had a 48.50% effective economic interest in PTNNT. Based on ASC guidance for variable interest entities, Newmont
continues to consolidate PTNNT in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Treasury Stock

Treasury stock is acquired by the Company when certain restricted stock awards vest or are forfeited. At vesting, a participant has a tax liability and, pursuant to the participant’s award agreement, may elect
withholding of restricted stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The withheld or forfeited stock is accounted for as treasury stock and carried at the par value of the related common stock.

Exchangeable Shares

In connection with the acquisition of Franco-Nevada Corporation (“Franco”) in February 2002, certain holders of Franco common stock
received 0.8 of an exchangeable share of Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited (formerly Franco) for each share of common stock held. These exchangeable shares are convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of Newmont common stock
on a one-for-one basis, and entitle holders to dividends and other rights economically equivalent to holders of Newmont common stock. On December 15, 2011, as a result of a plan of arrangement, holders of exchangeable shares received, at their
election, for each existing exchangeable share, one new exchangeable share of Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited or one share of Newmont common stock. In connection with the plan of arrangement, 1.6 million shares were converted from
exchangeable shares to Newmont common stock and 4.9 million new exchangeable shares were issued. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the value of the remaining exchangeable shares was included in

Net Income per Common Share

Basic income per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted income per common share is computed
similarly to basic income per common share except that the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares
had been issued.

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Options to purchase 2 million, 2 million and 4 million shares of common stock at
average exercise prices of $58, $57 and $47 were outstanding at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted weighted average common shares because their effect would have been
anti-dilutive.

In February 2009 and July 2007, Newmont issued $518 and $1,150, respectively, of Convertible Senior Notes that, if
converted in the future, may have a dilutive effect on the Company’s weighted average number of common shares. The notes issued in 2009 and 2007 are convertible, at the holder’s option, equivalent to a conversion price of $45.73
(11,316,422 shares of common stock) and $45.68 (25,175,131 shares of common stock), respectively, per share of common stock. Under the convertible note indenture, Newmont is required to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes in
cash and may elect to settle the remaining conversion obligation (Newmont average share price in excess of the conversion price), if any, in cash, shares or a combination thereof. The effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted
earnings per share is calculated under the net share settlement method in accordance with ASC guidance. The average price of the Company’s common stock for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 exceeded the conversion price for the
notes issued in 2009 and 2007, respectively, and therefore, 8 and 6 million shares additional shares were included in the computation of diluted weighted average common shares for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

In connection with the 2007 Convertible Senior Notes offering, the Company entered into Call Spread Transactions which included the
purchase of call options and the sale of warrants. As a result of the Call Spread Transactions, the conversion price of $45.68 was effectively increased to $59.59. Should the warrant transactions become dilutive to the Company’s earnings per
share (Newmont’s average share price exceeds $59.59) the effect of the warrant transactions on diluted earnings per share will be calculated in accordance with the net share settlement method.

NOTE 16    FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING

Fair value accounting establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair
value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the
fair value hierarchy are described below:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Level 2

Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and

Level 3

Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).

The following table sets forth the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at
least annually) by level within the fair value hierarchy. As required by accounting guidance, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The Company’s cash equivalent instruments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because
they are valued using quoted market prices. The cash equivalent instruments that are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets are primarily money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities.

The Company’s marketable equity securities are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and as such are classified within Level 1
of the fair value hierarchy. The securities are segregated based on industry. The fair value of the marketable equity securities is calculated as the quoted market price of the marketable equity security multiplied by the quantity of shares held by
the Company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

The Company’s marketable debt securities include investments in auction rate securities and
asset backed commercial paper. The Company reviews the fair value for auction rate securities and asset backed commercial paper on at least a quarterly basis. The auction rate securities are traded in markets that are not active, trade infrequently
and have little price transparency. The Company estimated the fair value of the auction rate securities based on weighted average risk calculations using probabilistic cash flow assumptions. The Company estimated the fair value of the asset backed
commercial paper using a probability of return to each class of notes reflective of information reviewed regarding the separate classes of securities. The auction rate securities and asset backed commercial paper are classified within Level 3 of the
fair value hierarchy. The Company’s corporate marketable debt securities are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and as such are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company’s net trade receivable from provisional copper and gold concentrate sales, subject to final pricing, is valued using quoted market
prices based on forward curves and, as such, is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company’s derivative
instruments are valued using pricing models and the Company generally uses similar models to value similar instruments. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit spreads, measures
of volatility, and correlations of such inputs. The Company’s derivatives trade in liquid markets, and as such, model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgment. Such instruments are classified within
Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The estimated fair value of the Boddington contingent royalty was determined using a Monte Carlo
valuation model which simulates future gold and copper prices and costs applicable to sales to estimate fair value. At December 31, 2011, the Company used the following long-term assumptions: 1) $1,500 per ounce gold price, 2) $3.50 per pound
copper price, 3) $90 per barrel of oil, and 4) a $1.00 A$/US$ exchange rate. The Company used a 4% discount rate in the model. The contingent royalty liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The estimated fair value of the Holt sliding scale royalty was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model to simulate future gold prices
utilizing a $1,500 per ounce gold price long-term assumption, various gold production scenarios based on publicly available reserve and resource information for the Holt property and a 4% weighted average discount rate. The sliding scale royalty
liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value,
on a recurring basis, of the Company’s Level 3 financial assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2011:



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

At December 31, 2011, the assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy represent 1% and 37% of the total assets and liabilities measured at fair value, on a recurring basis.

The following table
provides information related to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods after initial recognition. At December 31, 2011, Newmont recorded an impairment of $2,097 related to its Hope Bay project.
The Hope Bay assets were impaired based on a decision to place the project on care and maintenance. This write-down was recorded using Level 3 inputs, based on the income approach; whereby, Newmont considered the estimated recoverable value, net of
transportation and selling costs, of the related assets at Hope Bay.

NOTE 17    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Company’s strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes in gold and copper prices by selling its
production at spot market prices. Consequently, the Company does not hedge its gold and copper sales. Newmont manages certain risks associated with commodity input costs, treasury rates and foreign currencies using the derivative market. All of the
cash flow and fair value derivative instruments described below were transacted for risk management purposes and qualify as hedging instruments. The maximum period over which hedged transactions are expected to occur is five years.

Cash Flow Hedges

The foreign currency, diesel and forward starting swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, and as such, the effective
portion of unrealized changes in market value have been recorded in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

and are reclassified to income during the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains
and losses from hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings

.

Foreign Currency
Contracts

Newmont utilizes foreign currency contracts to reduce the variability of the US dollar amount of forecasted foreign
currency expenditures caused by changes in A$ and NZ$ exchange rates. Newmont hedges a portion of the Company’s A$ and NZ$ denominated operating expenditures to realize a blended exchange rate each period. The hedging instruments are fixed
forward contracts with expiration dates ranging up to five years from the date of issue.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

In June 2011, Newmont began hedging a portion of the Company’s A$ denominated capital
expenditures related to the construction of the Akyem project in Africa. The hedging instruments are fixed forward contracts with expiration dates ranging up to two years.

In July 2011, Newmont began hedging a portion of the Company’s A$ denominated capital expenditures related to the construction of a mine shaft at its Tanami operations in Australia. The hedging instruments are
fixed forward contracts with expiration dates ranging up to three years.

Newmont had the following foreign currency derivative
contracts outstanding at December 31, 2011:

Diesel Fixed Forward Contracts

Newmont hedges a portion of its operating cost exposure related to diesel consumed at its Nevada operations to reduce the variability in realized diesel prices. The hedging instruments consist of a series of
financially settled fixed forward contracts with expiration dates ranging up to three years from the date of issue.

Newmont had the
following diesel derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2011:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Forward Starting Swap Contracts

During 2011, Newmont entered into forward starting swap contracts with a total notional value of $2,000. These swaps hedge movements in treasury
rates related to an expected debt issuance. The Company subsequently revised its expected debt issuance date to the first half of 2012 and extended the terms of the forward starting swap contracts, resulting in the recognition of $15 in charges
related to hedge ineffectiveness in 2011. At December 31, 2011, the hedge contracts were in a liability position of $399. The proceeds from the expected debt issuance will be adjusted by the fair value of the swap contracts at the time of
issuance.

Treasury Rate Lock Contracts

In connection with the 2019 and 2039 notes issued in September 2009, Newmont acquired treasury rate lock contracts to reduce the variability of the proceeds realized from the bond issuances. The treasury rate locks
resulted in $6 and $5 unrealized gains in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

for the 2019 and 2039 notes, respectively. The Company previously acquired treasury rate locks in connection with the issuance of the 2035 notes that resulted in
a $10 unrealized loss in

Fair Value Hedges

Interest Rate Swap Contracts

Newmont had $222 fixed to floating swap contracts designated as a hedge against debt which matured in May 2011.

Provisional Copper and Gold Sales

The Company’s provisional copper and gold sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for
accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the gold and copper concentrates at the prevailing indices’ prices at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to
market through earnings each period prior to final settlement.

The average LME copper price was $4.00 per pound during 2011, compared
with the Company’s recorded average provisional price of $4.02 before mark-to-market losses and treatment and refining charges. During 2011, decreasing copper prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of $92 ($0.26 per
pound). At December 31, 2011, Newmont had copper sales of 79 million pounds priced at an average of $3.43 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months.

The average London P.M. fix for gold was $1,572 per ounce during 2011, compared with the Company’s recorded average provisional price of $1,567
per ounce before mark-to-market gains and treatment and refining charges. During 2011, increasing gold prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market gain of $31 ($5 per ounce). At December 31, 2011, Newmont had gold sales of 85,000
ounces priced at an average of $1,576 per ounce, subject to final pricing over the next several months.

In conjunction with the April 6, 2011 acquisition of Fronteer, Newmont acquired $208 of Paladin Energy Ltd.
securities and $73 of other marketable equity securities which were subsequently impaired for other-than-temporary declines in value resulting in charges of $148 for Paladin Energy Ltd. and $32 for other marketable equity securities.

In 2011, Newmont sold its investment in New Gold Inc. and realized a gain of $50 and sold other marketable equity securities and realized a gain of
$14.

In 2010, AGR, in which the Company held a 40% equity interest, was dissolved and the Company received consideration of $14 and
recorded a gain of $6. During 2010, the Company recognized impairments for other-than-temporary declines in value of $1 for other marketable equity securities.

aggregated by length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position:

Included in the tables above are the unrealized losses of $26 and $8 at December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively, related to the Company’s investments in asset backed commercial paper, auction rate securities and marketable equity securities. While the fair values of these investments are below their respective cost, the Company views these
declines as temporary. The Company intends to hold its investment in auction rate securities and asset backed commercial paper until maturity or such time that the market recovers and therefore considers these losses temporary.

NOTE 19    INVENTORIES

The Company recorded aggregate write-downs of $27, $9, and $9 for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, to reduce the
carrying value of material and supply inventories to net realizable value. $17 of the write-downs in 2011 are related to the Hope Bay project and are classified as a component of

matures in March 2017. The facility is non-recourse to Newmont and substantially all of PTNNT’s assets are pledged as collateral. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 4.00%. Commitment
fees currently accrue on the daily average unused amount of the commitment of each lender at an annual rate of 2.00%. A one-time arrangement fee of $18 related to the facility was capitalized as debt issuance cost during 2011 and will be amortized
over the term of the debt. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2011.

2012 Convertible
Senior Notes

In February 2009, the Company issued $518 of uncollateralized convertible senior notes maturing on
February 15, 2012 for net proceeds of $504. The notes pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.0% per annum and the effective interest rate is 8.5%. The notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, equivalent to a conversion price
of $45.73 per share of common stock. Upon conversion, the principal amount and all accrued interest will be repaid in cash. In December 2011, the Company provided notice that it will settle the conversion premium in cash. The Company is not entitled
to redeem the notes prior to their stated maturity dates. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of these senior notes was $674 and $668 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The foregoing fair
value estimates were prepared with the assistance of an independent third party and may or may not reflect the actual trading value of this debt.

2014 and 2017 Convertible Senior Notes

In July 2007, the Company issued $1,150
uncollateralized convertible senior notes due in 2014 and 2017, each with a principal amount of $575 for net proceeds of $1,126. The 2014 notes, maturing on July 15, 2014, pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.25% per annum, and the
2017 notes, maturing on July 15, 2017, pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.63% per annum. The effective interest rates are 6.0% and 6.25% for the 2014 and 2017 notes, respectively. The notes are convertible, at the holder’s
option, at a conversion price of $45.68 per share of common stock. Upon conversion, the principal amount and all accrued interest will be repaid in cash and any conversion premium will be settled in shares of our common stock or, at our election,
cash or any combination of cash and shares of our common stock. In connection with the convertible senior notes offering, the Company entered into Call Spread Transactions. The Call Spread Transactions included the purchase of call options and the
sale of warrants. As a result of the Call Spread Transactions, the conversion price of $45.68 was effectively increased to $59.59. The Company is not entitled to redeem the notes prior to their stated maturity dates. Using prevailing interest rates
on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of the 2014 and 2017 senior notes was $713 and $651, respectively, at December 31, 2011 and $697 and $627, respectively, at December 31, 2010. The foregoing fair value estimates were

NOTE 31    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

General

The Company follows ASC guidance in determining its accruals and disclosures with respect to loss contingencies. Accordingly, estimated losses from loss contingencies are accrued by a charge to income when
information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable (greater than a 75% probability) that a liability could be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal expenses associated
with the contingency are expensed as incurred. If a loss contingency is not probable or reasonably estimable, disclosure of the loss contingency is made in the financial statements when it is at least reasonably possible that a material loss could
be incurred.

Operating Segments

The Company’s operating segments are identified in Note 3. Except as noted in this paragraph, all of the Company’s commitments and contingencies specifically described in this Note 31 relate to the
Corporate and Other reportable segment. The PT Newmont Minahasa Raya and PTNNT matters relate to the Asia Pacific reportable segment. The Yanacocha matters relate to the South America reportable segment.

Environmental Matters

The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These
laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations are in compliance with applicable laws and
regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.

Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, $1,070 and $904,
respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently producing mineral properties in accordance with asset retirement obligation guidance. The current portions of $47 and $46 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are
included in

Other current liabilities

.

In addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental
obligations associated with former mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. The Company believes that the related environmental obligations associated with these
sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the compliance required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon the Company’s best estimate of its liability for these matters,
$170 and $144 were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These amounts are included in

Other current liabilities

and

Reclamation and remediation liabilities

. Depending upon the ultimate
resolution of these matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 122% greater or 8% lower than the amount accrued at December 31, 2011. The amounts accrued for these

Details about certain of the more significant matters involved are discussed below.

Dawn Mining Company LLC (“Dawn”) — 51% Newmont Owned

Midnite Mine Site.

Dawn previously leased an open pit uranium mine, currently inactive, on the Spokane Indian
Reservation in the State of Washington. The mine site is subject to regulation by agencies of the U.S. Department of Interior (the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land Management), as well as the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (“EPA”).

In 1991, Dawn’s mining lease at the mine was terminated. As a result, Dawn was required to file a formal
mine closure and reclamation plan. The Department of Interior commenced an analysis of Dawn’s proposed plan and alternate closure and reclamation plans for the mine. Work on this analysis has been suspended indefinitely. In mid-2000, the mine
was included on the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). In March 2003, the EPA notified Dawn and Newmont that it had thus far expended $12 on the Remedial
Investigation/Feasibility Study (“RI/FS”) under CERCLA. In October 2005, the EPA issued the RI/FS on this property in which it indicated a preferred remedy. Newmont and Dawn filed comments on the RI/FS with the EPA in January 2006. On
October 3, 2006, the EPA issued a final Record of Decision in which it formally selected the preferred remedy identified in the RI/FS.

On January 28, 2005, the EPA filed a lawsuit against Dawn and Newmont under CERCLA in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. The EPA has asserted that Dawn and Newmont are liable for
reclamation or remediation work and costs at the mine. Dawn does not have sufficient funds to pay for the reclamation plan it proposed or for any alternate plan, or for any additional remediation work or costs at the mine.

On July 14, 2008, after a bench trial, the Court held Newmont liable under CERCLA as an “operator” of the Midnite Mine. The Court
previously ruled on summary judgment that both the U.S. Government and Dawn were liable under CERCLA. On October 17, 2008, the Court issued its written decision in the bench trial. The Court found Dawn and Newmont jointly and severally liable
under CERCLA for past and future response costs, and ruled that each of Dawn and Newmont are responsible to pay one-third of such costs. The Court also found the U.S. Government liable on Dawn’s and Newmont’s contribution claim, and ruled
that the U.S. Government is responsible to pay one-third of all past and future response costs. In November 2008, all parties appealed the Court’s ruling. Also in November 2008, the EPA issued an Administrative Order pursuant to
Section 106 of CERCLA ordering Dawn and Newmont to conduct water treatment, testing and other preliminary remedial actions. Newmont has initiated those preliminary remedial actions.

As of September 30, 2011, Newmont, Dawn, the Department of Interior, the EPA and the Department of Justice entered into a Consent Decree for
remediation of the Midnite Mine site, and filed the Consent Decree with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. All parties moved to dismiss the appeal of the trial court findings. The Court elicited public comments regarding
the Consent Decree and approved the Consent Decree on January 17, 2012. According to the Consent Decree: 1) Newmont and Dawn will design, construct and implement the cleanup plan selected by the EPA in 2006 for the Midnite Mine site; 2) Newmont
and Dawn will reimburse the EPA for its costs associated with overseeing the work; 3) the Department of the Interior will contribute a lump sum of approximately $54 toward past EPA costs and future costs related to the cleanup of the Midnite Mine
site; 4) Newmont and Dawn will be responsible for all other EPA oversight costs and Midnite Mine site cleanup costs; and 5) Newmont will post a surety bond for work at the site. At December 31, 2011, Newmont had accrued approximately $65 for
the Midnite Mine site reclamation.

Dawn Mill Site.

Dawn also owns a uranium mill site facility, located
on private land near Ford, Washington, which is subject to state and federal regulation. In late 1999, Dawn sought and later received approval from the State of Washington for a revised closure plan that expedites the reclamation process at the
site. The currently approved plan for the site is guaranteed by Newmont.

Newmont USA Limited — 100% Newmont
Owned

Grey Eagle Mine Site

.    By letter dated September 3, 2002, the EPA notified
Newmont that the EPA had expended $3 in response costs to address environmental conditions associated with a historic tailings pile located at the Grey Eagle Mine site near Happy Camp, California, and requested that Newmont pay those costs. The EPA
has identified four potentially responsible parties, including Newmont. Newmont does not believe it has any liability for environmental conditions at the Grey Eagle Mine site, and intends to vigorously defend any formal claims by the EPA. Newmont
cannot reasonably predict the likelihood or outcome of any future action against it arising from this matter.

Ross-Adams Mine
Site.

By letter dated June 5, 2007, the U.S. Forest Service notified Newmont that it had expended approximately $0.3 in response costs to address environmental conditions at the Ross-Adams mine in Prince of Wales,
Alaska, and requested Newmont USA Limited pay those costs and perform an Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (“EE/CA”) to assess what future response activities might need to be completed at the site. Newmont intends to vigorously defend
any formal claims by the EPA. Newmont has agreed to perform the EE/CA. Newmont cannot reasonably predict the likelihood or outcome of any future action against it arising from this matter.

PT Newmont Minahasa Raya (“PTNMR”) — 80% Newmont Owned

On March 22, 2007, an Indonesian non-governmental organization named Wahana Lingkungan Hidup Indonesia (“WALHI”) filed a civil suit
against PTNMR, the Newmont subsidiary that operated the Minahasa mine in Indonesia, and Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources and Ministry of Environment, alleging pollution from the government-approved and permitted
disposal of mill tailings into Buyat Bay, and seeking a court order requiring PTNMR to fund a 25-year monitoring program in relation to Buyat Bay. In December 2007, the court ruled in PTNMR’s favor and found that WALHI’s allegations of
pollution in Buyat Bay were without merit. In March 2008, WALHI appealed this decision to the Indonesian High Court. On January 27, 2010, the Indonesian High Court upheld the December 2007 ruling in favor of PTNMR. On May 17, 2010, WALHI
filed an appeal of the January 27, 2010 Indonesian High Court ruling seeking review from the Indonesian Supreme Court. Independent sampling and testing of Buyat Bay water and fish, as well as area residents, conducted by the World Health
Organization and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, confirm that PTNMR has not polluted the Buyat Bay environment, and, therefore, has not adversely affected the fish in Buyat Bay or the health of nearby
residents. The Company remains steadfast that it has not caused pollution or health problems.

Other Legal Matters

Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) — 51.35% Newmont Owned

Choropampa

.    In June 2000, a transport contractor of Yanacocha spilled approximately 151 kilograms of elemental mercury
near the town of Choropampa, Peru, which is located 53 miles (85 kilometers) southwest of the Yanacocha mine. Elemental mercury is not used in Yanacocha’s operations but is a by-product of gold mining and was sold to a Lima firm for use in
medical

instruments and industrial applications. A comprehensive health and environmental remediation program was undertaken by Yanacocha in response to the incident. In August 2000, Yanacocha paid under
protest a fine of 1,740,000 Peruvian soles (approximately $0.5) to the Peruvian government. Yanacocha has entered into settlement agreements with a number of individuals impacted by the incident. As compensation for the disruption and inconvenience
caused by the incident, Yanacocha entered into agreements with and provided a variety of public works in the three communities impacted by this incident. Yanacocha cannot predict the likelihood of additional expenditures related to this matter.

Additional lawsuits relating to the Choropampa incident were filed against Yanacocha in the local courts of Cajamarca, Peru, in May
2002 by over 900 Peruvian citizens. A significant number of the plaintiffs in these lawsuits entered into settlement agreements with Yanacocha prior to filing such claims. In April 2008, the Peruvian Supreme Court upheld the validity of these
settlement agreements, which the Company expects to result in the dismissal of all claims brought by previously settled plaintiffs. Yanacocha has also entered into settlement agreements with approximately 350 additional plaintiffs. The claims
asserted by approximately 200 plaintiffs remain. In 2011, Yanacocha was served with 22 complaints alleging grounds to nullify the settlements entered between Yanacocha and the plaintiffs. Yanacocha has answered the complaints and will continue to
vigorously defend its position. Neither the Company nor Yanacocha can reasonably estimate the ultimate loss relating to such claims.

PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”) — 31.5% Newmont Owned

Under the Batu Hijau Contract of Work, beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2010, a portion of PTNNT’s shares were required to be offered
for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or, second, to Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between the following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such
number is positive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by March 31, 2007; 37% by March 31, 2008; 44% by March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. As PT Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an Indonesian national, owned a 20% interest
in PTNNT at all relevant times, in 2006, a 3% interest was required to be offered for sale and, in each of 2007 through 2010, an additional 7% interest was required to be offered (for an aggregate 31% interest). The price at which such interests
were offered for sale to the Indonesian parties was the fair market value of such interest considering PTNNT as a going concern, as agreed with the Indonesian government.

In accordance with the Contract of Work, an offer to sell a 3% interest was made to the Indonesian government in 2006 and an offer for an additional 7% interest was made in each of 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. While
the central government declined to participate in the 2006 and 2007 offers, local governments in the area in which the Batu Hijau mine is located expressed interest in acquiring shares, as did various Indonesian nationals. After disagreement with
the government over whether the government’s first right to purchase had expired and receipt of Notices of Default from the government claiming breach and threatening termination of the Contract of Work, on March 3, 2008, the Indonesian
government filed for international arbitration as provided under the Contract of Work, as did PTNNT.

An international arbitration panel
(the “Panel”) was appointed to resolve these claims and other claims that had arisen in relation to divestment and on March 31, 2009, the Panel issued its final award and decision on the matter. In its decision, the Panel determined
that PTNNT’s foreign shareholders had not complied with the divestiture procedure required by the Contract of Work in 2006 and 2007, but the Panel ruled that the Indonesian government was not entitled to immediately terminate the



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Contract of Work and rejected the Indonesian government’s claim for damages. The Panel granted PTNNT 180 days from the date of notification of the final award to effect transfer of the 2006
3% interest and the 2007 7% interest in PTNNT to the local governments or their respective nominees. The Panel also applied a 180-day cure period to the 2008 7% interest, requiring that PTNNT effect the offer of the 2008 7% interest to the
Indonesian government or its nominee within such 180-day period, and ensure the transfer of such shares if, after agreement on price, the Indonesian government invoked its right of first refusal under the Contract of Work. On July 14, 2009, the
Company reached agreement with the Indonesian government on the price of the 2008 7% interest and the 2009 7% interest and effected the reoffer to the Indonesian government at this newly agreed price. In November and December 2009, sale agreements
were concluded pursuant to which the 2006, 2007 and 2008 shares were transferred to PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”), the nominee of the local governments, and the 2009 shares were transferred to PTMDB in February 2010, resulting in
PTMDB owning a 24% interest in PTNNT.

On December 17, 2010, the Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources, acting on behalf
of the Indonesian government, accepted the offer to acquire the final 7% interest in PTNNT. Subsequently, the Indonesian government designated Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (“PIP”), an agency of the Ministry of Finance, as the entity that
will buy the final stake. On May 6, 2011, PIP and the foreign shareholders entered into a definitive agreement for the sale and purchase of the final 7% divestiture stake. Closing of the transaction is pending receipt of approvals from certain
Indonesian government ministries. Subsequent to signing the agreement, a disagreement arose between the Ministry of Finance and the Indonesian parliament in regard to whether parliamentary approval was needed to allow PIP to make the share purchase.
In October 2011, press reports stated that Indonesia’s Supreme Audit Agency had determined that parliamentary approval is required. The Ministry of Finance continues to dispute the need for parliamentary approval and has taken steps to have the
matter resolved by Indonesia’s Constitutional Court. Further disputes may arise in regard to the divestiture of the 2010 shares.

As part of the negotiation of the sale agreements with PTMDB, the parties executed an operating agreement (the “Operating Agreement”)
under which each recognizes the rights of the Company and Sumitomo to apply their operating standards to the management of PTNNT’s operations, including standards for safety, environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The Operating
Agreement became effective upon the completion of the sale of the 2009 shares in February 2010 and will continue for so long as the Company and Sumitomo own more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the Operating Agreement terminates, then the Company may
lose control over the applicable operating standards for Batu Hijau and will be at risk for operations conducted in a manner that either detracts from value or results in safety, environmental or social standards below those adhered to by the
Company and Sumitomo.

In the event of any future disputes under the Contract of Work or Operating Agreement, there can be no assurance
that the Company would prevail in any such dispute and any termination of such contracts could result in substantial diminution in the value of the Company’s interests in PTNNT.

Effective as of January 1, 2011, the local government in the region where the Batu Hijau mine is located commenced the enforcement of local
regulations that purport to require PTNNT to pay additional taxes based on revenue and the value of PTNNT’s contracts. In addition, the regulations purport to require PTNNT to obtain certain export-related documents from the regional government
for purposes of shipping copper concentrate. PTNNT is required to and has obtained all export related-documents in compliance with the laws and regulations of the central government. PTNNT believes that the new regional regulations are not
enforceable as they expressly contradict higher level



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Indonesian laws that set out the permissible taxes that can be imposed by a regional government and all effective export requirements. PTNNT’s position is supported by Indonesia’s
Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources, Ministry of Trade, and the provincial government. To date, PTNNT has not been forced to comply with these new contradictory regional regulations. On February 4, 2011, PTNNT filed legal
proceedings seeking to have the regulations declared null and void because they conflict with the laws of Indonesia. Subsequently, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a decree declaring these local regulations to be contrary to Indonesian law and
thus unenforceable. Further disputes with the local government could arise in relation to these regulations. PTNNT intends to vigorously defend its position in this dispute.

Additionally, in September 2011, WALHI brought an administrative law claim against Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment to challenge the May 2011 renewal of PTNNT’s submarine tailings permit. PTNNT and the
regional government of KSB (“KSB”) filed separate applications for intervention into the proceedings, both of which were accepted by the Administrative Court. KSB intervened on the side of WALHI, and PTNNT joined on the side of the
Ministry of Environment. PTNNT will defend its submarine tailings permit and is confident that the Ministry of Environment acted properly in renewing PTNNT’s permit.

Newmont Mining Corporation claim relating to PTNNT divestiture

The
Company is aware of a lawsuit apparently filed by Indonesian citizens living in the province of Nusa Tenggara Barat against Indonesia’s Ministry of Finance and other government officials (as defendants) and against PTNNT and the Company (as
co-defendants). Plaintiffs claim that the purchase by the central government of the final 7% divestiture stake in PTNNT violates, or would violate, their human rights. PTNNT’s alleged liability appears to arise from being a party involved in
the process of divestiture, and the Company’s status as a holding company of PTNNT. The allegations regarding liability are vague and unclear. Plaintiffs seek various relief, including an order requiring the defendants and co-defendants to
transfer the final 7% stake to the regional government of Nusa Tenggara Barat and a payment of approximately $247 in damages. The Company considers that there has been no proper service of process, that there is lack of jurisdiction, and that the
claims pertaining to it are entirely without merit.

PT Pukuafu Indah Litigation

In October 2009, PTPI filed a lawsuit in the Central Jakarta District Court against PTNNT and the Indonesian government seeking to cancel the March
2009 arbitration award pertaining to the manner in which divestiture of shares in PTNNT should proceed (refer to the discussion of PTNNT above for the arbitration results). On October 11, 2010, the District Court ruled in favor of PTNNT and the
Indonesian government finding, among other things, that PTPI lacks standing to contest the validity of the arbitration award. PTPI has filed a notice of appeal of the court’s ruling.

Subsequent to its initial claim, PTPI filed numerous additional lawsuits, three of which have been withdrawn, against Newmont Indonesia Limited
(“NIL”) and Nusa Tenggara Mining Corporation (“NTMC”), a subsidiary of Sumitomo, in the South Jakarta District Court. Fundamentally, the cases all relate to PTPI’s contention that it owns, or has rights to own, the shares in
PTNNT that have or will be divested to fulfill the requirements of the PTNNT Contract of Work and the March 2009 arbitration award. PTPI also makes various other allegations, including alleged rights in or to the Company’s or Sumitomo’s
non-divestiture shares in PTNNT, and PTPI asserts claims for significant damages allegedly arising from NIL’s and NTMC’s unlawful acts in transferring the divestiture shares to a third

party. On November 30, 2010, the South Jakarta District Court rendered a decision in favor of PTPI in one of the cases which included an order that NIL/NTMC transfer 31% of PTNNT shares to
PTPI and pay PTPI $26 in damages and certain monetary penalties. The order is not final and binding until the appeal process is completed. NIL and NTMC appealed the decision. On June 28, 2011, the South Jakarta District Court ruled in favor of
NIL and NTMC in one of PTPI’s lawsuits contending that PTPI has rights in or to NIL’s and NTMC’s non-divestiture shares. In the Company’s view, this ruling further conflicts with the November 30, 2010 ruling finding that
PTPI has rights in the divestiture shares. PTPI has filed a notice of appeal.

In January 2010, PTPI also filed a lawsuit against
PTNNT’s President Director, Mr. Martiono Hadianto, alleging wrongful acts associated with the arbitration, including failure to properly share certain information. The South Jakarta District Court issued a decision partially in favor of
PTPI against the PTNNT President Director, requiring the production of arbitration documents. The PTNNT President Director has appealed the decision which is nonbinding until the appeal process is completed.

Newmont, Sumitomo and PTNNT’s management believe that all of PTPI’s claims in these matters are without merit and constitute a material
breach of a written release agreement executed by PTPI in 2009, in which it and its shareholders committed to cease prosecution of all then-pending lawsuits and not to initiate new proceedings, in conjunction with Newmont’s provision of
financing to PTPI in late 2009.

In August 2010, NIL and NVL USA Limited (“NVL”) commenced an arbitration against PTPI in the
Singapore International Arbitration Centre, as provided in relevant financing agreements, seeking declarations that PTPI has violated the release agreement by failing to dismiss its Indonesian lawsuits, that PTPI is in breach of the November 2009
loan facility and related agreements, and that NIL and NVL are entitled to damages arising from PTPI’s and its shareholders’ conduct.

On October 1, 2010, NIL and NVL requested, based upon the release agreement, that the arbitral tribunal issue an interim order requiring PTPI and its shareholders to discontinue the various Indonesian court
proceedings and refrain from bringing additional lawsuits. On October 15, 2010, the tribunal issued an order granting NIL and NVL’s request. The order of the tribunal restrains PTPI and its agents from “proceeding with or continuing
with or assisting or participating in the prosecution of the Indonesian [s]uits” and from commencing additional proceedings relating to the same subject matter as the Indonesian lawsuits. NIL and NVL are in the process of enforcing the interim
award in Indonesian and Singapore courts but it is not known the extent to which the courts will enforce the award or whether PTPI and its shareholders will, in any event, abide by the award and any related court orders. PTPI and its shareholders
have commenced proceedings in Singapore court to contest enforcement of the interim award.

On April 7, 2011, the arbitral tribunal
issued a final award, while keeping the proceedings open to allow NIL and NVL to seek further relief as necessary, finding PTPI and its shareholders in breach of various provisions of the financing agreements, including the release agreement. The
tribunal, for the second time, ordered PTPI and its agents to restrain from proceeding with the Indonesian lawsuits or filing new lawsuits relating to the same subject matter. In addition, the tribunal ordered PTPI and other shareholder defendants,
collectively, to pay more than $11 in damages, costs and expenses. The Company has aggressively sought enforcement of the interim award in Indonesian and Singapore courts and will continue to do so with regard to the April 7, 2011 final award.

The Company intends to continue vigorously defending the PTPI lawsuits and pursuing its claims
against PTPI.

NWG Investments Inc. v. Fronteer Gold Inc.

In April 2011, Newmont acquired Fronteer Gold Inc. (“Fronteer”). Fronteer has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in New York
State Supreme Court by NWG Investments Inc. (“NWG”).

Fronteer acquired NewWest Gold Corporation (“NewWest Gold”) in
September 2007. At the time of that acquisition, NWG owned approximately 86% of NewWest Gold and an individual named Jacob Safra owned or controlled 100% of NWG. Prior to its acquisition of NewWest Gold, Fronteer entered into a June 2007 lock-up
agreement with NWG providing that, among other things, NWG would support Fronteer’s acquisition of NewWest Gold. At that time, Fronteer owned approximately 42% of Aurora Energy Resources Inc. (“Aurora”), which, among other things, had
a uranium exploration project in Labrador, Canada.

NWG contends that, during the negotiations leading up to the lock-up agreement,
Fronteer represented to NWG that Aurora would commence uranium mining in Labrador by 2013, that this was a firm date, that Fronteer was not aware of any obstacle to doing so, that Aurora faced no serious environmental issues in Labrador and that
Aurora’s competitors faced greater delays in commencing uranium mining. NWG further contends that it entered into the lock-up agreement and agreed to support Fronteer’s acquisition of NewWest Gold in reliance upon these purported
representations. On October 11, 2007, less than three weeks after the Fronteer-NewWest Gold transaction closed, a member of the Nunatsiavut Assembly introduced a motion calling for the adoption of a moratorium on uranium mining in Labrador. On
April 8, 2008, the Nunatsiavut Assembly adopted a three-year moratorium on uranium mining in Labrador. NWG contends that Fronteer was aware during the negotiations of the NWG/Fronteer lock-up agreement that the Nunatsiavut Assembly planned on
adopting this moratorium and that its adoption would preclude Aurora from commencing uranium mining by 2013, but Fronteer nonetheless fraudulently induced NWG to enter into the lock-up agreement.

NWG has not yet filed or served a complaint upon Fronteer or Newmont. Newmont intends to defend this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the
outcome.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

Tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with ASC income tax guidance (see Note 10).

The Company has minimum royalty obligations on one of its producing mines in Nevada for the life of the mine. Amounts paid as a minimum royalty
(where production royalties are less than the minimum obligation) in any year are recoverable in future years when the minimum royalty obligation is exceeded. Although the minimum royalty requirement may not be met in a particular year, the Company
expects that over the mine life, gold production will be sufficient to meet the minimum royalty requirements. Minimum royalty payments payable are $28 in 2012 through 2016 and $223 thereafter.

As part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company and its affiliates are required to provide surety bonds, bank letters of credit and bank
guarantees as financial support for various purposes, including environmental reclamation, exploration permitting, workers compensation programs and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010,



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

there were $1,354 and $1,191, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees. The surety bonds, letters of credit and bank guarantees reflect fair value as a
condition of their underlying purpose and are subject to fees competitively determined in the market place. The obligations associated with these instruments are generally related to performance requirements that the Company addresses through its
ongoing operations. As the specific requirements are met, the beneficiary of the associated instrument cancels and/or returns the instrument to the issuing entity. Certain of these instruments are associated with operating sites with long-lived
assets and will remain outstanding until closure. Generally, bonding requirements associated with environmental regulation are becoming more restrictive. However, the Company believes it is in compliance with all applicable bonding obligations and
will be able to satisfy future bonding requirements, through existing or alternative means, as they arise.

Newmont is from time to time
involved in various legal proceedings related to its business. Except in the above-described proceedings, management does not believe that adverse decisions in any pending or threatened proceeding or that amounts that may be required to be paid by
reason thereof will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

During the fiscal period covered by this report, the Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer of the Company, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

There has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report on management’s assessment are included in
