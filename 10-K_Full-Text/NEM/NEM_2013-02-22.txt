NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Introduction

Newmont Mining Corporation is primarily a gold producer
with significant operations and/or assets in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, New Zealand and Mexico. At December 31, 2012, Newmont had attributable proven and probable gold reserves of 99.2 million ounces and an
aggregate land position of approximately 29,000 square miles (75,000 square kilometers). Newmont is also engaged in the production of copper, principally through Batu Hijau in Indonesia and Boddington in Australia. Newmont Mining Corporation’s
original predecessor corporation was incorporated in 1921 under the laws of Delaware.

Newmont’s corporate headquarters are in
Greenwood Village, Colorado, USA. In this report, “Newmont,” the “Company,” “our” and “we” refer to Newmont Mining Corporation together with our affiliates and subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise
requires. References to “A$” refer to Australian currency, “C$” to Canadian currency and “NZ$” to New Zealand currency.

Newmont’s

Sales

and long-lived assets are geographically distributed as follows:

Segment Information, Export Sales, etc.

Our operating segments include North America, South America, Asia Pacific and Africa. Our North America segment consists primarily of Nevada in the
United States and La Herradura in Mexico. Our South America segment consists primarily of Yanacocha and Conga in Peru. Our Asia Pacific segment consists primarily of Boddington in Australia, Batu Hijau in Indonesia and other smaller operations in
Australia and New Zealand. Our Africa segment consists primarily of Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, below and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to our operating segments, domestic and
export sales and lack of dependence on a limited number of customers.

Products

References in this report to “attributable gold ounces” or “attributable copper pounds” mean that portion of gold or copper
produced, sold or included in proven and probable reserves based on our ownership and/or economic interest, unless otherwise noted.

Gold

General.

We had consolidated gold production of 5.6 million ounces (5.0 million attributable ounces) in 2012,
5.9 million ounces (5.2 million attributable ounces) in 2011 and 6.4 million ounces (5.4 million attributable ounces) in 2010. Of our 2012 consolidated gold production, approximately 35% came from North America, 24% from South America, 31%
from Asia Pacific and 10% from Africa.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

For 2012, 2011 and 2010, 92%, 88% and 81%, respectively, of our

Sales

were attributable to
gold. Most of our

Sales

comes from the sale of refined gold. The end product at our gold operations, however, is generally doré bars. Doré is an alloy consisting primarily of gold but also containing silver and other metals.
Doré is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% gold. Under the terms of our refining agreements, the doré bars are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and the
separately-recovered silver is credited to our account or delivered to buyers. Gold sold from Batu Hijau in Indonesia and a portion of the gold from Boddington in Australia, Phoenix in Nevada and Yanacocha in Peru, is sold in a concentrate
containing other metals such as copper and silver.

Gold Uses.

Gold generally is used for fabrication or
investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry.

Gold Supply.

A combination of current mine production, recycling and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by
governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals make up the annual gold supply. Based on public information available for the years 2009 through 2012, on average, current mine production has accounted for
approximately 62% of the annual gold supply.

Gold Price.

The following table presents the annual high, low
and average daily afternoon fixing prices for gold over the past ten years on the London Bullion Market ($/ounce):

Source: Kitco,
Reuters and the London Bullion Market Association

On February 14, 2013, the afternoon fixing gold price on the London Bullion
Market was $1,646 per ounce and the spot market gold price on the New York Commodity Exchange was $1,635 per ounce.

We generally sell
our gold at the prevailing market price during the month in which the gold is delivered to the buyers. We recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable, the gold has been delivered, the title has been transferred and collection of the
sales price is reasonably assured.

Copper

General.

We had consolidated copper production of 224 million pounds (143 million attributable pounds) in 2012, 338 million pounds (197 million pounds) in 2011 and
577 million pounds (314 million pounds) in 2010. Copper production is in the form of concentrate that is sold to smelters for further treatment and refining. For 2012, 2011 and 2010, 8%, 12% and 19%, respectively, of our

Sales

were
attributable to copper.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Copper Uses.

Refined copper is incorporated into wire and cable
products for use in the construction, electric utility, communications and transportation industries. Copper is also used in industrial equipment and machinery, consumer products and a variety of other electrical and electronic applications and is
also used to make brass. Copper substitutes include aluminum, plastics, stainless steel and fiber optics. Refined, or cathode, copper is also an internationally traded commodity.

Copper Supply.

A combination of current mine production and recycled scrap material make up the annual copper supply.

Copper Price.

The copper price is quoted on the London Metal Exchange in terms of dollars per metric ton
of high grade copper. The following table presents the dollar per pound equivalent of the annual high, low and average daily prices of high grade copper on the London Metal Exchange over the past ten years ($/pound):

Source: London
Metal Exchange

On February 14, 2013, the high grade copper closing price on the London Metal Exchange was $3.72 per pound.

We generally sell our copper based on the monthly average market price for the third month following the month in which the delivery to
the smelter takes place. We recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable, the concentrate has been loaded on a vessel, the title has been transferred and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured. For revenue recognition,
we use a provisional price based on the average prevailing market price during the two week period prior to completion of vessel loading. The copper concentrate is marked to market through earnings as an adjustment to revenue until final settlement.

Gold and Copper Processing Methods

Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either milling or heap leaching, depending on the amount of gold contained in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related capital and operating
costs. Higher grade oxide ores are generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into a fine powder and mixed with water into a slurry, which then passes through a carbon-in-leach circuit. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed
using heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or run-of-mine ore on impermeable pads, where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. In both cases, the gold-bearing solution is then
collected and pumped to process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or by zinc precipitation.

Gold contained in ores
that are not naturally-oxidized can be directly milled if the gold is liberated and amenable to cyanidation, generally known as free milling ores. Ores that are not amenable to



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

cyanidation, known as refractory ores, require more costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free milling ore. Higher grade refractory ores are processed through either roasters or
autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores.

Some gold sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant or by bio-milling. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into slurry, then
placed in a tank known as a flotation cell. Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing sulfides to attach to air bubbles and float to the top of the tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into a concentrate
that can then be processed in an autoclave or roaster to recover the gold. Bio-milling incorporates patented technology that involves inoculation of suitable crushed ore on a leach pad with naturally occurring bacteria strains, which oxidize the
sulfides over a period of time. The ore is then processed through an oxide mill.

At Batu Hijau, ore containing copper and gold is
crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported from the mine via conveyor to a concentrator, where it is finely ground and then treated by successive stages of flotation, resulting in a copper/gold concentrate containing approximately 20%
to 23% copper. The concentrate is dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for transport to smelters.

At Boddington and Phoenix, ore
containing copper and gold is crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported via conveyor to a process plant, where it is further crushed and then finely ground as a slurry. The ore is initially treated by successive stages of flotation
resulting in a copper/gold concentrate containing approximately 17% to 20% copper. Flotation concentrates are also processed via a gravity circuit to recover fine liberated gold and then dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for transport to
smelters. The flotation tailings has a residual gold content that is recovered in a carbon-in-leach circuit.

Hedging
Activities

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to gold and copper prices by selling our gold and copper at spot
market prices and consequently, we do not hedge our gold and copper sales. We continue to manage certain risks associated with commodity input costs and foreign currencies using the derivative market.

For additional information, see Hedging in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and Note 17 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Gold, Copper and Silver Reserves

At December 31, 2012, we had 99.2 million attributable ounces of proven and probable gold reserves. We added 5.5 million ounces to
proven and probable reserves, and depleted 6.2 million ounces during 2012. 2012 reserves were calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,400, A$1,400 or NZ$1,800 per ounce. A reconciliation of the changes in attributable proven and probable
gold reserves during the past three years is as follows:



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

A reconciliation of the changes in attributable proven and probable gold reserves for 2012 by
region is as follows:

(1)

Revisions and additions are due to reserve conversions, optimizations, model updates, metal price changes and updated operating costs and recoveries. The impact
of the change in gold price assumption on reserve additions was approximately 1.5 million, 3.3 million and 1.7 million ounces in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The gold price assumption was $1,400 per ounce in 2012, $1,200 per
ounce in 2011 and $950 per ounce in 2010.

(2)

In 2012, we completed a positive feasibility study on Merian and our interest increased from 50% to 80%. We also increased our interest in Regis Resources Ltd.
to 19.75% in 2012 from 16.85% in 2011. In 2010, we recognized our attributable interest in Regis Resources Ltd. for an attributable reserve of 0.3 million ounces.

(3)

In March 2010, our direct ownership interest in Batu Hijau decreased from 35.44% to 31.5% (economic interest decreased from 52.44% to 48.50%) because of the
partial divestiture required under the Contract of Work.

At December 31, 2012, we had 9,510 million
attributable pounds of proven and probable copper reserves. We added 60 million pounds to proven and probable reserves and depleted 270 million pounds during 2012. 2012 reserves were calculated at a copper price of $3.25 or A$3.25 per
pound. A reconciliation of the changes in attributable proven and probable copper reserves during the past three years is as follows:

Our exploration efforts are directed to the discovery of new mineralized material and converting it into proven and
probable reserves. We conduct near-mine exploration around our existing mines and greenfields exploration in other regions globally. Near-mine exploration can result in the discovery of additional deposits, which may receive the economic benefit of
existing operating, processing, and administrative infrastructures. In contrast, the discovery of mineralization through greenfields



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

exploration efforts will require capital investment to build a stand-alone operation. Our

Exploration

expense was $356, $350 and $218 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

For additional information, see Item 2, Properties, Proven and Probable Reserves.

Licenses and Concessions

Other than operating licenses for our mining
and processing facilities, there are no third party patents, licenses or franchises material to our business. In many countries, however, we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to concessions granted by, or under contract with,
the host government. These countries include, among others, Australia, Canada, Ghana, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru and Suriname. The concessions and contracts are subject to the political risks associated with foreign operations. See
Item 1A, Risk Factors, below. For a more detailed description of our Indonesian Contract of Work, see Item 
2, Properties, below.

Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance

Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and
facilities. For more information, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below.

We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against risks that are typical in the operation of our
business, in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be
paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, below.

Environmental Matters

Our United States mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Federal Land Policy and Management Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act; and related state laws. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. Our activities outside the United States are also subject to various levels of governmental
regulations for the protection of the environment and, in some cases, those regulations can be as, or more, restrictive than those in the United States.

We conduct our operations so as to protect public health and the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Each operating mine has a
reclamation plan in place that meets all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2012, $1,341 was accrued for reclamation costs relating to current or recently producing properties.

We are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally,
these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $198 was accrued at December 31, 2012 for such obligations associated with properties
previously owned or operated by us or our subsidiaries. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time.

For a discussion of the most significant reclamation and remediation activities, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Notes 4 and 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, below.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

In addition to legal and regulatory compliance, we have developed complementary programs to guide
our company toward achieving transparent and sustainable environmental and socially responsible performance objectives. Evidencing our management’s commitment towards these objectives, our corporate headquarters are located in an
environmentally sustainable, LEED, gold-certified building. We are committed to managing climate change related risks and responsibly managing our greenhouse gas emissions. We have publicly reported our greenhouse gas emissions since 2004 to the
Carbon Disclosure Project and have been selected to the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index for the past three years. Our greenhouse gas emissions are independently verified to satisfy all the requirements for emissions reporting under ISO
International Standard 14064-3:2006. We actively participate in the International Council on Mining and Metals (“ICMM”) and are committed to the ICMM’s 10 Principles of Sustainable Development and its commitment to implement the
UN Global Compact’s 10 principles on human rights, bribery and corruption, labor and the environment. To ensure sound environmental management systems, 100% of Newmont’s operations have achieved ISO 14001 certification by year-end
2012. We transparently report on our sustainability performance in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines, including the Mining and Metals Sector Supplement. As a result of our efforts, we continue to achieve milestones, such as
being the first gold company listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index World (“DJSI”), remaining a member of the DJSI World Index for six consecutive years, and receiving International Cyanide Management Code certification at 100% of
Newmont operated sites as of the end of 2012.

Health and Safety

We conduct our operations so as to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors and believe our operations are in compliance with
applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. In addition to this, the corporation has established Health & Safety Management and Technical Standards that in most cases well exceed the regulatory requirements in the
jurisdictions in which we operate. The quality of our Health & Safety Management System is audited on an annual basis against the OHSAS 18001 protocol. All of Newmont’s operating sites maintained their OHSAS 18001
certification during 2012. Externally we strive to help improve the overall safety performance of the mining industry and actively participate in the ICMM Health & Safety Committee, the Mining Safety Round Table, NMA’s CORESafety
program and other industry bodies promoting Health & Safety in mining.

Employees and Contractors

Approximately 16,400 people were employed by Newmont at December 31, 2012. In addition, approximately 22,200 people were working as contractors
in support of Newmont’s operations at December 31, 2012.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Our business activities are subject to significant risks, including those described below. Every investor or potential investor in our securities
should carefully consider these risks. If any of the described risks actually occurs, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Such risks are not the only ones we face and additional risks
and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.

A substantial or
extended decline in gold or copper prices would have a material adverse effect on Newmont.

Our business is dependent on the
prices of gold and copper, which fluctuate on a daily basis and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors tending to influence prices include:

•

Gold sales, purchases or leasing by governments and central banks;

•

Speculative short positions taken by significant investors or traders in gold or copper;

•

The relative strength of the U.S. dollar;

•

The monetary policies employed by the world’s major Central Banks;

•

The fiscal policies employed by the world’s major industrialized economies;

•

Expectations of the future rate of inflation;

•

Interest rates;



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

•

Recession or reduced economic activity in the United States, China, India and other industrialized or developing countries;

•

Decreased industrial, jewelry or investment demand;

•

Increased supply from production, disinvestment and scrap;

•

Forward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions; and

•

Availability of cheaper substitute materials.

Any decline in our realized gold or copper price adversely impacts our revenues, net income and operating cash flows, particularly in light of our strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions with respect to
gold or copper sales. We have recorded asset write-downs in the past and may experience additional write-downs as a result of lower gold or copper prices in the future.

In addition, sustained lower gold or copper prices can:

•

Reduce revenues further through production declines due to cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits, that have become uneconomic at sustained
lower gold or copper prices;

•

Reduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore stockpiles and ore on leach pads and increase the likelihood and amount that the Company might
be required to record as an impairment charge related to the carrying value of its stockpiles;

•

Halt or delay the development of new projects;

•

Reduce funds available for exploration and advanced projects with the result that depleted reserves may not be replaced; and

•

Reduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices.

Also see the discussion in Item 1, Business, Gold or Copper Price.

We may be unable to replace gold and copper reserves as they become depleted.

Gold and
copper producers must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore
bodies, by locating new deposits, or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and frequently is unproductive. Our current or future exploration programs may not result in
new mineral producing operations. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may
change.

We may consider, from time to time, the acquisition of ore reserves from others related to development properties and operating
mines. Such acquisitions are typically based on an analysis of a variety of factors including historical operating results, estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of ore reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash and
other operating costs. Other factors that affect our decision to make any such acquisitions may also include our assumptions for future gold or copper prices or other mineral prices and the projected economic returns and evaluations of existing or
potential liabilities associated with the property and its operations and projections of how these may change in the future. In addition, in connection with future acquisitions we may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties and which may
contain information or data that we are unable to independently verify or confirm. Other than historical operating results, all of these factors are uncertain and may have an impact on our revenue, our cash flow and other operating issues, as well
as contributing to the uncertainties related to the process used to estimate ore reserves. In addition, there may be intense competition for the acquisition of attractive mining properties.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

As a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs and any acquisitions which we may
pursue may not result in the expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.

Estimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary
from our estimates.

The reserves stated in this report represent the amount of gold and copper that we estimated, at
December 31, 2012, could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Estimates of proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, to a large extent, based
on the prices of gold and copper and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques. Producers use feasibility studies to derive estimates of capital and operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and
grades of ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, the costs of comparable facilities, the costs of operating and processing equipment and other factors. Actual
operating and capital cost and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from original estimates. Further, it may take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time, the economic
feasibility of production may change.

Additionally, the term “mineralized material” as used in this report does not indicate
proven and probable reserves as defined by the SEC or the Company’s standards. Estimates of mineralized material are subject to further exploration and development, and are, therefore, subject to considerable uncertainty. Despite the
Company’s history of converting a substantial portion of mineralized material to reserves through additional drilling and study work, the Company cannot be certain that any part or parts of the mineralized reserve attributed deposit will ever
be confirmed or converted into SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.

In addition, if the price of gold or copper declines from recent levels, if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, we can offer no
assurance that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that mineral reserves or mineralized material as currently reported can be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain of our ore reserves have become uneconomic,
this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported reserves and mineralized material. Consequently, if our actual mineral reserves and mineralized material are less than current estimates, our business, prospects, results of
operations and financial position may be materially impaired.

Increased operating and capital costs could affect our
profitability.

Costs at any particular mining location are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as variable ore
grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body, as well as the age and utilization rates for the mining and processing related facilities and equipment. In addition, costs are
affected by the price and availability of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete and mining and processing related equipment and facilities. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to
volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. Further, changes in laws and regulations can affect commodity prices, uses and transport. Reported costs may also be affected by changes
in accounting standards. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow.

We could have significant increases in capital and operating costs over the next several years in connection with the development of new projects in challenging jurisdictions and in the sustaining and/or expansion
of existing mining and processing operations. Costs associated with capital expenditures



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

have escalated on an industry-wide basis over the last several years, as a result of factors beyond our control, including the prices of oil, steel and other commodities and labor, as well as the
demand for certain mining and processing equipment. Increased capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the profitability of and cash flow generated from existing operations, as well as the economic returns anticipated from new projects.

Estimates relating to new development projects are uncertain and we may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than
estimated.

Mine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development
phase before production is possible. Such projects could experience unexpected problems and delays during development, construction and mine start-up.

Our decision to develop a project is typically based on the results of feasibility studies, which estimate the anticipated economic returns of a project. The actual project profitability or economic feasibility may
differ from such estimates as a result of any of the following factors, among others:

•

Changes in tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of ore to be mined and processed;

•

Higher input commodity and labor costs;

•

The quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made;

•

Adverse geotechnical conditions;

•

Availability of adequate and skilled labor force and supply and cost of water and power;

•

Fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates;

•

Availability and terms of financing;

•

Delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project
development;

•

Changes in tax laws, the laws and/or regulations around royalties and other taxes due to the regional and national governments and royalty agreements;

•

Weather or severe climate impacts, including without limitation, prolonged or unexpected precipitation and/or sub-zero temperatures; and

•

Potential delays relating to social and community issues, including, without limitation, issues resulting in protests, road blockages or work stoppages.

Our future development activities may not result in the expansion or replacement of current production with new
production, or one or more of these new production sites or facilities may be less profitable than currently anticipated or may not be profitable at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
position.

We may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining.

The exploration for natural resources and the development and production of mining operations are activities that involve a high
level of uncertainty. These can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:

•

Environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals;

•

Industrial accidents, including in connection with the operation of mining transportation equipment and accidents associated with the preparation and ignition of
large-scale blasting operations, milling equipment, conveyor systems and transportation of chemicals, explosions or other materials;



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

•

Surface or underground fires or floods;

•

Unexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form);

•

Ground and water conditions;

•

Fall-of-ground accidents in underground operations;

•

Failure of mining pit slopes and tailings dam walls;

•

Seismic activity; and

•

Other natural phenomena, such as lightning, cyclonic or tropical storms, floods or other inclement weather conditions.

The occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities and development and production of mining operations may
result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated
fluctuations in production, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.

Shortages of critical parts and equipment may adversely affect our operations and development projects.

The mining industry has been impacted, from time to time, by increased demand for critical resources such as input commodities, drilling equipment,
trucks, shovels and tires. These shortages have, at times, impacted the efficiency of our operations, and resulted in cost increases and delays in construction of projects; thereby impacting operating costs, capital expenditures and production and
construction schedules.

Mining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and
countries in which they operate, and are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.

As a result
of public concern about the real or perceived detrimental effects of economic globalization and global climate impacts, businesses generally and large multinational corporations in natural resources industries, such as Newmont, in particular, face
increasing public scrutiny of their activities. These businesses are under pressure to demonstrate that, as they seek to generate satisfactory returns on investment to shareholders, other stakeholders, including employees, governments, communities
surrounding operations and the countries in which they operate, benefit and will continue to benefit from their commercial activities. Such pressures tend to be particularly focused on companies whose activities are perceived to have a high impact
on their social and physical environment. The potential consequences of these pressures include reputational damage, legal suits, increasing social investment obligations and pressure to increase taxes and royalties payable to governments and
communities.

In addition, our ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop and operate mines and to
successfully operate in communities around the world will likely depend on our ability to develop, operate and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or
may not be required by law. Our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining
companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which we operate. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain government permits and approvals may adversely affect our operations, including our ability to explore or
develop properties, commence production or



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

continue operations. Key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be varied in a manner that adversely affects our operations, including our ability to explore or develop
properties, commence production or continue operations.

Our exploration, development, mining and processing operations are subject to
extensive laws and regulations governing worker health and safety and land use and the protection of the environment, which generally apply to air and water quality, protection of endangered, protected or other specified species, hazardous waste
management and reclamation. Some of the countries in which we operate have implemented, and are developing, laws and regulations related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. We have made, and expect to make in the future, significant
expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and burdens, and can cause delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, government permits and approvals which may adversely
impact our closure processes and operations.

Future changes in applicable laws, regulations, permits and approvals or changes in their
enforcement or regulatory interpretation could substantially increase costs to achieve compliance, lead to the revocation of existing or future exploration or mining rights or otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations and
financial position. For instance, the operation of our mines in the United States is subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine
Act”). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. If such inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines, penalties or
sanctions and our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Over the past several years MSHA has significantly increased the numbers
of citations and orders charged against mining operations and increased the dollar penalties assessed for citations issued.

In addition,
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is currently seeking to regulate as hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) process solution streams derived from core beneficiation
operations, such as our roasting operations, in Nevada. Historically, such streams have been considered exempt from RCRA and have been regulated by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. The regulation of these streams as hazardous waste
under RCRA could subject us to civil and criminal penalties for past practices and require us to incur substantial future costs to modify our waste water collection systems and retrofit our tailings storage facilities at our Nevada mining
operations, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Increased global attention or
regulation on consumption of water by industrial activities, as well as water quality discharge, and on restricting or prohibiting the use of cyanide and other hazardous substances in processing activities could similarly have an adverse impact on
our results of operations and financial position due to increased compliance and input costs.

We have implemented a management system
designed to promote continuous improvement in health and safety, environmental performance and community relations. However, our ability to operate, and thus, our results of operations and our financial position, could be adversely affected by
accidents or events detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the health and safety of our employees, the environment or the communities in which we operate.

Mine closure and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made.

Natural resource companies are required to close their operations and rehabilitate the lands that they mine in accordance with a variety of environmental laws and regulations. Estimates of the total ultimate
closure and rehabilitation costs for gold and copper mining operations are significant and based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements and mine closure plans that may



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

change materially. For example, we have conducted extensive remediation work at two inactive sites in the United States. We are conducting remediation activities at a third site in the United
States, an inactive uranium mine and mill site formerly operated by a subsidiary of Newmont.

Any underestimated or unanticipated
rehabilitation costs could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Environmental liabilities are accrued when they become known, are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whenever a previously unrecognized
remediation liability becomes known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased, the amount of that liability and additional cost will be recorded at that time and could materially reduce our consolidated net income attributable to
Newmont stockholders in the related period. In addition, regulators are increasingly requesting security in the form of cash collateral, credit, trust arrangements or guarantees to secure the performance of environmental obligations, which could
have an adverse effect on our financial position. For a more detailed discussion of potential environmental liabilities, see the discussion in Environmental Matters, Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The laws and regulations governing mine closure and remediation in a particular jurisdiction are subject to review at any time and may be amended to
impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental liabilities to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations.

Regulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs which could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

Producing gold is an energy-intensive business, resulting in a significant carbon
footprint. Energy costs account for approximately twenty percent of our overall operating costs, with our principal energy sources being purchased electricity, diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas and coal.

A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the
potential impacts of climate change that are viewed as the result of emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels. At the

th

Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change held in 2012, Parties to the Kyoto Protocol agreed to a second commitment period of emissions reductions from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2020, which takes the form of an amendment to the Protocol. The 37
countries with binding targets in the second commitment period include Australia, and all members of the European Union. Several Annex I Parties who participated in Kyoto’s first-round have not taken on new targets in the second commitment
period, and are Japan, New Zealand, and Russia. Other Annex I Parties without second-round targets are the United States (which never became a member to the Kyoto Protocol) and Canada (which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol effective 2012).

Some of the countries in which we operate have implemented, and are developing, laws and regulations related to climate change and
greenhouse gas emissions. In December 2009, the EPA issued an endangerment finding under the U.S. Clean Air Act that current and projected concentrations of certain mixed greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere threaten the
public health and welfare. Regulations have been adopted and additional laws or regulations may be promulgated in the United States to address the concerns raised by such endangerment finding. To date, U.S. regulations do not impose carbon tax on
our operations but may in the future. Australia passed the Clean Energy Act in 2011 that sets up a mechanism to mitigate climate change by imposing a “carbon tax” on greenhouse gas emissions and encourage investment in clean energy, which
is expected to have an impact to our Australian operations of $30—$40 million annually.

Legislation and increased regulation and
requirements regarding climate change could impose increased costs on us, our venture partners and our suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Until the timing, scope and extent of any future requirements becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition, financial position, results of operations and ability to
compete.

The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would be particular to the
geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures. These impacts may adversely impact the cost, production
and financial performance of our operations.

Our operations are subject to risks of doing business.

Exploration, development, production and mine closure activities are subject to regional, political, economic, community and other risks of doing
business, including:

•

Disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to the rigorous laws and regulations of the U.S. or other jurisdictions,
including without limitation, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Dodd-Frank Act;

•

Changes in laws or regulations;

•

Royalty and tax increases or claims, including retroactive increases and claims and requests to renegotiate terms of existing royalties and taxes, by
governmental entities, including such increases, claims and/or requests by the governments of Ghana, Indonesia, Australia, Peru, the United States and the State of Nevada;

•

Increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a
particular operation is located;

•

Delays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, necessary governmental permits and approvals;

•

Claims for increased mineral royalties or ownership interests by local or indigenous communities;

•

Expropriation or nationalization of property;

•

Currency fluctuations, particularly in countries with high inflation;

•

Foreign exchange controls;

•

Restrictions on the ability of local operating companies to sell gold offshore for U.S. dollars, or on the ability of such companies to hold U.S. dollars or
other foreign currencies in offshore bank accounts;

•

Import and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold;

•

Increases in costs relating to, or restrictions or prohibitions on, the use of ports for concentrate storage and shipping, such as in relation to our Boddington
and Batu Hijau operations where use of alternative ports is not currently economically feasible or in relation to our ability to procure economically feasible ports for developing projects;

•

Restrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore or to otherwise repatriate funds;

•

Risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;

•

Risk of loss due to criminal activities such as trespass, illegal mining, theft and vandalism;

•

Risk of loss due to disease and other potential endemic health issues;

•

Risk of loss due to inability to access our properties or operations;



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

•

Disadvantages relating to submission to the jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitration panels or enforcement or appeals of judgments at foreign courts or
arbitration panels against a sovereign nation within its own territory; and

•

Other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, including risks inherent in contracts with government owned
entities such as unilateral cancellation or renegotiation of contracts, licenses or other mining rights.

Consequently,
our exploration, development and production activities may be affected by these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, some of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.

Our business is subject to U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, a breach or breaches of which could
lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and loss of reputation.

We operate in certain
jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with certain local customs and practices. For example, the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including new anti-bribery legislation in the U.K. that took effect in 2011, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the
purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties. There can be no
assurance that Newmont’s internal control policies and procedures always will protect it from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by the Company’s affiliates, employees or agents. As such,
our corporate policies and processes may not prevent all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and
loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage the Company’s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or cause the market value of our common shares to
decline.

Our Batu Hijau operation in Indonesia is subject to political and economic risks.

We have a substantial investment in Indonesia, a nation that since 1997 has undergone periods of financial crises and currency devaluation,
outbreaks of political and religious violence and acts of terrorism, changes in national leadership, devolution of authority to regional governments, and the secession of East Timor, one of its former provinces. These factors heighten the risk of
abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors, which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts, regulatory changes that impose greater financial burdens, increased taxation and royalties (at both
the national and regional level), denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets. In 2014, elections for the president of Indonesia and the national parliament will be held and the outcome could affect the country’s policies
pertaining to foreign investment.

In regard to issues of resource nationalism, certain government officials and members of parliament
may have a preference for national mining companies to own Indonesia’s mineral assets and the government has advocated policies intended to result in development of additional in-country processing of minerals mined in Indonesia and
restrictions on exportation including the smelting and exportation of copper concentrates. Most recently, in 2012, the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources issued regulations setting out certain levels of processing and refining
required for minerals, and with respect to copper have indicated that only refined copper will be permitted to be exported out of Indonesia as of January 2014. While the 2009 mining law preserves the right of PTNNT to operate Batu Hijau
pursuant to the Contract of Work, which includes a right to export copper concentrates, the Indonesia government has not yet confirmed PTNNT’s exemption from those



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

in-country processing requirements. Due to the limited smelting and refining facilities available in Indonesia, the failure to receive such exemption could result in the inability to export
copper concentrate, which would adversely impact our future operating and financial results.

Violence committed by radical elements in
Indonesia and other countries and the presence of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, as well as U.S. involvement in other conflicts in the Middle East, may increase the risk that foreign operations owned by U.S. companies will be the target of
violence. If our Batu Hijau operation were so targeted it could have an adverse effect on our business.

Our Batu Hijau operation faced
demonstrations by the local community in 2011 relating to a worker recruitment process, including protests and roadblocks. We cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur and the recurrence of significant opposition from
the local community could disrupt mining activities and, thereby, adversely affect Batu Hijau’s assets and operations. Batu Hijau also faced temporary work stoppages in 2011 and 2012, and the operation’s collective bargaining agreement
with the workforce is subject to renewal in late 2014. Indonesia has seen greater worker and union activism in recent times, and a strike or protracted labor agreement negotiation could adversely affect Batu Hijau’s operations.

Over the years, we are required to apply for renewals of certain key permits related to Batu Hijau. PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”),
the entity operating Batu Hijau, employs a submarine tailings placement (“STP”) system. The STP system is operated pursuant to a permit from the government of Indonesia that was renewed in 2011, but is subject to challenge in connection
with certain legal proceedings. See Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of pending litigation. A loss of the STP permit would be expected to adversely impact Batu Hijau operations and may adversely impact
our future operating and financial results.

Our ownership interest in Batu Hijau has been reduced in accordance with the Contract
of Work issued by the Indonesian Government and future reductions in our interest in PTNNT may result in our loss of control over the Batu Hijau operations.

We currently have a 31.5% direct ownership interest in PTNNT, held through Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V. (“NTPBV”), which is owned with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan
(“Sumitomo”). We have a 56.25% interest in NTPBV and a Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTPBV in turn owns 56% of PTNNT, the Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. In December 2009, Newmont entered into a transaction
with P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an unrelated non-controlling shareholder in PTNNT, whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTPI in exchange for (i) a pledge of PTPI’s 20% shareholding in PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of
dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax, (iii) a commitment to support the application of our standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine, and (iv) as of September 16, 2011, powers of attorney to vote and sell
the PTNNT shares (only as further security for the financing arrangement in support of the pledge, and only enforceable in an event of default). On June 25, 2010, to effectuate PTPI’s desire to sell the shares, PTPI completed the sale of
approximately a 2.2% interest in PTNNT to PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama (“PTIMI”), and Newmont entered into a transaction with PTIMI whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTIMI in exchange for (i) a pledge of PTIMI’s
2.2% shareholding in PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax, and (iii) a commitment to support the application of our standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine. Under the terms of the
transaction, the Company has no powers of attorney or other right to vote PTIMI’s shares. Based on the above transactions, Newmont recognizes an additional 17% effective economic interest in PTNNT. Combined with Newmont’s 56.25% ownership
in NTPBV, Newmont has a 48.5% effective economic interest in PTNNT and continues to consolidate Batu Hijau in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Under the Contract of Work executed in 1986 between the Indonesian government and PTNNT (the “Contract of Work”), 51% of PTNNT’s shares were required to be offered for sale, first, to the



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Indonesian government or, second, to Indonesian nationals by March 31, 2010. On May 6, 2011 we announced that a definitive agreement was signed with an agency of the Indonesian
Government’s Ministry of Finance for the sale of the final 7% divestiture stake in PTNNT. Subsequently, a dispute over the legality of the purchase under relevant laws and regulations has arisen between certain members of parliament and the
Ministry of Finance, and the transaction has not yet closed. Upon closing of the transaction, our ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine’s production, assets and proven and probable equity reserves will be reduced to a 27.56% direct
ownership interest as NTPBV’s ownership interest in PTNNT will be reduced to 49%, thus potentially reducing our ability to control the operation at Batu Hijau. In addition, we will have a 17% effective economic interest in PTNNT following the
closing of the transaction through financing arrangements with existing shareholders, and we have identified Variable Interest Entities in connection with our economic interests in PTNNT due to certain funding arrangements and shareholder
commitments. Therefore, we expect to continue to consolidate PTNNT in our Consolidated Financial Statements after the final 7% sale is completed. Loss of control over PTNNT operations may result in our deconsolidation of PTNNT for accounting
purposes, which would reduce our reported consolidated sales, total assets and operating cash flows. See Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the PTNNT share divestiture.

As part of the negotiation of the divestiture share sale agreements with PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”), the nominee of the local
governments, the parties executed an operating agreement (the “Operating Agreement”), under which each recognizes the rights of Newmont and Sumitomo to apply their operating standards to the management of PTNNT’s operations, including
standards for safety, environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The Operating Agreement became effective in February 2010 and will continue for so long as Newmont and Sumitomo collectively own more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the
Operating Agreement terminates, then Newmont may lose control over the applicable operating standards for Batu Hijau and will be at risk for operations conducted in a manner that either detracts from value or results in safety, environmental or
social standards below those adhered to by Newmont and Sumitomo.

The Contract of Work has been and may continue to be the subject
of dispute, legal review, or requests for renegotiation by the Indonesian government, and is subject to termination by the Indonesian government if we do not comply with our obligations, which would result in the loss of all or much of the value of
Batu Hijau.

The divestiture provisions of the Contract of Work have been the subject of dispute. In 2008, the Ministry of Energy
and Mineral Resources of the Indonesian government (the “MEMR”) alleged that PTNNT was in breach of its divestiture requirements under the Contract of Work and threatened to terminate the Contract of Work if PTNNT did not agree to divest
shares in accordance with the direction of the MEMR. The matter was resolved by an international arbitration panel in March 2009. The arbitration decision led to NTPBV divesting 24% of PTNNT’s shares to PTMDB, the party nominated by the MEMR.

Although the Indonesian government has not, since the 2008 arbitration, alleged that PTNNT is in breach of the Contract of Work, future
disputes may arise under the Contract of Work. Moreover, there have been statements, from time to time, by some within the Indonesian government who advocate elimination of Contracts of Work and who may try to instigate future disputes surrounding
the Contract of Work, particularly given that Batu Hijau is one of the largest businesses within the country. Although any dispute under the Contract of Work is subject to international arbitration, there can be no assurance that we would prevail in
any such dispute and any termination of the Contract of Work could result in substantial diminution in the value of our interests in PTNNT. See Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the disputes involving the
Contract of Work.

In January 2009, the Indonesian Government passed a new mining law. While the law preserves the right of PTNNT to
operate our Batu Hijau operations pursuant to the Contract of Work, the Indonesian government is seeking to renegotiate certain provisions of the Contract of Work to conform



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

to certain provisions of the mining law, which could include requests for, among other things, higher royalty rates. In January 2012, the President of Indonesia appointed a committee to evaluate
the process of conforming Contracts of Work to the 2009 mining law.

Our operations at Yanacocha and the development of our Conga
Project in Peru are subject to political and social unrest risks, which have resulted most recently in the rescheduling of construction activities in our Conga project.

During the last several years, Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”), in which we own a 51.35% interest, and whose properties include the mining operations at Yanacocha and the Conga project in Peru, has
been the target of local political and community protests, some of which blocked the road between the Yanacocha mine and Conga project complexes and the City of Cajamarca in Peru and resulted in vandalism and equipment damage. We cannot predict
whether similar or more significant incidents will occur in the future. The recurrence of significant political or community opposition or protests could continue to adversely affect Conga’s development and the continued operation of Yanacocha.

Construction activities on our Conga project were suspended on November 30, 2011 at the request of Peru’s central government
following increasing protests in Cajamarca by anti-mining activists led by the regional president. At the request of the Peruvian central government, the environmental impact assessment prepared in connection with the project, which was
previously approved by the central government in October 2010, was reviewed by independent experts, in an effort to resolve allegations around the environmental viability of Conga. This review concluded that the environmental impact assessment
complied with international standards and provided some recommendations to improve water management. Yanacocha is currently focusing on the construction of water reservoirs prior to the development of other project facilities. However,
development of Conga is contingent upon generating acceptable Project returns and getting local community and government support. Should the Company be unable to continue with the current development plan at Conga, the Company may in the future
reprioritize and reallocate capital to development alternatives in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia, which may result in an impairment of the Conga project.

In the second quarter of 2011, Presidential and Congressional elections resulted in a change in government in Peru. The new administration supported mining as a driver for continued growth and future development of
Peru in 2012. However, we are unable to predict whether the Central government will continue to take similar positions in the future. The regional government actively opposed the Conga project in 2012 and continues to reject the viability of its
development. We are unable to predict the positions that will be taken in the future and whether such positions or changes in law will affect Yanacocha or Conga. Such changes may include increased labor regulations, environmental and other
regulatory requirements, and additional taxes and royalties, as well as future protests, community demands and road blockages. For example, during the third quarter of 2011, the new government enacted four new tax laws. We cannot predict future
positions of either the Central or regional government on foreign investment, mining concessions, land tenure or other regulation. Any change in government positions or laws on these issues could adversely affect the assets and operations of
Yanacocha or Conga, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, any inability to continue to develop the Conga project or operate at Yanacocha could have an adverse impact on our
growth if we are not able to replace its expected production.

Our Company and the mining industry are facing continued
geotechnical challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability.

Newmont and the mining industry are
facing continued geotechnical challenges due to the older age of certain of our mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. This leads to higher pit walls, more complex underground environments and increased exposure to



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

geotechnical instability and hydrological impacts. As our operations are maturing, the open pits at many of our sites are getting deeper and we have experienced certain geotechnical failures at
some of our mines, including, without limitation, in Indonesia at the Batu Hijau open-pit mine and at our operations in Australia, Nevada, Peru, New Zealand and Ghana.

No assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrological conditions, such as landslides and pit wall failures, will not occur in the future or that such events will be detected in
advance. Geotechnical instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and
seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material.

Geotechnical failures could result in limited or restricted access to mine
sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs, loss of ore and other impacts, which could cause one or more of our projects to be less profitable than currently anticipated and could result
in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Currency fluctuations may affect our costs.

Currency fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur at our operations. Gold and copper is sold throughout the world based
principally on the U.S. dollar price, but a portion of our operating expenses are incurred in local currencies. The appreciation of those local currencies against the U.S. dollar increases our costs of production in U.S. dollar terms at mines
located outside the United States.

The foreign currency that primarily impacts our results of operations is the Australian dollar. We
estimate that every $0.10 increase in the U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rate increases annually the U.S. dollar

Costs applicable to sales

by approximately $90 for each ounce of gold sold from operations in Australia before taking
into account the impact of currency hedging. During the majority of 2012, the Australian dollar was relatively unchanged compared to than the U.S. dollar compared to 2011. We hedge up to 90% of our future forecasted Australian dollar denominated
operating expenditures to reduce the variability of our Australian dollar exposure. At December 31, 2012 we have hedged 76%, 61%, 41%, 24% and 7% of our forecasted Australian denominated operating costs in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017,
respectively. Our Australian dollar derivative programs will limit the benefit to Newmont of future decreases, if any, in the U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rates. For additional information, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, below. For a more detailed description of how currency exchange rates may affect costs, see discussion in
Foreign Currency in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions About Market Risk.

Our business requires substantial
capital investment and we may be unable to raise additional funding on favorable terms.

The construction and operation of
potential future projects and various exploration projects will require significant funding. Our operating cash flow and other sources of funding may become insufficient to meet all of these requirements, depending on the timing and costs of
development of these and other projects. As a result, new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant
new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices, our operational performance and our current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices,
unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or a further dislocation in the financial markets as experienced in recent years, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing operations,
retire or service all of our outstanding debt and pay dividends could be significantly constrained.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could increase our
future borrowing costs and adversely affect the availability of new financing.

There can be no assurance that any rating
currently assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Moody’s Investors Service to Newmont will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency’s judgment,
future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects deteriorate, our ratings
could be downgraded by the rating agencies, which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities, our existing debt and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, and increase our borrowing costs, which in
turn could impair our results of operations and financial position.

To the extent that we seek to expand our operations and
increase our reserves through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations.

From time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to provide increased returns to our shareholders and to expand
our operations and reported reserves and, potentially, generate synergies. The success of any acquisition would depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:

•

Identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms;

•

Obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially Newmont’s shareholders;

•

Maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business;

•

Implementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the
acquired business; and

•

To the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in
that new jurisdiction.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully, or
that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial position.

Our operations may be adversely affected by energy shortages.

Our mining operations and development projects require significant amounts of energy. Our principal energy sources are electricity, purchased
petroleum products, natural gas and coal. Some of our operations are in remote locations requiring long distance transmission of power, and in some locations we compete with other companies for access to third party power generators or electrical
supply networks. A disruption in the transmission of energy, inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations.

We have periodically experienced power shortages in Ghana resulting primarily from drought, increasing demands for electricity and insufficient
hydroelectric or other generating capacity which caused curtailment of production at our Ahafo operations. The need to use alternative sources of power may result in higher than anticipated costs, which will affect operating costs. Continued power
shortages and increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Continuation of our mining production is dependent on the availability of sufficient water
supplies to support our mining operations.

Our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore
processing and related support facilities. Our operations in North and South America and Australia are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production at our mines is
dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims and defeat claims adverse to our current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of our operations currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational
demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to our water rights, claims and uses. The loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we
have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could limit our access to
sufficient water resources in our operations, thus adversely affecting our operations.

We are dependent upon information
technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.

We are dependent
upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches,
cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security
breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to the information technology
systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential
or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.

We could also be adversely affected by system or
network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. We are implementing new enterprise software to support various operational functions,
financial reporting and controls management. The implementation of this new system carries risks such as cost overruns, delays and interruptions. If we are not able to successfully implement our new system in a timely manner, we will have to
rely on manual reporting processes and controls over financial reporting that have not been planned, designed or tested. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to the system implementation, but system implementation
failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.

The occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flow and overall profitability.

We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against certain risks related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we
believe are reasonable depending upon the circumstances surrounding each identified risk. However, we may elect not to have insurance for certain risks because of the high premiums associated with insuring those risks or for various other reasons;
in



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

other cases, insurance may not be available for certain risks. Some concern always exists with respect to investments in parts of the world where civil unrest, war, nationalist movements,
political violence or economic crises are possible. These countries may also pose heightened risks of expropriation of assets, business interruption, increased taxation or unilateral modification of concessions and contracts. We do not maintain
insurance policies against political risk. Occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our results of operations and financial position.

Our business depends on good relations with our employees.

Production at our mines is
dependent upon the efforts of our employees and, consequently, our maintenance of good relationships with our employees. Due to union activities or other employee actions, we could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in
production that could adversely affect us. At December 31, 2012, various unions represented approximately 42% of our employee work force worldwide. There can be no assurance that any future disputes will be resolved without disruptions to
operations.

We rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects.

A significant portion of our operations and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As
a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:

•

Negotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;

•

The inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;

•

Reduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;

•

Failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;

•

Interruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;

•

Failure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and

•

Problems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues.

In addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these risks
could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.

We are subject to litigation and may be subject to
additional litigation in the future.

We are currently, or may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other
legal proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to Newmont, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more
detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the event of a dispute arising at
our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability
to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Title to some of our properties may be defective or challenged.

Although we have conducted title reviews of our properties, title review does not preclude third parties from challenging our title or related
property rights. While we believe that we have satisfactory title to our properties, some titles may be defective or subject to challenge. In addition, certain of our Australian properties could be subject to native title or traditional landowner
claims, and our ability to use these properties is dependent on agreements with traditional owners of the properties. For information regarding native title or traditional landowner claims, see the discussion under the Australia/New Zealand section
of Item 2, Properties, below.

Competition from other natural resource companies may harm our business.

We compete with other natural resource companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We also
compete with other natural resource companies for specialized equipment, components and supplies, such as drill rigs, necessary for exploration and development, as well as for rights to mine properties containing gold, copper and other minerals. We
may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, to obtain the services of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or supplies, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties.

Our ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income.

We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being
realized, otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of
future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to
realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2012, the Company’s current and
long-term deferred tax assets were $195 and $481, respectively.

Returns for investments in pension plans are uncertain.

We maintain pension plans for certain employees which provide for specified payments after retirement. The ability of the
pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the plans. Returns, if any, on investments are subject to fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions. A
sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated. During the second half of 2008 and early 2009, market conditions caused the value of the investments in our
pension plans to decrease significantly. As a result, we contributed $48 and $27 to the pension plans in 2012 and 2011, respectively. If future plan investment returns are not sufficient, we may be required to increase the amount of future cash
contributions. For a more detailed discussion of the funding status and expected benefit payments to plan participants, see the discussion in Employee Related Benefits, Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends.

Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the
Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal
year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of
assets. Furthermore, holders of our common stock may be subject to the prior dividend rights of holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to
our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock
and adopted an enhanced gold price-linked dividend policy described under Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities, we are not required to declare cash dividends
on our common stock and our board of directors may reduce, defer or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.

Production and Development Properties

Newmont’s significant production and development properties are described below. Operating statistics for each operation are presented in a
table in the next section of Item 2.

North America

Nevada, USA.

We have been mining gold in Nevada since 1965. Nevada operations include Carlin, located west of the city
of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend, the Phoenix mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles north of Golconda, and the Midas mine near the town of the same name. We
also participate in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”), which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks.

Gold production from Nevada was approximately 1.748 million ounces for 2012 with ore mined from nine open pit and seven underground mines. At December 31, 2012, we reported 35.1 million ounces of
gold reserves in Nevada, with 77% of those ounces in open pit mines and 23% in underground mines. We are advancing several development opportunities in Nevada, including Long Canyon.

The Nevada operations produce gold from a variety of ore types requiring different processing techniques depending on economic and metallurgical
characteristics. To ensure the best use of processing capacity, we use a linear programming model to guide the flow of both mining sequence selection and routing of ore streams to various plants. Refractory ores, which require more complex, higher
cost processing methods, generated 82% of Nevada’s gold production in 2012, compared with 79% in 2011 and 79% in 2010. With respect to remaining reserves, we estimate that approximately



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

85% are refractory ores and 15% are oxide ores. Higher-grade oxide ores are processed by conventional milling and cyanide leaching at Carlin (Mill 5) and Twin Creeks (Juniper). Lower-grade
material with suitable cyanide solubility is treated on heap leach pads at Carlin and Twin Creeks. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through either a roaster at Carlin (Mill 6) or autoclaves at Twin Creeks (Sage). Lower-grade refractory
ores are processed at Carlin by flotation or direct flotation at Mill 5. Mill 5 flotation concentrates are then processed at the Carlin roaster or the Twin Creeks autoclaves and additional gold is recovered from the flotation tails by cyanide
leaching. The Phoenix mill produces a gravity gold concentrate and a copper/gold flotation concentrate and recovers additional gold from cyanide leaching of the flotation tails. Ore from the Midas mine is processed by conventional milling and
Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation. Activated carbon from the various leaching circuits is treated to produce gold doré at the Carlin or Twin Creeks refineries. Zinc precipitate at Midas is refined on-site.

We own, or control through long-term mining leases and unpatented mining claims, all of the minerals and surface area within the boundaries of the
present Nevada mining operations (except for the Turquoise Ridge joint venture described below). The long-term leases extend for at least the anticipated mine life of those deposits. With respect to a significant portion of the Gold Quarry mine at
Carlin, we pay a royalty equivalent to 16.2% of the mineral production. We wholly-own or control the remainder of the Gold Quarry mineral rights, in some cases subject to additional royalties. With respect to certain smaller deposits in Nevada, we
are obligated to pay royalties on production to third parties that vary from 1% to 8% of production.

The Long Canyon exploration project
is located approximately one hundred miles from the Company’s existing infrastructure at Carlin and we believe provides the potential for significant development and operating synergies. During 2012, the project entered into the selection and
confirmation stage as we further develop our understanding of Long Canyon and the district. We have submitted a Plan-of-Operations to the BLM in support of our EIS for operations. We continue to make progress on the exploration program; total of 85
kilometers of drilling was completed in 2012 and we anticipate an additional 65 kilometers to be drilled in 2013. Our intention is to bring the project into production in 2017.

We have a 25% interest in a joint venture with Barrick in the Turquoise Ridge mine. We have an agreement to provide up to 2,000 tons per day of milling capacity at Twin Creeks to the joint venture. Barrick is the
operator of the joint venture. Gold production of 48,000 ounces in 2012 were attributable to Newmont.

In Nevada, mining taxes are
assessed on up to 5% of net proceeds of a mine. Net proceeds are calculated as the excess of gross yield over direct costs. Gross yield is determined as the value received when minerals are sold, exchanged for anything of value or removed from the
state. Direct costs generally include the costs to develop, extract, produce, transport and refine minerals.

Mexico.

We have a 44% interest in the La Herradura joint venture and related gold properties (Herradura,
Soledad-Dipolos and Noche Buena), which are located in the Sonora desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises open pit operations with run-of-mine heap leach processing. Herradura has been
in operation since 1998. Soledad-Dipolos is located 9 kilometers northwest of Herradura and commenced operations in January 2010. Noche Buena is located 23 kilometers northwest of Herradura and operations commenced in Q1 2012. La Herradura is
building an oxide mill to improve recoveries on higher grade material with expected completion in the second half of 2013. La Herradura produced 212,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2012, and at December 31, 2012 we reported 2.6 million
attributable ounces of gold reserves.

South America

The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“MYSRL”) include operations at Yanacocha and the Conga project. We hold a 51.35% interest in
MYSRL with the remaining interests held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”) (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

MYSRL has mining rights with respect to a large land position consisting of concessions granted by
the Peruvian government to MYSRL and a related entity. These mining concessions provide for both the right to explore and exploit. However, MYSRL must first obtain the respective exploration and exploitation permits, which are generally granted in
due course. MYSRL may retain mining concessions indefinitely by paying annual fees and, during exploitation, complying with production obligations or paying assessed fines. Mining concessions are freely assignable or transferable. Beginning
October 1, 2011, mining companies are subject to a revised royalty and special mining tax, dependent on whether or not a stabilization agreement is in effect. The revised royalty and special mining taxes are based on a sliding scale between 5%
to 7%.

Yanacocha, Peru.

Yanacocha is located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30
miles (48 kilometers) north of the city of Cajamarca. Yanacocha began production in 1993 and currently has active open pit mines at Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua, Chaquicocha, Maqui Maqui, Carachugo, and Cerro Negro. Yanacocha has four leach pads,
three processing facilities, and one mill. Yanacocha’s gold production for 2012 was 1.346 million ounces (691,000 attributable ounces) and at December 31, 2012 we reported 3.0 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.

Conga, Peru.

The Conga project is located within close proximity of existing operations at Yanacocha. Due
to local political and community protests, construction and development activities at the Conga project were largely suspended in November 2011. The results of the Peruvian Central Government initiated Environmental Impact Assessment
(“EIA”) independent review were announced on April 20, 2012 and confirmed our initial EIA met Peruvian and International standards. The review made recommendations to provide additional water capacity and social funds, which we have
largely accepted. We announced our decision to move the project forward on a “water first” approach on June 22, 2012. During 2013 the project will be focused on building water reservoirs, completing the last engineering activities,
and accepting delivery of the main equipment purchases. Should we be unable to continue with the current development plan at Conga, we may reprioritize and reallocate capital to development alternatives in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia. If
the project proceeds, average annual estimated attributable gold production of approximately 300,000 to 350,000 ounces and average annual estimated attributable copper production of approximately 80 to 120 million pounds per year are expected
during the first five years of production. At December 31, 2012, we reported 6.5 million attributable ounces of gold reserves and 1,690 million attributable pounds of copper reserves.

La Zanja, Peru.

We hold a 46.94% interest in La Zanja, a gold mine near the city of Cajamarca. The mine commenced
operations in September 2010 and is operated by Buenaventura. The mine consists of two small open pits and one oxide leach pad. La Zanja produced 53,000 attributable gold ounces in 2012 and at December 31, 2012 we reported 0.2 million
attributable ounces of gold reserves.

Merian, Suriname.

We completed a positive feasibility study in the
fourth quarter of 2012 and now own an 80% interest in the Merian project through a joint venture with a subsidiary of Alcoa. We continue to finalize the mineral agreement with the government of Suriname, expected in the first half of 2013. The
development of the Merian project will allow Newmont to pursue a new district with upside potential and the opportunity to grow and extend the operating life of the South American region. First production is targeted for 2015 with initial estimated
gold production (on a 100% basis) of 350,000 to 450,000 ounces per year. At December 31, 2012, we reported 2.9 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.

Asia Pacific

Australia/New Zealand.

In Australia, mineral
exploration and mining titles are granted by the individual states or territories. Mineral titles may also be subject to native title legislation or, in the Northern Territory, to Aboriginal freehold title legislation that entitles indigenous
persons to



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

compensation calculated by reference to the gross value of production. In 1992, the High Court of Australia held that Aboriginal people who have maintained a continuing connection with their land
according to their traditions and customs may hold certain rights in respect of the land (such rights commonly referred to as “native title”). Since the High Court’s decision, Australia has passed legislation providing for the
protection of native title and established procedures for Aboriginal people to claim these rights. The fact that native title is claimed with respect to an area, however, does not necessarily mean that native title exists, and disputes may be
resolved by the courts.

Generally, under native title legislation, all mining titles granted before January 1, 1994 are valid.
Titles granted between January 1, 1994 and December 23, 1996, however, may be subject to invalidation if they were not obtained in compliance with applicable legislative procedures, though subsequent legislation has validated some of these
titles. After December 23, 1996, mining titles over areas where native title is claimed to exist became subject to legislative processes that generally give native title claimants the “right to negotiate” with the title applicant for
compensation and other conditions. Native title holders do not have a veto over the granting of mining titles, but if agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be referred to the National Native Title Tribunal for decision.

Native title claims are not expected to have a material adverse effect on any of our operations in Australia. The High Court of Australia determined
in an August 2002 decision, which refined and narrowed the scope of native title, that native title does not subsist in minerals in Western Australia and that the rights granted under a mining title would, to the extent inconsistent with asserted
native title rights, operate to extinguish those native title rights. Generally, native title is only an issue for Newmont with respect to obtaining new mineral titles or moving from one form of title to another, for example, from an exploration
title to a mining title. In these cases, the requirements for negotiation and the possibility of paying compensation may result in delay and increased costs for mining in the affected areas. Similarly, the process of conducting Aboriginal heritage
surveys to identify and locate areas or sites of Aboriginal cultural significance can result in additional costs and delay in gaining access to land for exploration and mining-related activities.

In Australia, various ad valorem royalties and taxes are paid to state and territorial governments, typically based on a percentage of gross
revenues or earnings. Indigenous communities have negotiated royalty payments as a condition to granting access to areas where they have native title or other property rights. A carbon dioxide tax commenced in Australia on July 1, 2012, whereby
the largest emitters of carbon dioxide are required to pay A$23.00 per metric ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. The carbon price is indexed for inflation through June 30, 2015, when a cap and trade system will be in place.
Carbon costs are primarily driven by electricity and diesel fuel consumption.

Boddington.

Boddington (100%
owned) is located 81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Perth in Western Australia. Boddington has been wholly owned since June 2009 when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”).
Boddington poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial production in November 2009. Boddington produced 724,000 ounces of gold and 67 million pounds of copper in 2012, and at December 31, 2012 we reported
18.6 million ounces of gold reserves and 2,180 million pounds of copper reserves.

Kalgoorlie.

Kalgoorlie (50% owned) comprises the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and
Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth in Western Australia. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick. During
2012, Kalgoorlie produced 341,000 attributable ounces, and at December 31, 2012 we reported 4.2 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.

Jundee.

Jundee (100% owned) is situated approximately 435 miles (700 kilometers) northeast of Perth in Western Australia. We mined ore solely from underground sources in 2012, with
mill feed



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

supplemented from oxide stockpiles for blending purposes. Jundee produced 333,000 ounces of gold in 2012, and at December 31, 2012 we reported 0.5 million ounces of gold reserves.

Tanami.

Tanami (100% owned) includes the Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which
are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs and the Dead Bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of the Granites. Operations are predominantly focused
on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. We have decided to defer further development work on the Tanami Shaft Project, as we focus on (i) improving the execution and
delivery at the existing operation, and (ii) gaining a better understanding of the impact of the nearer surface underground Auron discovery on the overall life-of-mine plan. We expect to reassess the restart date of the Tanami Shaft Project in
2015. During 2012, the Tanami operations produced 183,000 ounces, and at December 31, 2012 we reported 2.2 million ounces of gold reserves.

Waihi, New Zealand.

Waihi (100% owned) is located within the town of Waihi, approximately 94 miles (150 kilometers) southeast of Auckland and currently consists of the Trio underground
deposit and the Martha open pit mine. The Waihi operation produced 67,000 ounces of gold in 2012, and at December 31, 2012 we reported 0.3 million ounces of gold reserves.

Duketon.

We have a 19.75% interest in Regis Resources Ltd. (“Regis”), which owns 100% of the Duketon gold
project, located approximately 200 miles (320 kilometers) northeast of Kalgoorlie. Duketon commenced production on its first mine in the third quarter of 2010 and completed construction of its second mine in 2012 and produced 31,000 attributable
ounces of gold in 2012, and at December 31, 2012 we reported 0.6 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.

Batu Hijau,
Indonesia.

Batu Hijau is located on the island of Sumbawa, approximately 950 miles (1,529 kilometers) east of Jakarta. Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and
construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2012, Batu Hijau produced 157 million pounds of copper (76 million attributable pounds) and 68,000 ounces of gold (33,000 attributable ounces). At December 31,
2012, we reported 3,500 million attributable pounds of copper reserves and 3.5 million attributable ounces of gold reserves.

We own 31.50% of Batu Hijau through Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V. (“NTPBV”), which we own with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of
Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTPBV and the Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTPBV in turn owns 56% of PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”), the Indonesian subsidiary that owns the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine. The
remaining 44% interest in PTNNT is owned by PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”), 24%; P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), 17.8%; and PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama (“PTIMI”), 2.2%.

On May 6, 2011, we announced that a definitive agreement was signed with an agency of the Indonesian Government’s Ministry of Finance for
the sale of the final 7% divestiture stake, as required under the terms of PTNNT’s Contract of Work with the Indonesian Government. NTPBV entered into the agreement with Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (“PIP”). The Government of Indonesia
designated PIP as the buyer for the final 7% interest by exercising a right of first refusal set out in the Contract of Work. Upon closing of the transaction, NTPBV’s interest in Batu Hijau will be reduced to 49%, as required under the Contract
of Work. The price agreed for the 7% stake is approximately $247. Closing of the transaction is pending receipt of approvals from certain Indonesian government ministries. Subsequent to signing the agreement, a disagreement arose between the
Ministry of Finance and the Indonesian parliament in regard to whether parliamentary approval was required to allow PIP to make the share purchase. The Ministry of Finance continues to dispute the need for parliamentary approval and further disputes
may arise in regard to the divestiture of the 7% stake. NTPBV and PIP agreed to extend the period for satisfying the closing conditions of the agreement until April 2013. Our ownership interest in PTNNT following the closing of the transaction will
be 27.56%.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

We have identified Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) (see Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements) in connection with our economic interests in PTNNT due to certain funding arrangements and shareholder commitments. We have financing arrangements with PTPI and PTIMI, unrelated noncontrolling shareholders of PTNNT, whereby we
agreed to advance certain funds to them in exchange for (i) a pledge of their combined 20% share of PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax, (iii) a commitment from them to support the
application of our standards to the operation of Batu Hijau, and (iv) as of September 16, 2011 in respect of PTPI only, powers of attorney to vote and sell PTNNT shares in support of the pledge, enforceable in an event of default as
further security for the funding. As a result, PTPI and PTIMI were determined to be VIEs and our effective economic interest in PTNNT increased by 17% (20% interest net of withholding tax) to 48.50% during 2010. We currently manage Batu Hijau and
our standards are applied at Batu Hijau.

In Indonesia, rights are granted to foreign investors to explore for and to develop mineral
resources within defined areas through Contracts of Work entered into with the Indonesian government. In 1986, PTNNT entered into a Contract of Work with the Indonesian government covering Batu Hijau, under which PTNNT was granted the exclusive
right to explore in the contract area, construct any required facilities, extract and process the mineralized materials, and sell and export the minerals produced, subject to certain requirements including Indonesian government approvals and payment
of royalties to the government. Under the Contract of Work, PTNNT has the right to continue operating the project for 30 years from operational start-up, or longer if approved by the Indonesian government.

Under the Contract of Work our ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine’s proven and probable reserves may be reduced in the future to as low
as 27.56% and ownership interest of NTPBV in PTNNT could be reduced to 49%, thus potentially reducing our ability to control the operation at Batu Hijau or apply our operating standards. As part of the negotiation of the divestiture sale agreements
with PTMDB, the parties executed an operating agreement under which each party recognizes the right of Newmont and Sumitomo to apply their operating standards at Batu Hijau and binds the parties to adhere to our standards for safety, environmental
stewardship and community responsibility. The operating agreement remains in effect for so long as NTPBV owns more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the operating agreement terminates, then we could lose effective control over the operations of Batu
Hijau and will be at risk for operations conducted in a manner that could potentially reduce the value of PTNNT or result in safety, environmental or social standards below those adhered to by us. Such loss of control may cause us to deconsolidate
PTNNT for accounting purposes, which would reduce our reported consolidated sales, cost applicable to sales, amortization, total assets and operating cash flow attributable to PTNNT. See Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Africa

Ahafo, Ghana.

Ahafo (100% owned) is located in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290
kilometers) northwest of Accra. We currently operate four open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 11 pits and an underground mine presently in development. Commercial production in the fourth pit, Amoma, began in October 2010. The process
plant consists of a conventional mill and carbon-in-leach circuit. Ahafo produced 561,000 ounces of gold in 2012, and at December 31, 2012 we reported 11.6 million ounces of gold reserves.

Akyem, Ghana

.    Akyem (100% owned) is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. The
construction activities continue to progress on schedule and on budget. First production is anticipated in late 2013 with approximately three to six months expected for ramp-up from construction completion to commercial production. Gold production
is expected to be approximately 350,000 to 450,000 ounces per year for the first five years of the mine’s operating life of approximately 16 years (based on current gold reserves). At December 31, 2012, we reported 7.4 million ounces
of gold reserves.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

In December 2003, Ghana’s Parliament unanimously ratified an Investment
Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) between Newmont and the government of Ghana. The Investment Agreement establishes a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of any Newmont project in Ghana.
Under the Investment Agreement, we will pay corporate income tax at the Ghana statutory tax rate (presently 35% but not to exceed 32.5%) and fixed gross royalties on gold production of 3.0% (3.6% for any production from forest reserve areas). The
government of Ghana is also entitled to receive 10% of a project’s net cash flow after we have recouped our investment and may acquire up to 20% of a project’s equity at fair market value on or after the 15

th

anniversary of such project’s commencement of production. The Investment Agreement
also contains commitments with respect to job training for local Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local goods and services and environmental protection. In July 2009, the Minister of Finance implemented the National Fiscal
Stabilization Levy, which is an additional tax of profits. Negotiations are ongoing with the commissioner of the Ghana Internal Revenue Service on the applicability of the levy, given Newmont’s Investment Agreement. While negotiations are
pending, we have paid and included $39 in

Income and mining tax expense

to date under the levy.

In 2012, the government of Ghana
enacted a law that increased the corporate income tax from 25% to 35%, eliminated the National Fiscal Stabilization Levy, and changed capital allowances to 20% over 5 years from the previously allowed 80% deduction in year one and then 50% per
year on the remaining balance. Per our Investment Agreement, the increase in the corporate income tax rate would be limited to 32.5% and capital allowances remain at the old rates and basis. The government of Ghana also introduced a bill in
Parliament that sought to impose a “windfall profit tax” of 10% on windfall profits of mining companies. The bill was later withdrawn from Parliament, and it is not clear if or when it will be returned to Parliament and passed into law.
The windfall tax of 10% would not be applicable to our Ghana operations.

In addition, the government of Ghana recently established a
Mining Review Committee (“MRC”) to review fiscal regimes and mining agreements with a view to ensuring that Ghana benefits adequately and fairly from gains in the mining sector. Newmont is currently in discussions with the MRC on certain
aspects of the Investment Agreement which they would like to be reviewed. The discussions are in the early stages and we cannot determine the potential impact at this stage. See Risk Factor “Our operations are subject to risks of doing
business” for a description of risks inherent in contracts with governments.

Proven and Probable Reserves

We had attributable proven and probable gold reserves of 99.2 million ounces at December 31, 2012, calculated at a gold price assumption
of $1,400, A$1,400 or NZ$1,800 per ounce. Our 2012 reserves would decline by approximately 8% (7.6 million ounces), if calculated at a $1,300 per ounce gold price, all other assumptions remaining constant. An increase in the gold price to $1,500 per
ounce would increase reserves by approximately 3% (2.8 million ounces), all other assumptions remaining constant. For 2011, reserves were calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,200, A$1,250 or NZ$1,600 per ounce.

At December 31, 2012, our proven and probable gold reserves in North America were 37.7 million ounces. Outside of North America, year-end
attributable proven and probable gold reserves were 61.5 million ounces, including 29.9 million ounces in Asia Pacific, 19.0 million ounces in Africa and 12.6 million ounces in South America.

Our attributable proven and probable copper reserves at December 31, 2012 were 9,510 million pounds. For 2012, reserves were calculated
at a copper price assumption of $3.25 or A$3.25 per pound, consistent with the copper price assumption used in 2011.

Our attributable
proven and probable silver reserves at December 31, 2012 were 185.8 million ounces. For 2012, reserves were calculated at a silver price assumption of $30.00 or A$30.00 per ounce, increased from $22.00 or A$23.00 per ounce used in 2011.
Silver reserves are generally a by-product of gold and/or copper reserves, with significant enough levels to be estimated and included in calculations for mine planning and operations.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Under our current mining plans, all of our reserves are located on fee property or mining claims
or will be depleted during the terms of existing mining licenses or concessions, or where applicable, any assured renewal or extension periods for such licenses or concessions.

Proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we determined economic
feasibility. Metal price assumptions follow U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidance not to exceed a three year trailing average. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery,
operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables below list the average metallurgical recovery rate for
each deposit, which takes into account the relevant processing methods. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process, varies with material type, price, metallurgical recoveries, operating costs and
co—or by-product credits.

The proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at
the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold and copper will be realized. Ounces of gold or pounds of copper included in the proven and probable reserves are calculated without regard to any losses
during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold and copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render
certain proven and probable reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.

We publish reserves annually, and will recalculate reserves at December 31, 2013, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, in future production and capital costs, divestments and depletion as well as
any acquisitions and additions during 2013.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

The following tables detail gold proven and probable reserves reflecting only those reserves
attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest at December 31, 2012 and 2011:



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

(1)

The term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve
determination.

The term “economically,” as used in the definition of reserve, means that profitable
extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in a full feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

The term “legally,” as used in the definition of reserve, does not imply that all
permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that
issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Newmont’s current mine plans.

The term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings
or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (c) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size,
shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.

The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which
quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves,
is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.

Proven and probable reserves include gold, copper or silver
attributable to Newmont’s ownership or economic interest.

Proven and probable reserves were calculated using different cut-off
grades. The term “cut-off grade” means the lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process. Cut-off grades vary between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products,
amenability of the ore to gold, copper or silver extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available.

2012 reserves were
calculated at a gold price of $1,400, A$1,400 or NZ$1,800 per ounce unless otherwise noted.

2011 reserves were calculated at a gold
price of $1,200, A$1,250 or NZ$1,600 per ounce unless otherwise noted.

Mineralized Material

We had attributable gold Mineralized Material of 1,114 million tons at an average grade of 0.020 ounces per ton at December 31, 2012, calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,600, A$1,600 or NZ$2,050
per ounce.

At December 31, 2012, our gold Mineralized Material included 429 million tons in North America, 131 million
tons in South America, 458 million tons in Asia Pacific and 96 million tons in Africa.

At December 31, 2012, our
attributable copper Mineralized Material of 721 million tons at a grade of 0.15% copper was calculated at a copper price assumption of $3.50 or A$3.50 per pound.

At December 31, 2012, our attributable silver Mineralized Material of 468 million tons at a grade of 0.113 ounces per ton was calculated at a silver price assumption of $35.00 or A$35.00 per ounce. Silver
Mineralized Material is generally a by-product of gold and/or copper Mineralized Material estimates, with significant enough levels to be estimated and included in future calculations of potential economic extraction.

All of our Mineralized Material is located on fee property or mining claims. Mineralized material is a mineralized underground body which has been
intersected by a sufficient number of closely spaced drill holes and or underground sampling to support sufficient tonnage and average grade of metal(s) to warrant further exploration-development work. The deposit does not qualify as a commercially
minable orebody until it could be legally and economically extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Metal price assumptions are based on up to a twenty percent premium over reserve prices.

The Mineralized Material figures presented herein do not include that part of our Mineralized Material that have been converted to Proven and
Probable Reserves as shown above (they are reported exclusive of reserves), and have been estimated based on information available at the time of calculation. Market fluctuations in the price of gold, copper and silver, as well as increased
production



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain Mineralized Material containing relatively lower grades of mineralization as potentially uneconomic to exploit and might result
in a reduction of Mineralized Material.

We will publish Mineralized Materials annually, and will recalculate them at December 31,
2013, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, in future production and capital costs, divestments and conversion to reserves, as well as any acquisitions and additions during 2013.

ITEM 4.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES

At Newmont, safety is a core value and we strive for superior performance. Our health and safety management system, which includes detailed
standards and procedures for safe production, addresses topics such as employee training, risk management, workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation and program auditing. In addition to strong leadership and involvement from
all levels of the organization, these programs and procedures form the cornerstone of safety at Newmont, ensuring that employees are provided a safe and healthy environment and are intended to reduce workplace accidents, incidents and losses, comply
with all mining-related regulations and provide support for both regulators and the industry to improve mine safety.

In addition, we
have established our “Rapid Response” process to mitigate and prevent the escalation of adverse consequences if existing risk management controls fail, particularly if an incident may have the potential to seriously impact the safety of
employees, the community or the environment. This process provides appropriate support to an affected site to complement their technical response to an incident, so as to reduce the impact by considering the environmental, strategic, legal,
financial and public image aspects of the incident, to ensure communications are being carried out in accordance with legal and ethical requirements and to identify actions in addition to those addressing the immediate hazards.

The operation of our U.S. based mines is subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the
Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Following passage of The Mine
Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, MSHA significantly increased the numbers of citations and orders charged against mining operations. The dollar penalties assessed for citations issued has also increased in recent years.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Newmont is required to report certain mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required
by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, and that required information is included in Exhibit 95 and is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASE OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is listed and principally traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “NEM”.

Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited’s exchangeable shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol “NMC”.
On December 15, 2011, as a result of a plan of arrangement, holders of exchangeable shares received, at their election, for each existing exchangeable share, one new exchangeable share of Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited or one
share of Newmont common stock. In connection with the plan of arrangement, 1.6 million shares were converted from exchangeable shares to Newmont common stock. For a description of the arrangement, please see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on
December 19, 2011.

On February 14, 2013, there were 4,898,042 exchangeable shares outstanding, which were held by 9 holders of
record. The exchangeable shares are exchangeable at the option of the holders into Newmont common stock. Holders of Exchangeable Shares are therefore entitled to receive dividends equivalent to those that Newmont declares on its common stock.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the closing high and low sales prices per share of Newmont’s common

Advancing our project pipeline.

We manage our wider project portfolio to maintain flexibility to address the development risks associated with our projects including permitting, local community and government support, engineering and procurement
availability, technical issues, escalating costs and other associated risks that could adversely impact the timing and costs of certain opportunities.

Our opportunities in the Execution phase of development comprise a significant part of the Company’s growth strategy and include Akyem in Ghana, Phoenix Copper Leach in Nevada and Conga in Peru, as described
further below.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Emigrant, Nevada.

Construction is complete and commercial production
was achieved on August 30, 2012. Gold production is expected to be 80,000 to 90,000 ounces per year at

Costs applicable to sales

of $500 to $600 per ounce for the first five years. Total capital costs were $102.

Akyem, Ghana

.     Construction activities continue to progress on schedule and on budget. First production is expected in
late 2013 with a three to six month ramp-up expected to commercial production. Gold production is expected to be 350,000 to 450,000 ounces per year at

Costs applicable to sales

of $500 to $650 per ounce for the first five years of the
mine’s operating life of approximately 16 years (based on current gold reserves). Capital costs are estimated at $850 to $1,100, of which $688 have been incurred at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2012, we reported 7.4 million
ounces of gold reserves at Akyem.

Phoenix Copper Leach, Nevada

.    The Board of Directors authorized full
funding for the Phoenix Copper Leach project in April 2012. Copper production is expected to be approximately 20 million pounds per year for the first five years of production at

Costs applicable to sales

of $1.75 to $2.00 per pound.
First production is expected in the second half of 2013. Capital costs are expected to be $170 to $215, of which $79 have been incurred at December 31, 2012.

Conga, Peru

.    Due to local political and community protests, construction and development activities at the Conga project were largely suspended in November 2011. The results of the
Peruvian Central Government initiated Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) independent review were announced on April 20, 2012 and confirmed our initial EIA met Peruvian and International standards. The review made recommendations
to provide additional water capacity and social funds, which we have largely accepted. We announced our decision to move the project forward on a “water first” approach on June 22, 2012. Spending on the project will be reduced in 2013
to approximately $250 to $300, focusing on building water reservoirs, completing the last engineering activities, and accepting delivery of the main equipment purchases. Total property, plant and mine development was $1,480 at December 31,
2012. At December 31, 2012 we reported 6.5 million attributable ounces of gold reserves and 1,690 million attributable pounds of copper reserves at Conga. Construction of Conga and the implementation of the independent EIA review
recommendations will continue provided it can be done in a safe manner with risk-adjusted returns that justify future investment. Should we be unable to continue with the current development plan at Conga, we may reprioritize and reallocate capital
to development alternatives in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia which may result in a potential accounting impairment. See Item1A, Risk Factors, above for a description of political risks related to the project’s development.

Tanami Shaft, Australia.

We have decided to defer further development work on the Tanami Shaft Project, as we focus
on (i) improving the execution and delivery at the existing operation, and (ii) we better understand the impact of the nearer surface underground Auron discovery on the overall life-of-mine plan. We expect to reassess the restart date of
the Tanami Shaft Project in 2015.

We continue to advance earlier stage development assets through our project pipeline in our four
operating regions. The exploration, construction and operation of these earlier stage development assets may require significant funding if they go into execution. Two of these projects are described further below:

Merian, Suriname

.    Positive feasibility study work for the Merian project began in the third quarter of 2011 and was
completed in 2012, increasing our equity interest in the joint venture with Alcoa to 80%. We continue to finalize the mineral agreement with the government of Suriname, expected in the first half of 2013. The development of the Merian project will
allow Newmont to pursue a new district with upside potential and the opportunity to grow and extend the operating life of the South American region. First production is targeted for 2015 with initial estimated gold production (on a 100% basis)
of 350,000 to 450,000 ounces per year. At December 31, 2012, we reported 2.9 million attributable ounces of gold reserves at Merian.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Long Canyon, Nevada

.    During 2012, the project entered the selection
and confirmation stage as we further develop our understanding of Long Canyon and the district. We have submitted the Plan-of-Operations to the Bureau of Land Management in support of our Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”). We continue
to make progress on the exploration program. A total of 85 kilometers of drilling was completed in 2012 and we anticipate an additional 65 kilometers to be drilled in 2013. Our intention is to bring the project into production in 2017.

NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Consolidated Financial Performance

Sales decreased 5% in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower consolidated gold ounces and copper pounds sold, partially offset by a higher average
realized gold price. The average realized gold price increased 6% to $1,662 per ounce in 2012 from $1,562 per ounce in 2011. The average realized copper price, including $22 unfavorable mark to market adjustments on provisionally priced copper
sales, decreased (3)% to $3.43 per pound in 2012 compared to $3.54 per pound in 2011. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower production in Asia Pacific, primarily Batu Hijau, partially offset by higher production at
Yanacocha. Copper pounds sold decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower production at Batu Hijau, partially offset by higher production at Boddington.

Costs applicable to sales

increased 9% in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher waste
mining activities, higher milling and royalty costs, higher diesel prices and a stronger Australian dollar.

Liquidity

Our financial position was as follows:

During 2012, our debt and liquidity positions were affected by the following:

•

Net cash provided from continuing operations of $2,388;

•

Capital expenditures of $3,210;

•

Income and mining taxes paid of $1,261;

•

Proceeds from debt of $1,376,net of repayments and payment conversion premium on debt; and

•

Dividends paid to common shareholders of $695.

Looking Forward

We will continue to focus on operational and project excellence in 2013
to deliver on our plans and advance our project pipeline, resulting in the following expectations for 2013:

•

Attributable gold production of approximately 4.8 to 5.1 million ounces at

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated ounce sold of approximately
$675 to $750;

•

Attributable copper production of approximately 150 to 170 million pounds at

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated copper pound sold of
approximately $2.25 to $2.50;

•

Consolidated capital expenditures of approximately $2,400 to $2,600, with approximately 40% allocated to development capital, including at the Akyem project,
Ahafo Mill Expansion, the Conga project and other expansion projects in Nevada and at La Herradura, with the remaining 60% expected to be spent on sustaining capital;

•

All-in sustaining costs of approximately $1,100 to $1,200 per gold ounce of production. All-in sustaining cost is a non-GAAP metric defined by the Company as the
sum of costs applicable



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

to sales, copper sales credits, G&A, exploration expense, advanced projects and R&D, other expense, and sustaining capital. All-in sustaining cost per ounce is calculated by dividing
all-in sustaining cost by the estimated consolidated ounces sold;

•

Our investment priorities include completing construction of Akyem in 2013, finishing the Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau during 2013 and 2014, and
identifying the best path forward for Conga in Peru. We expect capital expenditures to decrease from 2012 to 2013 by approximately 20%, as declining capital commitments for Conga, Akyem and Tanami are partially offset by increasing development
capital for the Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana as well as the Phoenix Copper Leach and the proposed Turf/Leeville Vent Shaft development in Nevada. Additional capital investment is also possible at the Merian project in Suriname in 2013 pending the
outcome of further dialogue with the government and additional project evaluation.

Certain key factors will affect
our future financial and operating results. These include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

Our 2013 expectations, particularly with respect to production volumes,

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce or pound and All-in sustaining costs per ounce
may differ significantly from actual quarter and full year results due to variations in mine planning and sequencing, ore grades and hardness, metal recoveries, waste removal, commodity input prices and foreign currency exchange rates; and

•

Future investments in Akyem, Ahafo North, and the Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana, Conga in Peru, Long Canyon in Nevada, and Merian in Suriname will require
significant funding. Our operating cash flow may become insufficient to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital
will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices and our operational performance, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding
limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends could be significantly constrained.

Accounting Developments

For a discussion of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Policies

Listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset,
liability, revenue or expense being reported.

Amortization

Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and
amortized using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment and their components. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable
reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine.

Costs incurred to develop
new properties are capitalized as incurred where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

reserves. At our surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At our underground mines, these costs include
the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using the units-of-production (“UOP”) method over the estimated life of
the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves.

Major development costs incurred
after the commencement of production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. To the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the
estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated
recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area.

The calculation of the UOP rate of
amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This
would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These changes could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration
activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price
assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. If reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. Such changes
in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves.

The expected useful lives used in amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above.
Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for the purpose of amortization calculations.

Carrying Value of Stockpiles

Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Mine sequencing may result in mining material at a faster rate than can be processed. We generally process the
highest ore grade material first to maximize metal production; however, a blend of stockpiled material may be processed to balance hardness and/or metallurgy in order to maximize throughput and recovery. Processing of lower grade stockpiled ore may
continue after mining operations are completed. Sulfide ore stockpiles are subject to oxidation over time which can reduce expected future recoveries. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the
number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are added to stockpiles based on
current mining costs, including applicable overhead and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed at each stockpile’s average cost per recoverable ounce of gold or pound of copper as material is processed.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

The following is a summary of our ore stockpiles:

We record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value (“NRV”), and carrying values
are evaluated at least quarterly. NRV represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need
to record write-downs of stockpiles include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. The significant assumptions
in determining the stockpile NRV for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2012 included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce, a long-term copper
price of $3.50 per pound and a U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $1.00 per A$1.00. If short-term and long-term metals prices decrease, the value of the stockpiles decrease, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of stockpiles to
NRV.

The NRV measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future
operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and
no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

The following is a summary of the historical stockpile cost and estimated future processing costs
by region:

Carrying Value of Ore on Leach Pads

Ore on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed on leach pads where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to
dissolve the gold. Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per
estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad.

Estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities
of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of the
recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete.

Although the
quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the
ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, our operating results have not been materially
impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of gold on our leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to NRV
are accounted for on a prospective basis. The significant assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2012 apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation
included



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce. If short-term and long-term gold prices decrease, the value of the ore on leach pads decrease, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on
leach pads to NRV.

The following is a summary of our ore on leach pads:

The following is a summary of our ore on leach pad historical cost and estimated future processing costs by region:

Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets

We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may
not be recoverable. Asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded
based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, trends and related factors),
production levels, operating costs, capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine plans. The significant assumptions in determining the future cash flows for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2012 apart from
production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $3.50 per pound and U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $1.00 per A$1.00.
During 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recorded impairments of $52, $2,084, and $6, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of property, plant and mine development as part of

Write-down of property, plant and mine development.

Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable
reserves are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The term “recoverable minerals” refers to the estimated amount of gold or
other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management’s relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are
grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups.

As discussed above under Amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally, production, capital and reclamation
costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to
those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as
exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling.

Derivative Instruments

With the exception of the Call Spread Transactions (as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), all financial instruments
that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the statements of consolidated income, except for the effective portion of the change in fair value of
derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges. Management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates
and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair value of derivatives. Certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the
effective portion of changes in fair value of these instruments are deferred in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

and will be recognized in the statements of consolidated income when the underlying transaction designated as the hedged
item impacts earnings. The derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges are designated against foreign currency expenditures, diesel purchases, or future debt interest payments where management believes the forecasted transaction is
probable of occurring. To the extent that management determines that the forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses deferred in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

would be reclassified to the statements
of consolidated income immediately.

Reclamation and Remediation Obligations

Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated
present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and remediation costs. Reclamation obligations are based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance
will occur. We review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine.

Reclamation obligations for inactive mines
are accrued based on management’s best estimate of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected
in earnings in the period an estimate is revised.

Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make
estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts
estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and
remediation.

Income and Mining Taxes

We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires
management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer above to Carrying
Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax
assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets recorded
at the reporting date.

Our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in
multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize
potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of
changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax
liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If an estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. We recognize interest and
penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in

Costs applicable to sales

for gold increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher mining, milling, and
royalty costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes and an increase to stockpiles. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to higher mining and milling costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes, higher silver by-product credits and a
build-up of inventories and stockpiles.

Costs applicable to sales

for copper increased in 2012 from 2011 due to continued waste mining at Batu Hijau and higher milling costs at Boddington, coupled with the higher allocation of costs to

Exploration

expense increased to $356 in 2012 from $350 in 2011 due to additional near mine expenditures in
South America, Asia Pacific and Africa, mostly offset by the elimination of exploration at Hope Bay.

Exploration

expense increased in 2011 from $218 in 2010 due to additional near mine expenditures in all regions, with the largest increases
at Nevada, Yanacocha, Ahafo, Jundee and Tanami and increased regional expenditures at Long Canyon and Hope Bay. We expect

Exploration

expense to decrease to approximately $250 to $300 in 2013, focused primarily on Carlin underground and Long
Canyon in Nevada, La Herradura in Mexico and Jundee in Australia.

During 2012, we added 5.5 million ounces to proven and probable
reserves, with 6.2 million ounces of depletion. Reserve additions were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at the Merian project in Suriname (1.8 million ounces), Carlin underground, (1.7 million ounces) and La Herradura (0.6
million ounces) with the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in all regions (1.4 million ounces). The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of 1.5 million
ounces.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

During 2011, we added 11.6 million ounces to proven and probable reserves, with
6.3 million ounces of depletion. Reserve additions were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Ahafo (2.7 million ounces), Carlin open pit, (2.3 million ounces), Phoenix (1.5 million ounces), Carlin underground (1.2 million
ounces), Kalgoorlie (1.0 million ounces) and Tanami (0.7 million ounces) with the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in in all regions (2.2 million ounces). The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on
these reserve additions was an increase of 3.3 million ounces.

During 2010, we added 8.2 million ounces to proven and probable
reserves, with 6.5 million ounces of depletion. Reserve additions were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Leeville (1.8 million ounces), Ahafo (1.5 million ounces), Twin Creeks (1.4 million ounces), Phoenix (0.8 million
ounces), La Herradura (0.7 million ounces) and Tanami (0.7 million ounces) with most of the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in the United States, Australia and South America (1.8 million ounces). Gold reserves were
revised down by 0.5 million ounces at Akyem in Ghana, primarily due to new mining assumptions and higher cutoff grades. The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of 1.7 million
ounces.

Advanced projects, research and development

expense includes development project management costs, feasibility studies
and certain drilling costs.

Advanced projects, research and development

expense decreased 7% in 2012 compared to 2011 due to placing Hope Bay on care and maintenance, partially offset by a focus on Merian in Suriname, Long Canyon in Nevada,
Chaquicocha underground at Yanacocha, Elang in Indonesia and Ahafo mill expansion in Africa. We expect

Advanced projects, research and development

expense to be approximately $350 to $400 in 2013, focused primarily on Long Canyon in Nevada,
Elang in Indonesia, and Subika expansion in Africa.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

General and administrative

expense increased to $212 in 2012, compared to $198 in 2011, due
to higher benefit and compensation costs.

General and administrative

expense increased in 2011 compared to $178 in 2010 due to higher benefit and compensation costs and higher consulting fees.

General and administrative

expense as a
percentage of

Sales

was 2.1% in 2012, compared to 1.9% and 1.9% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. We expect

General and administrative

expense to be approximately $200 to $250 in 2013.

Write-down of property, plant and mine development

totaled $52, $2,084 and $6 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 2012 write-down is
primarily due to an impairment of the FALC JV diamond project as well as miscellaneous asset impairments at Conga, Australia and Batu Hijau. The write-down in 2011 was primarily related to the Hope Bay project. We placed the Hope Bay project on care
and maintenance after evaluating existing development options in our project pipeline. On January 28, 2013 we signed a definitive acquisition agreement with TMAC Resources, Inc. for the sale of 100% of the Hope Bay project. The transaction is
subject to certain conditions and the receipt of all required regulatory and third party approvals. The 2010 write-down was primarily related to asset impairments in Nevada.

Other expense, net

was $449, $265 and $261 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in 2012 over 2011 is due to Hope Bay care and maintenance costs, restructuring charges and higher expenses for
regional administration and community development, partially offset by the Indonesian value added tax settlement and Fronteer acquisition costs in 2011. The increase in 2011 over 2010 is due to Fronteer acquisition costs, an impairment of inventory
at Hope Bay and higher regional administration costs, partially offset by lower community development costs.

Other income, net

was $278, $12 and $109 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in 2012 over 2011 is due to lower other-than-temporary impairment charges for marketable equity securities, the sale of non-core assets, a reduction of an allowance for loan
receivable, higher income from development projects, a gain on derivative ineffectiveness and higher Canadian Oil Sands dividends, partially offset by a lower gain on sale of investments. The decrease in 2011 over 2010 is due to other-than-temporary
impairment charges for marketable securities primarily acquired with the Fronteer acquisition in 2011, lower Canadian Oil Sands dividends as well as the sale of non-core assets in 2010, partially offset by the gain on the sale of investments, higher
income from developing projects and lower foreign exchange losses.

Interest expense, net

was $249, $244 and $279 for 2012, 2011
and 2010, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $107, $52 and $21 in each year, respectively.

Interest expense, net

increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the issuance of the 2022 and 2042 Senior Notes, partially offset by the
repayment of the 2012 Convertible Senior Notes and the increase in capitalized interest due to higher development project expenditures.

Interest expense, net

decreased in 2011 from 2010 due to the increase in capitalized interest for the
advancement of our Conga and Akyem projects. We expect

Interest expense, net

to be approximately $200 to $250 in 2013.

Income
and mining tax expense

was $869, $713 and $856 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective tax rates were 28%, 39% and 21% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The lower tax rate in 2012 when compared to 2011 is primarily due to the
2011 impairment related to the Hope Bay project and the impact it had on the realizability of our Canadian deferred tax assets. Without the write-down on the Hope Bay project, the 2011 annual effective tax rate would have been 30%. The higher tax
rate in 2011 when compared to 2010 is due to the aforementioned impairment and the significant tax benefit recognized in 2010 as a result of “check the box” elections made with respect to certain of our non-US subsidiaries. As a
result of the elections, the subsidiaries are treated as flow-through entities for US federal income tax purposes. The restructuring resulted in the recording of a deferred tax asset, calculated as the difference between fair market valuations
of the subsidiaries compared to the underlying financial statement basis in the assets.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

The factors that most significantly impacted our effective tax rates for the three periods are
percentage depletion, changes in estimates of reserves for income tax uncertainties, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, mining taxes and the impact of certain specific transactions. Many of these factors are sensitive to the
average realized price of gold and other metals. For a complete discussion, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During
2011, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued a Technical Advice Memorandum (“TAM”) to the Company regarding the U.S. income tax treatment of the Price Capped Forward Sales Contracts settled in cash in 2007. The TAM provides guidance
which is unfavorable to the Company. The Company is vigorously defending its positions through all processes available to it and believes it should prevail.

Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing our effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, the effective tax
rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. The effective tax rate is expected to be between 30% and 32% in 2013.

Net income
attributable to noncontrolling interests

was as follows:

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

decreased in 2012 from 2011 as a result of decreased
earnings at Batu Hijau and Yanacocha. The 2011 decrease over 2010 was a result of decreased earnings at Batu Hijau, partially offset by higher earnings at Yanacocha and the required March 2010 partial divestiture of shares in Batu Hijau.

Equity income (loss) of affiliates

was as follows:

We have a 46.94% interest in Minera La Zanja, S.R.L. (“La Zanja”), near the city of Cajamarca, Peru. The
remaining interest is held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”). Newmont received dividends of $19 during 2012 from its interest in La Zanja.

We have a 43.50% interest in Euronimba Ltd. (“Euronimba”), with the remaining interests held by BHP Billiton (43.50%) and Areva
(13%). Euronimba owns 95% of the Nimba iron ore project located in the Republic of Guinea, which is in the early stages of development.

The AGR Matthey Joint Venture (“AGR”), a gold refinery in which Newmont held a 40% interest, was dissolved on March 30, 2010.

Loss from discontinued operations

include Holloway Mining Company, which owned the Holt-McDermott property (“Holt
property”) that was sold to St. Andrew Goldfields Ltd. (“St. Andrew”) in 2006. In 2009, the Superior Court issued a decision finding Newmont Canada Corporation (“Newmont



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Canada”) liable for a sliding scale royalty on production from the Holt property, which Newmont Canada appealed. In 2010, we recognized a $28 charge, net of tax benefits of $12, related to
these legal claims. In 2011, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the Superior Court ruling resulting in an additional $136 charge, net of tax benefits of $7. In 2012, we recognized a $76 charge, net of tax benefits of $4, reflecting the impact of
higher gold prices on our estimated future royalty liability.

Other comprehensive loss,

net of tax was $161 in 2012 and included
non-cash adjustments for a $164 net loss in value of marketable securities primarily related to Canadian Oil Sands Trust and Gabriel Resources Ltd., partially offset by gains related to Regis Resources Ltd., a $14 net gain on the translation of
subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $51 net loss related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments as a result of utilizing a lower discount rate, and a $40 net gain on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges
due mainly to foreign currency hedge gains.

Other comprehensive income,

net of tax was $456 in 2011 and included non-cash adjustments for a $195 net loss in value of marketable securities primarily related to Canadian Oil Sands Trust and
Gabriel Resources Ltd., a $8 net gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $60 net loss related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments primarily as a result of utilizing a lower discount
rate and lower than expected return on plan assets, and a $209 net loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges due mainly to a loss on forward starting swap contracts partially offset by foreign currency hedge gains.

Other comprehensive
income,

net of tax was $484 in 2010 and included non-cash adjustments for a $269 net gain in value of marketable securities primarily related to Gabriel Resources Ltd. and Regis Resources Ltd., a $98 net gain on the translation of subsidiaries
with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $13 net loss related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments primarily as a result of utilizing a lower discount rate, and a $130 net gain on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges
due mainly to foreign currency hedge gains.

5 thousand ounces in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, from our non-consolidated interest in Duketon.

2012 compared to 2011

Consolidated gold ounces produced decreased 5% due to:

•

lower production from Asia Pacific due to continued Phase 6 waste mining and processing lower grade stockpiles at Batu Hijau, lower ore availability at Tanami,
and mine sequencing at Waihi; and

•

lower production from Africa due to lower mill throughput and grade; partially offset by

•

higher production from South America due to higher mill grade and recovery partially offset by lower leach placement; and

•

higher production from North America due to higher throughput at Mill 6, Juniper Mill, and Twin Creeks Autoclave and the startup of the Emigrant mine.

Consolidated copper pounds produced decreased 34% due to continued Phase 6 waste mining at Batu Hijau, partially
offset by higher throughput at Boddington.

Attributable gold ounces produced decreased 4% due to lower production from Batu Hijau,
Tanami, and Waihi, partially offset by higher production from South America. Lower attributable copper pounds produced also resulted from lower production at Batu Hijau.

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated gold ounce sold increased 15% due to lower production from Batu Hijau, Tanami, and Waihi, higher royalty and waste mining costs, partially offset by lower
co-product allocation of costs to gold.

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated copper pound sold increased 86% due to lower production from Batu Hijau, higher waste mining at Batu Hijau, higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington,
coupled with higher co-product allocation of costs to copper.

2011 compared to 2010

Consolidated gold ounces produced decreased 8% due to:

•

lower production from South America due to lower leach placement at Yanacocha from changes in mine sequencing; and

•

lower production from Asia Pacific due to higher waste stripping in Phase 6 at Batu Hijau, resulting in processing lower grade stockpiled material; partially
offset by

•

higher production from North America due to a full year of Soledad-Dipolos production at La Herradura in 2011; and

•

higher production from Africa due to a full year of production from the Amoma pit at Ahafo.

Consolidated copper pounds produced decreased 41% due to higher waste stripping in Phase 6 at Batu Hijau resulting in processing lower grade
stockpiled material, partially offset by higher grade and throughput at Boddington.

Attributable gold ounces produced decreased 4% due
to lower production from Batu Hijau and Yanacocha, partially offset by higher production from La Herradura. Lower attributable copper pounds produced also resulted from lower production at Batu Hijau.

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated gold ounce sold increased 22% due to lower production from Batu Hijau and Yanacocha, higher
royalty and waste mining costs, higher co-product allocation of costs to gold and a stronger Australian dollar, partially offset by higher silver and copper by-product

credits.

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated copper pound sold increased 58% due to lower production from Batu Hijau, higher waste mining at Batu Hijau and higher mill maintenance
costs at Boddington, partially offset by lower co-product allocation of costs to copper.

We expect 2013 attributable gold production of
approximately 4.8 to 5.1 million ounces, primarily due to lower production at Batu Hijau as it continues to process lower grade stockpiled ore during Phase 6 stripping and lower production at Yanacocha, partially offset by new production at
Akyem expected in late 2013. Consolidated

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce for 2013 are expected to be approximately $675 to $750 due to lower production at Batu Hijau and Yanacocha combined with higher expected costs for energy, labor and
contracted services.

All-in sustaining cost

(sum of costs applicable to sales, copper credits, G&A, exploration expense, advanced projects and R&D, other expense, and sustaining capital) is expected to be $1,100 to $1,200 per ounce.
We expect 2013 attributable copper production of approximately 150 to 170 million pounds at consolidated

Costs applicable to sales

per pound of approximately $2.25 to $2.50 due to lower production at Batu Hijau.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

Foreign currency exchange rates can increase or decrease profit margins and

Costs applicable to sales

to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies. Such fluctuations have not had a material impact on
our revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. Approximately 51%, 43% and 36% of our

Costs applicable to sales

were paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. Our

Costs applicable to sales

are most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. Variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate historically have been strongly
correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Changes in costs at Australian locations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian
locations. No assurance, however, can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future.

Variations in foreign currency exchange rates increased

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce $4, net of hedging, in 2012 compared to 2011, and
increased

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce $9, net of hedging, in 2011 from 2010, primarily due to movements in the Australian dollar.

We hedge a portion of our forecasted Australian dollar denominated operating expenditures. At December 31, 2012, we have hedged 76%, 61%, 41%, 24% and 7% of our forecasted Australian denominated operating
costs in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, at an average rate of 0.94, 0.92, 0.91, 0.91 and 0.91, respectively.

Foreign
currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves. However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact
our cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced as certain proven and probable reserves
may no longer be economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management’s long-term view of the applicable exchange rate.
Future reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily result in reduced gold or copper sales and increased amortization and, depending on the level of reduction, could also result in impairments of property, plant and mine development,
mineral interests and/or goodwill.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided from (used in) financing activities

was $689 in 2012, compared to $(854) and $(915) in 2011 and 2010, respectively, for the reasons explained below.

Proceeds from debt, net.

During 2012, we received net proceeds from debt of $3,524, including $1,479 from the issuance
of Senior Notes due in 2022, $983 from the issuance of Senior Notes due in 2042, $180 from the PTNNT revolving credit facility and $1,246 under our Revolving Credit Facility. Proceeds from the issuance of debt were partially offset by the settlement
of forward starting interest rate swaps of $362.

During 2011, we borrowed $2,041 under our revolving credit facility and paid debt
issuance costs of $30.

At December 31, 2012, $394 of the $3,000 revolving credit facility was used to secure the issuance of
letters of credit, primarily supporting reclamation obligations (see

“Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements”

below) and $0 was used in outstanding borrowings.

net.

We received proceeds of $24, $40 and $60 during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, from the issuance of common stock.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Sale of noncontrolling interests.

In March 2010, NTPBV completed the
sale of 7% of shares in PTNNT to a third party buyer. This transaction reduced our ownership interest in PTNNT to 31.5%. Cash proceeds from the sale was $229 with our 56.25% share being $129 and the remaining balances paid to our NTPBV partner.

Acquisition of noncontrolling interests.

In June 2010, PTPI, an unrelated noncontrolling shareholder of
PTNNT, completed the sale of a 2.2% interest in PTNNT to PTIMI. To enable the transaction to proceed, we released our rights to the dividends payable on this 2.2% interest and released our security interest in the associated shares. We agreed
to advance certain funds to PTIMI to enable it to purchase the 2.2% interest in exchange for (i) a pledge of their share of PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax, and (iii) a commitment
to support the application of Newmont standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine. The funds that we advanced to PTIMI and which it paid to PTPI for the shares were used by PTPI to reduce its outstanding loan balance with us. Upon
completion of this transaction, PTPI requested and was allowed to make additional draw-downs under our agreement with PTPI. In December 2012, we advanced certain funds to PTPI in accordance with the loan agreement. Our economic interest in
PTPI’s and PTIMI’s combined 20% ownership interest in PTNNT remains at 17% and did not change as a result of these transactions.

Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests.

We paid dividends of $3, $117 and $462 to noncontrolling interests during
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The payments in 2011 included $15 of Indonesian withholding taxes related to dividends paid to noncontrolling interests in December 2010. The dividends paid in 2010 included $100 for our NTPBV partner’s share
of the interest sold in Batu Hijau during that year.

Dividends paid to common stockholders.

We paid annual
dividends of $1.40, $1.00 and $0.50 per common share during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Additionally, Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, paid annual dividends of C$1.40, C$1.00 and C$0.52 during 2012,
2011 and 2010, respectively. On February 20, 2013, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.425 per share, payable March 28, 2013 to holders of record at the close of business on March 13, 2013. Total dividends paid to common
stockholders were $695, $494 and $246 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Discontinued Operations

Net operating cash used in discontinued operations

was $16 in 2012, compared to $7 and $13 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Discontinued
operations in 2012 and 2011 relate to payments on the Holt property royalty. The 2010 amounts related to the Kori Kollo operation in Bolivia which was sold in 2009.

Corporate Revolving Credit Facility

Effective May 20, 2011, the Company entered
into a new uncollateralized $2,500 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks. This new revolving credit facility replaced the existing revolving credit facility which was cancelled upon the effectiveness of the new facility. The
new facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars and contains a letter of credit sub-facility. The new facility originally matured in May 2016. Facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company’s senior, uncollateralized,
long-term debt. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a market based rate plus a margin determined by the Company’s credit rating. In May 2012, the Company’s Corporate Revolving Credit Facility was amended to increase the capacity
to $3,000 and extend the facility one year to 2017. At December 31, 2012, we had $0 borrowings outstanding under the facility. There was $394 and $244 outstanding in letters of credit at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Subsidiary Financings

PTNNT Revolving Credit Facility

Effective May 27, 2011, PTNNT entered into a $600 reducing revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. This facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars and matures in March 2017. The facility is
non-recourse to Newmont and certain assets of PTNNT are pledged as collateral. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 4.00%. Commitment fees currently accrue on the daily average unused amount
of the commitment of each lender at an annual rate of 2.00%. A one-time arrangement fee and other debt issuance costs, net of amortization, of $18 related to the facility were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the debt. There were
$180 in borrowings outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2012.

Debt Covenants

The Company’s senior notes contain various covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, limitation on
sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions.

The Ahafo project facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring the
Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income and mining taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of less than or equal to 4.0 and a net debt to total
capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5%.

The corporate revolving credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant
requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5% in addition to the covenants noted above. Furthermore, the corporate revolving credit facility
contains covenants limiting the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, certain change of control provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets.

The PTNNT revolving credit facility requires PTNNT to maintain certain financial ratios and to comply with certain terms and conditions with regards to its mine plan, contract of work, dividends, financing
activities, leasing, investments and other matters.

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company and its related entities were in
compliance with all debt covenants and provisions related to potential defaults.

Shelf Registration Statement

In September 2012, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which
enables the Company to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate prices. It also included the resale of an indeterminate
amount of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible securities.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Contractual Obligations

Our contractual obligations at December 31, 2012 are summarized as follows:

(1)

Amounts represent principal of $6,294 and estimated interest payments of $4,996, assuming no early extinguishment.

(2)

Amounts represent principal of $4 and estimated interest payments of $1.

(3)

Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pursuant to environmental regulations, we are
required to close our operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these reclamation and remediation obligations are reflected here. For more information regarding
reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(4)

Contractual obligations for

Employee-related benefits

include severance, workers’ participation, pension and other benefit plans. Pension plan
benefit payments beyond 2017 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included.

(5)

We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of our uncertain income tax liabilities and interest payments beyond 2013 due to uncertainties in the timing of
the effective settlement of tax positions.

(6)

Purchase obligations are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for purchase of power,
materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects.

(7)

Other includes accrued Boddington contingent consideration of $41, the accrued Holt royalty of $240 and other obligations which are not reflected in our
Consolidated Financial Statements including labor and service contracts. Payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases (as disclosed in the above table) and $1,755 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees (see Note 30 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements).



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

We also have sales agreements to sell copper and gold concentrates at market prices as follows (in
thousands of tons):

For information regarding these copper sales agreements, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk – Hedging, Provisional Copper and Gold Sales, below.

Other Liquidity Matters

At December 31, 2012, the Company had $1,561 in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1,198 was held in foreign subsidiaries and is primarily
held in U.S. dollar denominated accounts with the remainder in foreign currencies readily convertible to U.S. dollars. At December 31, 2012, $431 of the consolidated cash and cash equivalents was attributable to noncontrolling interests
primarily related to our Indonesian and Peruvian operations which is being held to fund those operations. At December 31, 2012, $315 in consolidated cash and cash equivalents ($184 attributable to Newmont) was held at certain foreign
subsidiaries that, if repatriated may be subject to withholding taxes, which would generate foreign tax credits in the U.S. As a result, we expect that there would be minimal U.S. tax liability upon repatriation of these amounts after considering
available foreign tax credits. All other amounts represent earnings that are taxed in the U.S. on a current basis due to being held in U.S. subsidiaries or non-U.S. subsidiaries that are flow-through entities for U.S. tax purposes.

We believe that our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to fund our operations and corporate activities.

Future Cash Flows

We
anticipate significant future capital expenditures, funding of exploration and advanced projects, debt repayments and dividends to both common shareholders and noncontrolling interests will impact

Net cash used in investing activities

and

Net cash used in financing activities

and may exceed

Net cash provided by operations

. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices as
well as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. We may determine that it is necessary or appropriate to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects or sell assets. Additional financing
may not be available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering equity securities, may involve substantial dilution to existing stockholders. In the event of lower gold and copper
prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities, retire or service all outstanding debt
and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. For information on our long-term debt, capital lease obligations and operating leases, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the realized prices of gold and copper. For information on the sensitivity of our

Net
cash provided by operations

to metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk – Metal Prices.

Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Australian dollar. Accordingly, we have entered into
derivative instruments to reduce the volatility of

Costs applicable to sales

in Asia Pacific. For information concerning the sensitivity of our

Costs applicable to sales

to changes in foreign



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

currency exchange rates, see Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above. For information on the sensitivity of our

Net cash provided from operations

to
foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk – Foreign Currency.

Net cash provided from operations

will also be impacted in 2013 as a result of planned contributions of $80
for our post-retirement benefit programs.

Based on expected attributable production of between 4.8 and 5.1 million ounces of gold
and between 150 and 170 million pounds of copper in 2013, we do not anticipate reasonably expected variations in our production profile alone to influence our ability to pay our debt and other obligations in 2013.

Environmental

Our
mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but
cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, $1,341 and $1,070, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently, recently producing or developmental stage mineral properties,
of which $62 is classified as a current liability. For more information on the Company’s reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Based upon our best
estimate of our liability for these matters, $198 and $170 were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We spent $39, $15 and $23 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, for environmental obligations related to
former, primarily historic, mining activities, and have classified $20 as a current liability. Expenditures for 2012 related primarily to the Con mine in Canada which was acquired as part of the Miramar acquisition, the San Luis property in
Colorado, the Mt. Leyshon property in Australia, which is a legacy Normandy site, and Resurrection, a mine site in Leadville, Colorado. Expenditures for 2011 related primarily to the Con mine, the Mt. Leyshon property in Australia, and the Dawn mill
site in Washington State. Expenditures for 2010 related primarily to the Con mine in Canada, the Mt. Leyshon property in Australia, the Dawn mill site and Resurrection. For more information on the Company’s obligations associated with former
mining activities, see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Included in capital expenditures were $207, $172 and $118 in
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of

Forward-Looking Statements

The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These measures should
not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Adjusted net income

Management of the Company uses

Adjusted net income

to evaluate the Company’s operating performance, and for planning and forecasting
future business operations. The Company believes the use of

Adjusted net income

allows investors and analysts to compare results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production
and sale of minerals to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items. Management’s determination of the components of

Adjusted net income

are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on
a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts.

Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders

is reconciled to

Adjusted net income

as follows:

Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound

Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales
of gold and copper by gold ounces or copper pounds sold, respectively. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on both a consolidated and attributable to Newmont basis. Attributable costs applicable to sales are
based on our economic interest in production from our mines. For operations where we hold less than a 100% economic share in the production, we exclude the share of gold or copper production attributable to the noncontrolling interest. We include
attributable costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound to provide management, investors and analysts with information with which to compare our performance to other gold producers. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound statistics are intended to
provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not
necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.

Net attributable costs applicable to sales per ounce measures the benefit of copper produced in conjunction with gold, as a credit against the cost of producing gold. A number of other gold producers present their
costs net of the contribution from copper and other non-gold sales. We believe that including a measure on this basis provides management, investors and analysts with information with which to compare our performance to other gold producers, and to
better assess the overall performance of our business. In addition, this measure provides information to enable investors and analysts to understand the importance of non-gold revenues to our cost structure.

Operating margin per ounce/pound

Operating margin per ounce/pound are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by subtracting the costs applicable to sales per
ounce of gold and per pound of copper from the average realized gold price per ounce and copper price per pound, respectively. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Operating margin
per ounce/pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Metal Price

Changes in the market price of gold significantly affect our profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors,
such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; the strength of the U.S. dollar; inflation, deflation, or other general price instability; and global mine production levels. Changes in the
market price of copper also affect our profitability and cash flow. Copper is traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the
commodity or by currency exchange rates.

Foreign Currency

Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar may affect our profitability and cash flow. Foreign currency exchange
rates can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and U.S. currencies and U.S. and foreign country economic conditions. In addition to our operations in the United States, we have assets or operations in
Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Mexico and New Zealand. All of our operations sell their metal production based on U.S. dollar gold and copper prices. Fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can increase
or decrease profit margins and

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. The Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate has had the greatest impact on our

Costs applicable to
sales

, as measured in U.S. dollars. However, variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate have historically been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or decreases in costs
at Australian gold operations due to exchange rate changes have



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in U.S. dollars for such locations. No assurance can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to
be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future, or that short-term changes in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will not have an impact on our profitability and cash flow. Foreign currency exchange rates in relation
to the U.S. dollar have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves in the past. However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that
impact our cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, profitability, cash flows and the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced. The
extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management’s long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. For information concerning the
sensitivity of our

Costs applicable to sales

to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition-Results of Consolidated
Operations-Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above.

Hedging

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes in gold and copper prices by selling our production at spot market prices.
Consequently, we do not hedge our gold and copper sales. We have and will continue to manage certain risks associated with commodity input costs, interest rates and foreign currencies using the derivative market.

By using derivatives, we are affected by credit risk, market risk and market liquidity risk. Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail
to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. We mitigate credit risk by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties, limiting the amount of exposure to each counterparty, and monitoring the
financial condition of the counterparties. Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a derivative might be adversely affected by a change in underlying commodity prices, interest rates, or currency exchange rates, and that this in turn affects
our financial condition. We manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. We mitigate this potential risk to our financial condition by establishing trading
agreements with counterparties under which we are not required to post any collateral or make any margin calls on our derivatives. Our counterparties cannot require settlement solely because of an adverse change in the fair value of a derivative.
Market liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative cannot be eliminated quickly, by either liquidating it or by establishing an offsetting position. Under the terms of our trading agreements, counterparties cannot require us to immediately settle
outstanding derivatives, except upon the occurrence of customary events of default such as covenant breeches, including financial covenants, insolvency or bankruptcy. We further mitigate market liquidity risk by spreading out the maturity of our
derivatives over time.

Cash Flow Hedges

We utilize foreign currency contracts to reduce the variability of the US dollar amount of forecasted foreign currency expenditures caused by changes in exchange rates. We hedge a portion of our A$ and NZ$
denominated operating expenditures which results in a blended rate realized each period. The hedging instruments are fixed forward contracts with expiration dates ranging up to five years from the date of issue. The principal hedging objective is
reduction in the volatility of realized period-on-period $/A$ and $/NZ$ rates, respectively. We also utilize foreign currency contracts to hedge a portion of the Company’s A$ denominated capital expenditures related to the construction of the
Akyem project in Africa. The hedging instruments are fixed forward contracts with expiration dates ranging up to three years. We use diesel contracts to reduce the variability of our operating cost exposure related to diesel prices of fuel consumed
at our Nevada operations. All of the currency, diesel and forward

During 2011, we entered into forward starting interest rate swap contracts with a total notional value of $2,000. These contracts hedged movements
in treasury rates related to a debt issuance that occurred in the first quarter of 2012. On March 8, 2012, we closed the sale of $2,500 senior notes consisting of 3.5% senior notes due 2022 in the principal amount of $1,500 (10-year notes),
and 4.875% senior notes due 2042 in the principal amount of $1,000 (30-year notes). As a result, the forward-starting interest rate swaps were settled for $362, of which $349 represented the effective portion of the hedging instrument included

We had $222 fixed to floating swap contracts designated as a hedge

Provisional Copper and Gold Sales

Our provisional copper and gold sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting
purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the gold and copper concentrates at the prevailing indices’ prices at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market
through earnings each period prior to final settlement.

The average LME copper price was $3.61 per pound during 2012, compared with the
Company’s recorded average provisional price of $3.60 before mark-to-market adjustments and treatment and refining charges. During 2012, decreasing copper prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market gain of $22 ($0.10 per pound). At
December 31, 2012, Newmont had copper sales of 57 million pounds priced at an average of $3.60 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. Each $0.10 change in the price for provisionally priced sales would have an
approximate $2 effect on our

The average London P.M. fix for gold was $1,669 per
ounce during 2012, compared with the Company’s recorded average provisional price of $1,668 per ounce before mark-to-market adjustments and treatment and refining charges. During 2012, increasing gold prices resulted in a provisional pricing
mark-to-market gain of $4 ($1 per ounce). At December 31, 2012, Newmont had gold sales of 77,000 ounces priced at an average of $1,665 per ounce, subject to final pricing over the next several months. Each $25 change in the price for
provisionally priced gold sales would have an approximate $1 effect on our

Fixed and Variable Rate Debt

Our debt portafolio consisted of 96% and 98% of fixed rate debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively. The carrying value of fixed rate debt increase primarily due to a two part public offering of $1,500 and $1,000 uncollateralized senior notes in March 2012, partially offset by the maturity of the Company’s 2012 Convertible Senior
Notes. Our fixed rate debt exposure at December 31, 2012 and 2011 is summarized as follows:

ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the
Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2012. In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

. Based upon its assessment, management concluded that, at December 31, 2012, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company’s assessment of internal control over
financial reporting at December 31, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Newmont Mining Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2012, based
on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing
under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 1    THE
COMPANY

Newmont Mining Corporation and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “Newmont” or the
“Company”) predominantly operates in the mining industry, focused on the exploration for and production of gold and copper. The Company has significant assets in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, New Zealand and Mexico.
The cash flow and profitability of the Company’s operations are significantly affected by the market price of gold, and to a lesser extent, copper. The prices of gold and copper are affected by numerous factors beyond the Company’s
control.

References to “A$” refers to Australian currency, “C$” to Canadian currency and “NZ$” to New
Zealand currency.

NOTE 2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of Estimates

The
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires the
Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates utilized in impairment calculations
and units-of-production amortization calculations; environmental, reclamation and closure obligations; estimates of recoverable gold and other minerals in stockpile and leach pad inventories; estimates of fair value for certain reporting units and
asset impairments (including impairments of goodwill, long-lived assets and investments); write-downs of inventory, stockpiles and ore on leach pads to net realizable value; post-employment, post-retirement and other employee benefit liabilities;
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets; reserves for contingencies and litigation; and the fair value and accounting treatment of financial instruments including marketable securities and derivative instruments. The Company bases its estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results will differ from these amounts estimated in these financial statements.

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Newmont Mining Corporation and more-than-50%-owned subsidiaries that it controls and entities over which control is achieved through means other than
voting rights. The Company also includes its pro-rata share of assets, liabilities and operations for unincorporated joint ventures in which it has an interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The
functional currency for the majority of the Company’s operations, including the Australian operations, is the U.S. dollar.

The
Company follows

FASB Accounting Standards Codification

(“ASC”) guidance for identification and reporting of entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. The guidance defines such entities as
Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”). The Company has identified VIEs in connection with our interests in PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT” or “Batu Hijau”) due to certain funding arrangements and shareholder
commitments. The Company has financing arrangements with PT Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”) and PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama (“PTIMI”), unrelated noncontrolling shareholders of PTNNT, whereby the Company agreed to advance certain funds
to them in exchange for (i) a pledge of their combined 20% share of PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax, (iii) a commitment from them to support the



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

application of our standards to the operation of Batu Hijau and (iv) as of September 16, 2011 in respect of PTPI only, powers of attorney to vote and sell PTNNT shares in support of the
pledge, enforceable in an event of default as further security for the funding. The Company has determined itself to be the primary beneficiary of these entities, controls the operations of Batu Hijau and has the obligation to absorb losses and the
right to receive benefits that are significant to PTNNT. Therefore, the Company consolidates PTNNT in its financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Because of the short maturity of these investments, the carrying amounts
approximate their fair value. Cash and cash equivalents are invested in United States Treasury securities and money market securities. Restricted cash is excluded from cash and cash equivalents and is included in other current and long-term assets.

Investments

Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each reporting date. Investments in incorporated entities
in which the Company’s ownership is greater than 20% and less than 50%, or which the Company does not control through majority ownership or means other than voting rights, are accounted for by the equity method and are included in long-term
assets. The Company accounts for its marketable security investments as available for sale securities in accordance with ASC guidance on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. The Company periodically evaluates whether
declines in fair values of its investments below the Company’s carrying value are other-than-temporary in accordance with ASC guidance. The Company’s policy is to generally treat a decline in the investment’s quoted market value that
has lasted continuously for more than six months as an other-than-temporary decline in value. The Company also monitors its investments for events or changes in circumstances that have occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair
value of the investment and evaluates qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss and the Company’s ability to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs to determine if the
decline in value of an investment is other-than-temporary. Declines in fair value below the Company’s carrying value deemed to be other-than-temporary are charged to earnings.

Stockpiles, Ore on Leach Pads and Inventories

As described below, costs that are incurred in or benefit the productive process are accumulated as stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories. Stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories are carried at the
lower of average cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price of the product based on current and long-term metals prices, less the estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to
sale. Write-downs of stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories to net realizable value are reported as a component of

Costs applicable to sales

. The current portion of stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories is determined based on
the expected amounts to be processed within the next 12 months. Stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories not expected to be processed within the next 12 months are classified as long-term. The major classifications are as follows:



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Stockpiles

Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of
contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data) and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated to stockpiles based on current
mining costs incurred including applicable overhead and amortization relating to mining operations, and removed at each stockpile’s average cost per recoverable unit.

Ore on Leach Pads

The recovery of gold from certain gold oxide ores is achieved through the
heap leaching process. Under this method, oxide ore is placed on leach pads where it is treated with a chemical solution, which dissolves the gold contained in the ore. The resulting gold-bearing solution is further processed in a plant where the
gold is recovered. Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per
estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad.

The estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the
quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of
the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete.

Although
the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the
ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, the Company’s operating results have not been
materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of gold on its leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in
write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a prospective basis.

In-process Inventory

In-process inventories represent materials that are currently in the process of being converted to a saleable product. Conversion processes vary
depending on the nature of the ore and the specific processing facility, but include mill in-circuit, flotation, leach and carbon-in-leach in circuits. In-process material is measured based on assays of the material fed into the process and the
projected recoveries of the respective plants. In-process inventories are valued at the average cost of the material fed into the process attributable to the source material coming from the mines, stockpiles and/or leach pads plus the in-process
conversion costs, including applicable amortization relating to the process facilities incurred to that point in the process.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Precious Metals Inventory

Precious metals inventories include gold doré and/or gold bullion. Precious metals that result from the Company’s mining and processing
activities are valued at the average cost of the respective in-process inventories incurred prior to the refining process, plus applicable refining costs.

Concentrate Inventory

Concentrate inventories represent copper and gold concentrate available
for shipment or in transit for further processing when the sales process has not been completed. The Company values concentrate inventory at the average cost, including an allocable portion of support costs and amortization. Costs are added and
removed to the concentrate inventory based on tons of concentrate and are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.

Materials and Supplies

Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Cost includes applicable taxes and freight.

Property, Plant and Mine Development

Facilities and equipment

Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that
extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and recorded at cost. The facilities and equipment are amortized using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated productive
lives of such facilities. These estimated productive lives do not exceed the related estimated mine lives, which are based on proven and probable reserves.

Mine Development

Mine development costs include engineering and metallurgical studies,
drilling and other related costs to delineate an ore body, the removal of overburden to initially expose an ore body at open pit surface mines and the building of access ways, shafts, lateral access, drifts, ramps and other infrastructure at
underground mines. Costs incurred before mineralization is classified as proven and probable reserves are expensed and classified as

Exploration

or

Advanced projects, research and development

expense. Capitalization of mine development
project costs, that meet the definition of an asset, begins once mineralization is classified as proven and probable reserves.

Drilling
and related costs are capitalized for an ore body where proven and probable reserves exist and the activities are directed at obtaining additional information on the ore body or converting mineralized material to proven and probable reserves. All
other drilling and related costs are expensed as incurred. Drilling costs incurred during the production phase for operational ore control are allocated to inventory costs and then included as a component of

Costs applicable to sales

.

The cost of removing overburden and waste materials to access the ore body at an open-pit mine prior to the production phase are
referred to as “pre-stripping costs.” Pre-stripping costs are capitalized during the development of an open-pit mine. Where multiple open pits exist at a mining complex utilizing common processing facilities, pre-stripping costs are
capitalized at each pit. The removal, production, and sale of de minimis saleable materials may occur during development and are recorded as

Other income

, net of incremental mining and processing costs.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

The production phase of an open-pit mine commences when saleable minerals, beyond a de minimis
amount, are produced. Stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that are included as a component of inventory to be recognized in

Costs applicable to sales

in the same period as the revenue
from the sale of inventory. The Company’s definition of a mine and the mine’s production phase may differ from that of other companies in the mining industry resulting in incomparable allocations of stripping costs to deferred mine
development and production costs. Other mining companies may expense pre-stripping costs associated with subsequent pits within a mining complex. Other mining companies may capitalize stripping costs incurred in connection with the production phase.

Mine development costs are amortized using the units-of-production (“UOP”) method based on estimated recoverable ounces or
pounds in proven and probable reserves. To the extent that these costs benefit an entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated life of the ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the
life of that area are amortized over the estimated life of that specific ore block or area.

Mineral Interests

Mineral interests include acquired interests in production, development and exploration stage properties. The mineral interests are capitalized at
their fair value at the acquisition date, either as an individual asset purchase or as part of a business combination.

The value of such
assets is primarily driven by the nature and amount of mineralized material believed to be contained in such properties. Production stage mineral interests represent interests in operating properties that contain proven and probable reserves.
Development stage mineral interests represent interests in properties under development that contain proven and probable reserves. Exploration stage mineral interests represent interests in properties that are believed to potentially contain
mineralized material consisting of (i) mineralized material such as inferred material within pits; measured, indicated and inferred material with insufficient drill spacing to qualify as proven and probable reserves; and inferred material in
close proximity to proven and probable reserves; (ii) around-mine exploration potential such as inferred material not immediately adjacent to existing reserves and mineralization, but located within the immediate mine area; (iii) other
mine-related exploration potential that is not part of measured, indicated or inferred material and is comprised mainly of material outside of the immediate mine area; (iv) greenfields exploration potential that is not associated with any other
production, development or exploration stage property, as described above; or (v) any acquired right to explore or extract a potential mineral deposit. The Company’s mineral rights generally are enforceable regardless of whether proven and
probable reserves have been established. In certain limited situations, the nature of a mineral right changes from an exploration right to a mining right upon the establishment of proven and probable reserves. The Company has the ability and intent
to renew mineral interests where the existing term is not sufficient to recover all identified and valued proven and probable reserves and/or undeveloped mineralized material.

Asset Impairment

The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of
the assets, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity
prices (considering current and historical



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

prices, trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs, capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine plans. Existing proven and probable reserves and
value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in
determining whether the assets are impaired. The term “recoverable minerals” refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates
of recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management’s relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are
identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. The Company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on numerous assumptions and it is possible that actual future cash flows will be
significantly different than the estimates, as actual future quantities of recoverable minerals, gold and other commodity prices, production levels and costs and capital are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized, net of treatment and refining charges, from a sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is
determinable, the product has been delivered, the title has been transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured. Revenues from by-product sales are credited to

Costs applicable to sales

as a by-product
credit.

Concentrate sales are initially recorded based on 100% of the provisional sales prices. Until final settlement occurs,
adjustments to the provisional sales prices are made to take into account the mark-to-market changes based on the forward prices for the estimated month of settlement. For changes in metal quantities upon receipt of new information and assay, the
provisional sales quantities are adjusted as well. The principal risks associated with recognition of sales on a provisional basis include metal price fluctuations between the date initially recorded and the date of final settlement. If a
significant decline in metal prices occurs between the provisional pricing date and the final settlement date, it is reasonably possible that the Company could be required to return a portion of the sales proceeds received based on the provisional
invoice.

The Company’s sales based on a provisional price contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the
host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward exchange price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market
through earnings each period prior to final settlement.

Income and Mining Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of
the Company’s liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. This method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for the Company, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect.
The Company derives its deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year. Mining taxes represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and
are classified as income taxes; as such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. With respect to the earnings that the Company derives from the operations of its consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the earnings are
indefinitely



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

reinvested, no deferred taxes have been provided on the unremitted earnings (including the excess of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for financial reporting purposes over
the tax basis of such equity) of these consolidated companies.

The Company’s deferred income tax assets include certain future tax
benefits. The Company records a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when it believes, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax
asset will not be realized.

The Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex
tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax
audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The
Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company’s current
estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the
ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in

Income and mining tax expense

.

Reclamation and Remediation Costs

Reclamation obligations are recognized when incurred and recorded as liabilities at fair value. The liability is accreted over time through periodic charges to earnings. In addition, the asset retirement cost is
capitalized as part of the asset’s carrying value and amortized over the life of the related asset. Reclamation costs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions
to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. The estimated reclamation obligation is based on when spending for an existing disturbance is expected to occur. The Company reviews, on an annual basis, unless otherwise
deemed necessary, the reclamation obligation at each mine site in accordance with ASC guidance for reclamation obligations.

Future
remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on management’s best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and
monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised.

Foreign
Currency

The functional currency for the majority of the Company’s operations, including the Australian operations, is the
U.S. dollar. All monetary assets and liabilities where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are translated at current exchange rates and the resulting adjustments are included in

forward starting swap contracts to hedge against changes in treasury rates. The fair value of derivative contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. To the extent these hedges are effective
in offsetting forecasted cash flows from production costs (the “effective portion”), changes in fair value are deferred in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

. Amounts deferred in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

are
reclassified to income when the hedged transaction has occurred. The ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in

Other income, net

in each period. Cash transactions related to the Company’s
derivative contracts accounted for as hedges are classified in the same category as the item being hedged in the statement of cash flows.

When derivative contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges are settled, accelerated or restructured before the maturity date of the contracts, the
related amount in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

at the settlement date is deferred and reclassified to earnings, as applicable, when the originally designated hedged transaction impacts earnings.

The fair value of derivative contracts qualifying as fair value hedges are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. Changes in fair
value are recorded in income in each period, consistent with recording changes to the mark-to-market value of the underlying hedged asset or liability in income. Prior to maturity in May 2011, changes in the mark-to-market value of the effective
portion of interest rate swaps utilized by the Company to swap a portion of its fixed rate interest rate risk to floating rate risk were recognized as a component of

Interest expense, net

.

Newmont assesses the effectiveness of the derivative contracts periodically using either regression analysis or the dollar offset approach, both
retrospectively and prospectively, to determine whether the hedging instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged items. The Company will also assess periodically whether the hedging instruments are
expected to be highly effective in the future. If a hedging instrument is not expected to be highly effective, the Company will stop hedge accounting prospectively. In those instances, the gains or losses remain in

Accumulated other comprehensive
income

until the hedged item affects earnings.

Net Income per Common Share

Basic and diluted income per share are presented for

Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders

and for

Income from continuing
operations attributable to Newmont stockholders

. Basic income per share is computed by dividing

income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of outstanding common shares for the period, including the exchangeable
shares (see Notes 12 and 23). Diluted income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts that may require the issuance of common shares in the future were converted. Diluted income per share is
computed by increasing the weighted-average number of outstanding common shares to include the additional common shares that would be outstanding after conversion and adjusting net income for changes that would result from the conversion. Only those
securities or other contracts that result in a reduction in earnings per share are included in the calculation.

Comprehensive Income

In addition to

Net income, Comprehensive income (loss)

includes all changes in equity during a period, such as adjustments to minimum pension
liabilities, foreign currency translation adjustments, the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and cumulative unrecognized changes in fair value of marketable securities
available-for-sale or other investments, except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners.

Recently Adopted
Accounting Pronouncements

Goodwill Impairment

In September 2011, ASC guidance was issued related to goodwill impairment. Under the updated guidance, an entity will have the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two-step
goodwill impairment test. If the Company believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required.
Otherwise, no further testing is required. The update does not change how the Company performs the two-step impairment test under previous guidance. The Company’s January 1, 2012 adoption of the guidance had no impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Fair Value Accounting

In May 2011, ASC guidance was issued related to disclosures around fair value accounting. The updated guidance clarifies different components of
fair value accounting including the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts, measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity’s shareholders’ equity and disclosing quantitative
information about the unobservable inputs used in fair value measurements that are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s January 1, 2012 adoption of the updated guidance had no impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Comprehensive Income

In June 2011, the ASC guidance was issued related to comprehensive income. Under the updated guidance, an entity will have the option to present the
total of comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In addition, the update required certain disclosure requirements when reporting other comprehensive income.
The update does not change the items reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to income. The Company adopted the new guidance and its deferral and opted to present the total of
comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements effective for its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2011. The early adoption had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Reporting of Amounts reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

In February
2013, ASC guidance was issued related to items reclassified from

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

. The new standard requires either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements:(i) the effect of
significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source and (ii) the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. The update is effective for the Company’s fiscal
year beginning

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

January 1, 2013 with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the updated guidance to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities

In November 2011, ASC guidance was issued related to disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities. The new standard requires disclosures to
allow investors to better compare financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP with financial statements prepared under IFRS. The update is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2013, and interim periods within
those annual periods. Retrospective application is required.

In January 2013, ASC guidance was issued to clarify that the disclosure
requirements are limited to derivatives, repurchase agreements, and securities lending transactions to the extent that they are (i) offset in the financial statements or (ii) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar
agreement. The Company does not expect the updated guidance to have an impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 4    RECLAMATION AND REMEDIATION

The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the
protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations to protect public health and the environment and believes its operations are in
compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.
Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements.

The Company’s reclamation and remediation expenses consisted of:

Reclamation expense decreased in 2012, primarily due to a final agreement on remediation requirements for the
Midnite Mine site and land purchases around the Mt Leyshon mine in 2011 that did not occur in 2012.

At December 31, 2012 and 2011,
$1,341 and $1,070, respectively, were accrued for reclamation obligations relating to mineral properties. In addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining
activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, $198 and $170, respectively, were accrued for such obligations. These amounts are also
included in

Reclamation and remediation liabilities

fund.

Additions to the reclamation liability in 2011 of $176 include $139 for currently or recently producing properties due mainly to
increased water treatment costs and additional heap leach facilities at Yanacocha, an increase in the tailings area at Boddington, an expansion of the operating footprint at Batu Hijau and $37 for historic mining operations primarily related to
additional water management costs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

The Company’s income and mining tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying
the United States statutory corporate income tax rate for the following reasons:

Factors that Significantly Impact Effective Tax Rate

In 2012, the Company made an election to convert a non-U.S. subsidiary to a partnership or flow-through entity for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. As a result of this election, the Company recognized a capital loss equal to the difference between the Company’s tax basis in the non-U.S. subsidiary and the fair market value of the assets held by the non-U.S. subsidiary. The
Company recognized a current U.S. federal income tax benefit for that portion of the capital loss that was used to offset other non-related 2012 capital gains and that will be used to absorb 2010 and 2011 net capital gains for which the Company will
submit a carry-back refund claim. The Company recorded a $635 deferred tax asset for the remaining capital loss which will be carried forward to future years. As discussed below, the Company also recorded a related valuation allowance of $635 due to
its analysis of the future realization of this deferred tax asset under a more likely than not standard.

In 2010 and 2011, the Company
converted certain non-U.S. entities to U.S. entities for U.S. income tax purposes. As a result of the elections, the subsidiaries are treated as flow-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The restructurings in 2011 and 2010 resulted
in the recording of a deferred tax asset, calculated as the difference between fair market valuations of the subsidiaries compared to the underlying financial statement basis in the assets.

Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion that may exceed our tax basis in our mineral reserves) are available to us under the
income tax laws of the United States for operations conducted in the United States or through branches and partnerships owned by U.S. subsidiaries included in our consolidated United States income tax return. The deductions are highly sensitive to
the price of gold and other minerals produced by the Company.

The Company reviews the measurement of its deferred tax assets at each
balance sheet date. All available evidence, both positive and negative, is considered in determining whether, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Valuation allowance totaled $1,626 at December 31, 2012, and $977 at December 31, 2011, and covered all of the Company’s capital loss carryforward balances, and a portion of the



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Company’s non-U.S. net operating losses. The Company’s valuation allowance increased overall by $649 during 2012. This net increase consists of $635 for the U.S. capital loss carryover
generated on the election to convert a non-U.S. subsidiary to a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, $81 for current year losses generated in Canada and $20 for unrealized losses in discontinued operations, offset by a net $87 of
valuation allowance released and recorded directly to equity and/or other comprehensive income.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, the
Company reclassified certain income based state and provincial taxes from

Costs applicable to sales to Income and mining tax expense

. Tax expense increased due to the inclusion of such taxes as

Income and mining tax expense

. The
reclassification resulted in $77, $42 and $33 (net of federal benefit) increase to income and mining taxes for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Components of the Company’s deferred income tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

Net deferred income tax assets and liabilities consist of:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

In connection with the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company determined a change in the presentation of certain deferred tax liabilities was necessary to conform to the guidance outlined in ASC 740. This guidance states that all current deferred tax assets
and current deferred tax liabilities should be offset and reported as a single amount and all non-current deferred tax assets and non-current deferred tax liabilities should be offset and reported as a single amount for each tax-paying component of
the Company and within a particular tax jurisdiction. The revised change in presentation to appropriately net these balances for 2011 is detailed below and relates primarily to the acquisition of the Fronteer group of companies in 2011.

Company’s Unrecognized Tax Benefits

At December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $399, $336 and $116 of total gross unrecognized tax benefits, respectively. A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

At December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, $120, $137 and $45, respectively, represent the amount of unrecognized
tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective income tax rate.

The Company operates in numerous countries
around the world and is subject to, and pays annual income taxes under, the various income tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, and others are
defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country. The Company has historically filed, and continues to file, all required income tax returns and paid the taxes reasonably determined to be due. The tax rules and regulations in many
countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

From time to time, the Company is subject to a review of its historic income tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the
interpretation or application of certain rules to the Company’s business conducted within the country involved.

In 2010 and 2012,
PTNNT, the Company’s partially owned subsidiary in Indonesia, received income tax assessment letters for 2008 and 2010 for additional amounts of $119 and $22, respectively. The Company has since paid the 2008 and 2010 amounts in full, including
penalties. PTNNT is vigorously defending its positions through all available processes. PTNNT believes it is more likely than not that it will prevail based on prior experience and has recorded a corresponding current receivable of $119 and long
term receivable of $22.

In 2011, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued a Technical Advice Memorandum (“TAM”) to the
Company regarding the U.S. income tax treatment of the Price Capped Forward Sales Contracts settled in cash in 2007. The TAM provides guidance which is unfavorable to the Company. The Company is vigorously defending its positions through all
processes available to it and believes it should prevail.

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S.
federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2005. As a result of
(i) statute of limitations that will begin to expire within the next 12 months in various jurisdictions, and (ii) possible settlements of audit-related issues with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions with respect to which none of
the issues are individually significant, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of its net unrecognized income tax benefits will decrease between $15 to $20 in the next 12 months.

The Company’s continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its income and
mining tax expense. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the total amount of accrued income-tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $14 and $11, respectively. During 2012, the Company recorded through the
Statements of Consolidated Income an additional $4 of interest and penalties. During 2011, the Company released through the Statements of Consolidated Income an additional $1 of interest and penalties. During 2010, the Company accrued through the
Statements of Consolidated Income an additional $1 of interest and penalties.

Tax Loss Carryforwards, Foreign Tax Credits, and
AMT Credits

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had (i) $741 and $739 of net operating loss carry forwards,
respectively; and (ii) $405 and $259 of tax credit carry forwards, respectively. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, $281 and $315, respectively, of net operating loss carry forwards are attributable to operations in Australia, Ghana and France
for which current tax law provides no expiration period. The remaining net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2032. Valuation allowances have been recorded on net operating loss carryforwards where the Company believes
based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that the net operating losses will not be realized.

Tax credit carry
forwards for 2012 and 2011 of $249 and $155 consist of foreign tax credits available in the United States; substantially all such credits not utilized will expire at the end of 2022. Other credit carry forwards at the end of 2012 and 2011 in the
amounts of $156 and $104, respectively, represent alternative minimum tax credits attributable to the Company’s U.S. operations for which the current tax law provides no period of expiration.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Differences in tax rates and other foreign income tax law variations make the ability to fully
utilize all available foreign income tax credits on a year-by-year basis highly dependent on the price of the gold and copper produced by the Company and the costs of production, since lower prices or higher costs can result in having insufficient
sources of taxable income in the United States to utilize all available foreign tax credits. Such credits have limited carry back and carry forward periods and can only be used to reduce the United States income tax imposed on foreign earnings
included in the annual United States consolidated income tax return.

Other

Newmont intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from certain foreign operations. Accordingly, non-U.S. income and withholding taxes for which
deferred taxes might otherwise be required have not been provided on a cumulative amount of temporary differences. For this purpose, any difference between the tax basis in the stock of a consolidated subsidiary and the amount of the
subsidiary’s net equity determined for financial reporting purposes related to investments in foreign subsidiaries is immaterial to the Company. The Company does not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to satisfy liquidity needs arising in
the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with any debt service requirements.

Discontinued operations include Holloway Mining Company, which owned the Holt-McDermott property (“Holt property”) that
was sold to St. Andrew Goldfields Ltd. (“St. Andrew”) in 2006. In 2009, the Superior Court issued a decision finding Newmont Canada Corporation (“Newmont Canada”) liable for a sliding scale royalty on production from the Holt
property, which was upheld in 2011 by the Ontario Court of Appeal.

For the years ended 2012, 2011 and 2010 the Company recorded charges
of $76, $136 and $28, net of tax benefits of $4, $7 and $12, respectively.

Net cash used in discontinued operations

was $16, $7
and $13 for the year ended 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Discontinued operations in 2012 and 2011 relate to payments on the Holt property royalty. The 2010 amounts related to the Kori Kollo operation in Bolivia which was sold in 2009.

NOTE 11    NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

Newmont has a 51.35% ownership interest in Yanacocha, with the remaining interests held by Buenaventura
(43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).

In June 2010, PTPI completed the sale of an approximate 2.2% interest in
PTNNT to PTIMI. To enable the transaction to proceed, the Company released its rights to the dividends payable on this 2.2% interest and released the security interest in the associated shares. The Company further agreed to advance certain
funds to PTIMI to enable it to purchase the interest in exchange for (i) a pledge of their 2.2% share of PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax, and (iii) a commitment from them to support
the application of Newmont standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine. The funds that the Company advanced to PTIMI and which it paid to PTPI for the shares were used by PTPI to reduce its outstanding loan balance with the Company. Upon
completion of this transaction, PTPI requested and was allowed to borrow additional funds under the Company’s agreement with PTPI. The Company’s economic interest in PTPI’s and PTIMI’s combined 20% interest in PTNNT remains
at 17% and did not change as a result of these transactions.

In March 2010, the Company (through Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V.
(“NTPBV”)) completed the sale and transfer of shares for a 7% interest in PTNNT to PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”) in compliance with divestiture obligations under the Contract of Work, reducing NTPBV’s ownership interest
to 56% from 63%. In 2009, the Company (through NTPBV) completed the sale and transfer of shares for a 17% interest in PTNNT to PTMDB in compliance with divestiture obligations under the Contract of Work, reducing NTPBV’s ownership interest to
63% from 80%. The 2010 and 2009 share transfers resulted in gains of approximately $16 (after tax of $33) and $63 (after tax of $115), respectively, that were recorded as

NOTE 12    NEWMONT EQUITY AND INCOME PER SHARE

Newmont Common Stock

In September 2012, Newmont filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 under which it can issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of debt
securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate prices. It also included the resale of an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible
securities.

Treasury Stock

Treasury stock is acquired by the Company when certain restricted stock awards vest or are forfeited. At vesting, a participant has a tax liability and, pursuant to the participant’s award agreement, may elect
withholding of restricted stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The withheld or forfeited stock is accounted for as treasury stock and carried at the par value of the related common stock.

Exchangeable Shares

In connection with the acquisition of Franco-Nevada Corporation (“Franco”) in February 2002, certain holders of Franco common stock
received 0.8 of an exchangeable share of Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited (formerly Franco) for each share of common stock held. These exchangeable shares are convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of Newmont common stock
on a one-for-one basis, and entitle holders to dividends and other rights economically equivalent to holders of Newmont common stock. On December 15, 2011, as a result of a plan of arrangement, holders of exchangeable shares received, at their
election, for each existing exchangeable share, one new exchangeable share of Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited or one share of Newmont common stock. In connection with the plan of arrangement, 1.6 million shares were converted from
exchangeable shares to Newmont common stock and 4.9 million new exchangeable shares were issued. At December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the value of the remaining exchangeable shares was included in

Net Income per Common Share

Basic income per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted income per common share is computed similarly to basic income per common share except that the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is increased to include the number of additional common shares
that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.

Options to purchase 2 million shares of common stock at average exercise prices ranging from $57 to $58 were
excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average common shares because their exercise prices exceeded the average price of the Company’s common stock for each year in the three year period ended December 31, 2012.

In July 2007, Newmont issued $1,150 of Convertible Senior Notes that, if converted in the future, may have a dilutive effect on the Company’s
weighted average number of common shares. The notes issued in 2007 are convertible, at the holder’s option, equivalent to a conversion price of $44.78 (25,678,470 shares of common stock) per share of common stock. Under the convertible note
indenture, Newmont is required to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes in cash and may elect to settle the remaining conversion obligation (Newmont average share price in excess of the conversion price), if any, in cash,
shares or a combination thereof. The effect of contingently

convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share is calculated under the net share settlement method in accordance with ASC guidance. The average price of the Company’s common stock for
the year ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 exceeded the conversion price for the notes issued in 2007 and therefore, 3, 8 and 6 million additional shares, respectively, were included in the computation of diluted weighted average
common shares for the year ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

In connection with the 2007 Convertible Senior
Notes offering, the Company entered into Call Spread Transactions which included the purchase of call options and the sale of warrants. As a result of the Call Spread Transactions, the conversion price of $44.78 was effectively increased to $58.41.
Should the warrant transactions become dilutive to the Company’s earnings per share (Newmont’s average share price exceeds $58.41) the effect of the warrant transactions on diluted earnings per share will be calculated in accordance with
the net share settlement method.

In February 2012, the holders of the Company’s 2012 Convertible Senior Notes exercised their
election to convert the notes. The Company elected to pay the $172 conversion premium with cash, and as a result no common shares were issued.

NOTE 13     EMPLOYEE-RELATED BENEFITS

Pension and Other Benefit Plans

The Company provides defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees. Benefits are generally based on years of service and the employee’s
average annual compensation. Various international pension plans are based on local laws and requirements. Pension costs are determined annually by independent actuaries and pension contributions to the qualified plans are made based on funding
standards established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

The Company sponsors retiree health care
plans that provide prescription drug benefits to eligible retirees that our plans’ actuaries have determined are actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In 2010, Congress passed certain measures of healthcare reform which changed the
tax-free status of Medicare Part D subsidies and eliminated the impact on the post-retirement ABO.

The following tables provide a reconciliation of changes in the plans’ benefit obligations

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Yield curves matching our benefit obligations were derived using a model based on high quality
corporate bond data from Bloomberg. The model develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds whose projected cash flows match the projected benefit payments of the plan. The resulting curves were used to identify a
discount rate for the Company of 4.30% and 5.35% at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, based on the timing of future benefit payments. The expected long-term return on plan assets used for each period in the three years ended December
2012 was made based on an analysis of the asset returns over multiple time horizons for the Company’s actual plan and for other comparable U.S. corporations. At December 31, 2012, Newmont has estimated the expected long term return on plan
assets to be 7.75% in calculating its benefit obligation, which will be used in determining future net periodic benefit cost. Determination of the long-term return on plan assets is a result of considering the most recent capital market forecasts
and the plans’ current allocation as well as the actual return on plan assets as compared to the expected return on assets over the last 5 years. The average actual return on plan assets during the 24 years ended December 31, 2012
approximated 9%.

The pension plans employ several independent investment firms which invest the assets of the plans in certain approved
funds that correspond to specific asset classes with associated target allocations. The goal of the pension fund investment program is to achieve prudent actuarial funding ratios while maintaining acceptable risk levels. The investment performance
of the plans and that of the individual investment firms is measured against recognized market indices. The performance of the pension funds are monitored by an investment committee comprised of members of the Company’s management, which is
advised by an independent investment consultant. With the exception of global capital market economic risks, the Company has identified no significant portfolio risks associated to asset classes. The following is a summary of the target asset
allocations for 2012 and the actual asset allocation at December 31, 2012.

The following table sets forth the Company’s pension plan assets measured at fair value by level within the
fair value hierarchy. Assets are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

The pension plans’ cash and cash equivalents are classified within Level 1 of the fair value
hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. The cash equivalent instruments that are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets are primarily money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities.

The pension plans’ commingled fund investments are classified within Level 2. The funds are managed by several fund managers and are valued at
the net asset value per share for each fund. Although the majority of underlying assets in the funds consist of actively traded equity securities and bonds, the unit of account is considered to be at the fund level, and therefore, the investments
are classified as Level 2. At December 31, 2012, the underlying assets of the commingled funds consist of U.S. equity investments (25%), international equity investments (27%), fixed income investments (40%), and other investments (8%).

The assumed health care cost trend rate to measure the expected cost of benefits was 7.70% for 2013, 6.90% for 2014, 6.40% for 2015,
5.90% for 2016, 5.50% for 2017 and approximately 5.00% for each year thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost

made to other benefit plan participants are expected to be as follows: $4 in 2013, $5 in 2014, $5 in 2015, $6 in 2016, $6 in 2017, and $38 in total over the five years from 2018 through 2021.

Savings Plans

The
Company has two qualified defined contribution savings plans, one that covers salaried and non-union hourly employees and one that covers substantially all hourly union employees. In addition, the Company has one non-qualified supplemental savings
plan for salaried employees whose benefits under the qualified plan are limited by federal regulations. When an employee meets eligibility requirements, the Company matches 100% of employee contributions of up to 6% of base salary for the salaried
and hourly union plans. The Company makes a contribution between 5.0% and 7.5% (based on continuous years of service) to each non-union hourly employee’s retirement contribution account at its sole discretion. Matching contributions are made
with Newmont stock; however, no holding restrictions are placed on such contributions, which totaled $20 in 2012, $17 in 2011, and $15 in 2010.

NOTE 14    STOCK BASED COMPENSATION

The Company has stock incentive plans for executives and eligible employees. Stock incentive awards include restricted stock units, performance
leveraged stock units, financial performance stock bonuses, and strategic stock units. Prior to 2012, the Company also granted options to purchase shares of stock with exercise prices not less than fair market value of the underlying stock at the
date of grant. At December 31, 2012, 7,842,793 shares were available for future stock incentive plan awards.

Employee Stock
Options

Stock options granted under the Company’s stock incentive plans vest over periods of three years or more and are
exercisable over a period of time not to exceed 10 years from the grant date. The value of each option award is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of
subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option award and stock price volatility. The expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination experience.
Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock at the grant date. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected
forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those options expected to vest. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our recorded stock based compensation expense would have been different from that reported. The Black-Scholes option
pricing model used the following weighted-average assumptions:

Other Stock Based Compensation

The Company grants restricted stock units to executives and eligible employees upon achievement of certain financial and operating results.
Restricted stock units vest over periods of three years or more. Prior to vesting, holders of restricted stock units do not have the right to vote the underlying shares; however, executives accrue dividend equivalents on their restricted stock
units, which are paid at the time the restricted stock units vest. The restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture risk and other restrictions. Upon vesting, the employee is entitled to receive one share of the Company’s common stock for
each restricted stock unit. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company granted 1,062,819, 586,944 and 483,408 restricted stock units, respectively, at a weighted-average fair market value of $51, $57 and $52, respectively, per underlying share of the
Company’s common stock. At December 31, 2012, 970,284, 303,372 and 86,626 shares remain unvested for the 2012, 2011 and 2010 grants, respectively.

The Company grants performance leveraged stock units (“PSUs”) to eligible executives, based upon certain measures of shareholder return. In 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Company granted 241,448, 102,313, and
204,732 PSUs, respectively, at a weighted-average fair market value of $77, $76, and $69, respectively. The actual number of PSUs that vest are determined at the end of a three year performance period. At December 31, 2012, 241,448, 102,313,
and 25,730 PSUs remained unvested for the 2012, 2011, and 2010 grants.

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Through 2012, the Company granted financial performance stock bonuses to eligible executives upon
achievement of certain financial and operating results, based on a targeted number of shares at the beginning of each performance period. At the end of the performance period, one third of the bonus was paid in common stock and two-thirds of the
bonus were paid in restricted stock units that vest in equal annual increments at the second and third anniversaries of the start of the performance period. In 2012, 2011, and 2010 the Company granted 35,245, 42,932, and 64,646 common shares,
respectively, and 70,501, 85,632, and 129,302 restricted stock units, respectively, included in the restricted stock unit grants above at a fair market value of $59, $55, and $50 per underlying share of the Company’s common stock, respectively,
under the financial performance stock bonus plan.

Beginning in 2013, the Company will grant strategic stock units (“SSUs”) to
eligible executives, based upon certain measures of earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), based on a targeted number of shares at the beginning of each performance period. At the end of the performance
period, one third of the SSUs will be issued without restriction in the form of common stock, and two-thirds of the bonus will be paid in restricted stock units that vest in equal annual increments at the second and third anniversaries of the start
of the performance period. In 2012, the Company recorded SSU expense from the service inception date for the expected 2013 grant.

The
total intrinsic value of other stock based compensation awards that vested in 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $37, $33 and $28, respectively. At December 31, 2012, there was $65 of unrecognized compensation costs related to the unvested other stock
based compensation awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years.

The
Company recognized stock based compensation as follows:

NOTE 15    ACQUISITIONS

On April 6, 2011, Newmont acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Fronteer Gold Inc. (“Fronteer”). Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition, shareholders of Fronteer received C$14.00 in cash

at $62. In connection with the acquisition, the Company incurred $67 of transaction costs in 2009 of which $15 of these costs were paid at December 31, 2010.

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the estimated fair value of the unpaid contingent consideration was approximately $41 and $54, respectively. Changes to the estimated fair value resulting from periodic
revaluations are recorded to

. This contingent royalty is capped at $100 in aggregate payments, and at June 30, 2012, the Company increased the accrual to the maximum of $100. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company
paid $25, $30 and $4, respectively, related to the contingent consideration. The range of remaining undiscounted amounts the Company could pay is between $0 and $41.

NOTE 16    FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING

Fair value accounting establishes a fair
value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Level 2

Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability;
and

Level 3

Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).

The following table sets forth the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
(at least annually) by level within the fair value hierarchy. As required by accounting guidance, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The Company’s cash equivalent instruments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because
they are valued using quoted market prices. The cash equivalent instruments that are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets are primarily money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities.

The Company’s marketable equity securities are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and as such are classified within Level 1
of the fair value hierarchy. The securities are segregated based on industry. The fair value of the marketable equity securities is calculated as the quoted market price of the marketable equity security multiplied by the quantity of shares held by
the Company.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

The Company’s marketable debt securities are mainly commingled fund investments that are
classified within Level 2 with the unit of account considered to be at the fund level. Therefore, the investments are classified as Level 2.

The Company’s marketable debt securities include investments in auction rate securities and asset backed commercial paper. The Company reviews the fair value for auction rate securities and asset backed
commercial paper on a quarterly basis. The auction rate securities are traded in markets that are not active, trade infrequently and have little price transparency. See table below which sets forth a summary of the quantitative and qualitative
information related to the significant unobservable inputs used in the calculation of the fair value.

The Company’s net trade
receivable from provisional copper and gold concentrate sales, subject to final pricing, is valued using quoted market prices based on forward curves and, as such, is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company’s derivative instruments are valued using pricing models and the Company generally uses similar models to value similar
instruments. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit spreads, measures of volatility, and correlations of such inputs. The Company’s derivatives trade in liquid markets, and
as such, model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgment. Such instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The estimated value of the Boddington contingent royalty was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model which simulates future gold and copper prices and costs applicable to sales. This contingent royalty is
capped at $100, and at June 30, 2012, the Company increased the accrual to the maximum of $100. The Boddington contingent royalty is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See table below which sets forth a summary of the
quantitative and qualitative information related to the significant unobservable inputs used in the calculation of the fair value.

The
estimated fair value of the Holt sliding scale royalty was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The sliding scale royalty liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See table below which sets forth a summary of

At December 31, 2012, the assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
represent 1% and 100% of the total assets and liabilities measured at fair value, on a recurring basis.

NOTE 17    DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS

The Company’s strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes in gold and copper prices by selling its
production at spot market prices. Consequently, the Company does not hedge its gold and copper sales. The Company continues to manage certain risks associated with commodity input costs, interest rates and foreign currencies using the derivative
market. All of the derivative instruments utilized by the Company and described below were transacted for risk management purposes and qualify as cash flow or fair value hedges.

Cash Flow Hedges

The foreign currency, diesel and forward starting swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, and as such, the effective
portion of unrealized changes in market value have been recorded in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

and are reclassified to income during the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains
and losses from hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings

.

Foreign Currency
Contracts

Newmont utilizes foreign currency contracts to reduce the variability of the US dollar amount of forecasted foreign
currency expenditures caused by changes in exchange rates. Newmont hedges a portion of the Company’s A$ and NZ$ denominated operating expenditures which results in a blended rate realized each period. The hedging instruments are fixed forward
contracts with expiration dates ranging up to five years from the date of issue. The principal hedging objective is reduction in the volatility of realized period-on-period $/A$ and $/NZ$ rates, respectively and the related reduction in volatility
of the underlying operating and capital costs as a result of currency changes.

In June 2011, Newmont began hedging a portion of the
Company’s A$ denominated capital expenditures related to the Akyem project in Africa utilizing fixed forward contracts with expiration dates up to three years.

In July 2011, Newmont began hedging a portion of the Company’s A$ denominated capital
expenditures related to the planned construction of a mine shaft at Tanami in Australia utilizing foreign currency contracts. In November 2012, Newmont decided to defer further construction of the project to evaluate the impact of the Auron
discovery on the overall life of the mine plan. As a result, the forecasted transaction is no longer probable to occur within the original expected time frame, and hedge accounting has been discontinued. This resulted in a $3 gain reclassified from

Forward Starting Swap Contracts

During 2011, Newmont entered into forward starting interest rate swap contracts with a total notional value of $2,000. These contracts hedged
movements in treasury rates related to a debt issuance that occurred in the first quarter of 2012. On March 8, 2012, Newmont closed its sale of $2,500 senior notes consisting of 3.5% senior notes due 2022 in the principal amount of $1,500
(10-year notes), and 4.875% senior notes due 2042 in the principal amount of $1,000 (30-year notes). As a result, the forward-starting interest rate swaps were settled for $362, of which $349 represented the effective portion of the hedging
instrument included in

Provisional Copper and Gold Sales

The Company’s provisional copper and gold sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for
accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the gold and copper concentrates at the prevailing indices’ prices at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to
market through earnings each period prior to final settlement.

The average LME copper price was $3.61 per pound during 2012, compared
with the Company’s recorded average provisional price of $3.60 before mark-to-market losses and treatment and refining charges. During 2012, changes in copper prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market gain of $22 ($0.10 per
pound). At December 31, 2012, Newmont had copper sales of 57 million pounds priced at an average of $3.60 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months.

The average London P.M. fix for gold was $1,669 per ounce during 2012, compared with the Company’s recorded average provisional price of
$1,668 per ounce before mark-to-market gains and treatment and refining charges. During 2012, changes in gold prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market gain of $4 ($1 per ounce). At December 31, 2012, Newmont had gold sales of
77,000 ounces priced at an average of $1,665 per ounce, subject to final pricing over the next several months.

investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position:

Included in the tables above are the unrealized losses of $13 and $26 at December 31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively, related to the Company’s investments in asset backed commercial paper, auction rate securities and marketable equity securities. While the fair values of these investments are below their respective cost, the Company views these
declines as temporary. The Company intends to hold its investment in auction rate securities and asset backed commercial paper until maturity or such time that the market recovers and therefore considers these losses temporary.

Write-down of property, plant and mine development

totaled $52, $2,084 and $6 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 2012 write-down was
primarily due to an impairment of the FALC JV diamond project as well as write-downs of non-essential surface equipment at Conga. The 2011 write-down was primarily due to an impairment related to the Hope Bay project after evaluating existing
development options and economic feasibility for the project compared with other projects and development opportunities within the Company’s wider project pipeline. The amount of the Hope Bay write-down was recorded in 2011 at fair value based
on the estimated recoverable value, net of transportation and selling costs utilizing the liquidation model.

Corporate Revolving Credit Facility

Effective May 20, 2011, the Company entered into a new uncollateralized $2,500 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks. This new revolving credit facility replaced the existing revolving
credit facility which was cancelled upon the effectiveness of the new facility. The new facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars and contains a letter of credit sub-facility. The new facility originally matured in May 2016. Facility fees
vary based on the credit ratings of the Company’s senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a market based rate plus a margin determined by the Company’s credit rating. At December 31,
2012, we had $0 in borrowings outstanding under the facility. There was $394 and $244 outstanding in letters of credit at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

In May 2012, the Company’s Corporate Revolving Credit Facility was amended to increase the capacity to $3,000 and extend the facility one year to 2017. The available capacity under the Corporate Revolving
Credit Facility prior to the amendment was $2,500.

NOTE 29    CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements are presented to satisfy disclosure requirements of Rule 3-10(e) of
Regulation S-X resulting from the inclusion of Newmont USA Limited (“Newmont USA”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newmont, as a co-registrant with Newmont on debt securities issued under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed
under the Securities Act of 1933 under which securities of Newmont (including debt securities guaranteed by Newmont USA) may



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

be issued (the “Shelf Registration Statement”). In accordance with Rule 3-10(e) of Regulation S-X, Newmont USA, as the subsidiary guarantor, is 100% owned by Newmont, the guarantees are
full and unconditional, and no other subsidiary of Newmont guaranteed any security issued under the Shelf Registration Statement. There are no restrictions on the ability of Newmont or Newmont USA to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend or
loan.

At December 31, 2012, errors were identified in the previously reported condensed consolidating financial statements
resulting from incorrectly applying the provisions of Rule 3-10(e) of Regulation S-X related to the presentation of the financial information of its subsidiary guarantor, Newmont USA. In the previously reported information, the Company presented
Newmont USA on a consolidated basis with its non-guarantor subsidiaries and under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X Newmont USA should have presented its investment in subsidiaries based upon its proportionate share of its non-guarantor subsidiaries’
net assets (similar to the equity method of accounting). In addition, the Company corrected the Newmont Mining Corporation column for investments in subsidiaries previously presented in the Eliminations column. The tables following the revised
condensed consolidating financial statements illustrate the effects of the errors, which relate to the columns for Newmont Mining Corporation, Newmont USA, Other Subsidiaries and Eliminations, on previously reported condensed consolidating financial
information as of December 31, 2011 and for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.

The errors to the Newmont USA column
for the incorrect presentation resulted in no change in previously reported line items for net income attributable to Newmont and stockholders’ equity. It did however have a significant impact on the previously reported cash balance, and cash
flow from operations, investing and financing activities of Newmont USA as a result of the deconsolidation of its subsidiaries and the one line proportionate accounting pick up. Further, the Other Subsidiaries column changed by corresponding
adjustments and to give effect to intercompany balances to include the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Newmont USA and the Eliminations column changes as a result of the above changes. In addition, the Company corrected an error in the Newmont Mining
Corporation column related to stockholders’ equity and investment in subsidiaries. This was a result of a gain associated with a partial sale of a subsidiary that was previously included in the Eliminations column. The cash flow statement in
the Newmont Mining Corporation column was revised to reflect earnings from subsidiaries, net of dividends received.

The Company
concluded these errors were not material individually or in the aggregate to any of the previously issued financial statements taken as a whole. These errors had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of Newmont or any debt covenants and
had no impact on the ability of Newmont’s subsidiaries to dividend cash to Newmont. The impact of these corrections to the applicable prior year periods is reflected in the revised financial information and notes below.

The Company will revise the March 31, 2012, June 30, 2012 and September 30, 2012 financial statements to reflect the revisions
discussed above in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods in 2013.

NOTE 30     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

General

The Company follows ASC guidance in determining its accruals and disclosures with respect to loss contingencies. Accordingly, estimated losses from loss contingencies are accrued by a charge to income when
information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability could be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal expenses associated with the contingency are expensed
as incurred. If a loss contingency is not probable or reasonably estimable, disclosure of the loss contingency is made in the financial statements when it is at least reasonably possible that a material loss could be incurred.

Operating Segments

The Company’s operating segments are identified in Note 3. Except as noted in this paragraph, all of the Company’s commitments and
contingencies specifically described in this Note 30 relate to the Corporate and Other reportable segment. The PT Newmont Minahasa Raya and PTNNT matters relate to the Asia Pacific reportable segment. The Yanacocha matters relate to the South
America reportable segment.

Environmental Matters

The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These
laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations are in compliance with applicable laws and
regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.

Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, $1,341 and
$1,070, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently producing mineral properties in accordance with asset retirement obligation guidance. The current portions of $62 and $47 at December 31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively, are included in

Other current liabilities

.

In addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning
environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. The Company believes that the related environmental obligations
associated with these sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the compliance required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon the Company’s best estimate of its
liability for these matters, $198 and $170 were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These amounts are included in

Other current liabilities

and

Reclamation and remediation liabilities

.
Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 114% greater or 5% lower than the amount accrued at December 31, 2012. The
amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are recorded in

Reclamation and remediation

in the period estimates are revised.

Details about certain of the more significant matters involved are discussed below.

Newmont Mining Corporation

Empire Mine.

On July 19, 2012, the California Department of Parks and Recreation (“Parks”) served
Newmont, New Verde Mines LLC, Newmont North America Exploration Limited, Newmont Realty Company and Newmont USA Limited with a complaint for damages and declaratory relief under CERCLA, specifically for costs associated with water treatment at the
Empire Mine State Park and for a declaration that Newmont is liable for past and future response costs, as well as indemnification to Parks. In 1975 Parks purchased the Empire Mine site in Grass Valley, California from Newmont to create a historic
state park featuring the mining of the Empire Mine. Parks has operated the Empire Mine Site for over 35 years. Newmont intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit. Newmont cannot reasonably predict the outcome of this matter.

Newmont USA Limited — 100% Newmont Owned

Ross-Adams Mine Site.

By letter dated June 5, 2007, the U.S. Forest Service notified Newmont that it had expended approximately $0.3 in response costs to address environmental
conditions at the Ross-Adams mine in Prince of Wales, Alaska, and requested Newmont USA Limited pay those costs and perform an Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (“EE/CA”) to assess what future response activities might need to be
completed at the site. Newmont intends to vigorously defend any formal claims by the EPA. Newmont has agreed to perform the EE/CA. Newmont cannot reasonably predict the likelihood or outcome of any future action against it arising from this matter.

Hope Bay Mining Ltd. — 100% Newmont Owned

In July 2011 Environment Canada Enforcement Officers discovered a release of drill water containing calcium chloride on Hope Bay Mining Ltd. (“HBML”) property in Nunavut, Canada. Orbit Garant Drilling
Inc. (“Orbit”) operated a diamond drill rig on the HBML property. On February 13, 2013, HBML received service of a summons and charges from a Judge for Nunavut alleging violation of the

Fisheries Act

relating to the
release of drill water and alleged failure to report a discharge. Newmont cannot reasonably predict the outcome of this matter.

PT
Newmont Minahasa Raya (“PTNMR”) — 80% Newmont Owned

On March 22, 2007, an Indonesian non-governmental
organization named Wahana Lingkungan Hidup Indonesia (“WALHI”) filed a civil suit against PTNMR, the Newmont subsidiary that operated the Minahasa mine in Indonesia, and Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources and
Ministry of Environment, alleging pollution from the government-approved and permitted disposal of mill tailings into Buyat Bay, and seeking a court order requiring PTNMR to fund a 25-year monitoring program in relation to Buyat Bay. In December
2007, the court ruled in PTNMR’s favor and found that WALHI’s allegations of pollution in Buyat Bay were without merit. In March 2008, WALHI appealed this decision to the Indonesian High Court. On January 27, 2010, the Indonesian High
Court upheld the December 2007 ruling in favor of PTNMR. On May 17, 2010, WALHI filed an appeal of the January 27, 2010 Indonesian High Court ruling seeking review from the Indonesian Supreme Court. In December 2012, the Supreme Court
notified the parties that it issued its decision rejecting WALHI’s appeal and ruling in favor of PTNMR. The decision is final and binding. Independent sampling and testing of Buyat Bay water and fish, as well as area residents, conducted by the
World Health Organization and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization confirm that PTNMR has not polluted the Buyat Bay environment, and, therefore, has not adversely affected the fish in Buyat Bay or the health
of nearby residents. Ongoing monitoring of seawater quality by an Independent

Scientific Panel continues to confirm that PTNMR’s operations have not adversely affected the environment. The Company remains steadfast that it has not caused pollution or health problems.

Other Legal Matters

Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) — 51.35% Newmont Owned

Choropampa

.     In June 2000, a transport contractor of Yanacocha spilled approximately 151 kilograms of elemental
mercury near the town of Choropampa, Peru, which is located 53 miles (85 kilometers) southwest of the Yanacocha mine. Elemental mercury is not used in Yanacocha’s operations but is a by-product of gold mining and was sold to a Lima firm for use
in medical instruments and industrial applications. A comprehensive health and environmental remediation program was undertaken by Yanacocha in response to the incident. In August 2000, Yanacocha paid under protest a fine of 1,740,000 Peruvian soles
(approximately $0.5) to the Peruvian government. Yanacocha has entered into settlement agreements with a number of individuals impacted by the incident. As compensation for the disruption and inconvenience caused by the incident, Yanacocha entered
into agreements with and provided a variety of public works in the three communities impacted by this incident. Yanacocha cannot predict the likelihood of additional expenditures related to this matter.

Additional lawsuits relating to the Choropampa incident were filed against Yanacocha in the local courts of Cajamarca, Peru, in May 2002 by over
900 Peruvian citizens. A significant number of the plaintiffs in these lawsuits entered into settlement agreements with Yanacocha prior to filing such claims. In April 2008, the Peruvian Supreme Court upheld the validity of these settlement
agreements, which the Company expects to result in the dismissal of all claims brought by previously settled plaintiffs. Yanacocha has also entered into settlement agreements with approximately 350 additional plaintiffs. The claims asserted by
approximately 200 plaintiffs remain. In 2011, Yanacocha was served with 23 complaints alleging grounds to nullify the settlements entered into between Yanacocha and the plaintiffs. Yanacocha has answered the complaints and the court has dismissed
several of the matters and the plaintiffs have filed appeals. All appeals were referred to the Civil Court of Cajamarca, which affirmed the decisions of the lower court judge. The plaintiffs have filed appeals of such orders before the Supreme
Court. Yanacocha will continue to vigorously defend its position. Neither the Company nor Yanacocha can reasonably estimate the ultimate loss relating to such claims.

PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”) — 31.5% Newmont Owned

Under the Batu Hijau
Contract of Work, beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2010, a portion of PTNNT’s shares were required to be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or, second, to Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between the
following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by March 31, 2007; 37% by March 31, 2008; 44% by
March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. As PT Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an Indonesian national, owned a 20% interest in PTNNT at all relevant times, in 2006, a 3% interest was required to be offered for sale and, in each of 2007
through 2010, an additional 7% interest was required to be offered (for an aggregate 31% interest). The price at which such interests were offered for sale to the Indonesian parties was the fair market value of such interest considering PTNNT as a
going concern, as agreed with the Indonesian government. Following certain disputes and an arbitration with the Indonesian government, in November and December 2009, sale agreements were concluded pursuant to which the 2006, 2007 and 2008 shares
were sold to PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”), the nominee of the local governments, and the 2009 shares were sold to PTMDB in February 2010, resulting in PTMDB owning a 24% interest in PTNNT.

On December 17, 2010, the Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources, acting on behalf
of the Indonesian government, accepted the offer to acquire the final 7% interest in PTNNT. Subsequently, the Indonesian government designated Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (“PIP”), an agency of the Ministry of Finance, as the entity that
will buy the final stake. On May 6, 2011, PIP and the foreign shareholders entered into a definitive agreement for the sale and purchase of the final 7% divestiture stake, subject to receipt of approvals from certain Indonesian government
ministries. Subsequent to signing the agreement, a disagreement arose between the Ministry of Finance and the Indonesian parliament in regard to whether parliamentary approval was needed to allow PIP to make the share purchase. In July 2012, the
Constitutional Court ruled that parliament approval is required for PIP to use state funds to purchase the shares, which approval has not yet been obtained. Further disputes may arise in regard to the divestiture of the 2010 shares.

Effective January 1, 2011, the local government in the region where the Batu Hijau mine is located commenced the enforcement of local
regulations that purport to require PTNNT to pay additional taxes based on revenue and the value of PTNNT’s contracts. In addition, the regulations purport to require PTNNT to obtain certain export-related documents from the regional government
for purposes of shipping copper concentrate. PTNNT is required to and has obtained all export related-documents in compliance with the laws and regulations of the central government. PTNNT believes that the new regional regulations are not
enforceable as they expressly contradict higher level Indonesian laws that set out the permissible taxes that can be imposed by a regional government and all effective export requirements. PTNNT’s position is supported by Indonesia’s
Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources, Ministry of Trade, and the provincial government. To date, PTNNT has not been forced to comply with these new contradictory regional regulations. On February 4, 2011, PTNNT filed legal
proceedings seeking to have the regulations declared null and void because they conflict with the laws of Indonesia. Subsequently, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a decree declaring these local regulations to be contrary to Indonesian law and
thus unenforceable. Further disputes with the local government could arise in relation to these regulations. PTNNT intends to vigorously defend its position in this dispute.

Additionally, in September 2011, WALHI brought an administrative law claim against Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment to challenge the May 2011 renewal of PTNNT’s submarine tailings permit. PTNNT and the
regional government of KSB (“KSB”) filed separate applications for intervention into the proceedings, both of which were accepted by the Administrative Court. KSB intervened on the side of WALHI, and PTNNT joined on the side of the
Ministry of Environment. On April 3, 2012, the Administrative Court ruled in favor of the Ministry of Environment and PTNNT, finding that the Ministry of Environment properly renewed the permit in accordance with Indonesian law and regulations.
WALHI appealed the verdict. On October 2, 2012, the High Administrative Law Court rejected WALHI’s appeal, after which WALHI filed a notice to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. PTNNT will continue to defend its submarine tailings
permit and is confident that the Ministry of Environment acted properly in renewing PTNNT’s permit.

Newmont Mining Corporation
claim relating to PTNNT divestiture

Indonesian citizens apparently living in the province of Nusa Tenggara Barat filed a lawsuit
against Indonesia’s Ministry of Finance and other government officials (as defendants) and against PTNNT and the Company (as co-defendants). Plaintiffs claim that the purchase by the central government of the final 7% divestiture stake in PTNNT
violates, or would violate, their human rights. PTNNT’s alleged liability appears supposedly to arise from being a party involved in the process of divestiture, and the Company’s from being a holding company of PTNNT. The allegations
regarding alleged liability are

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

vague and unclear. Plaintiffs seek various relief, including an order requiring the defendants and co-defendants to transfer the final 7% stake to the regional government of Nusa Tenggara Barat
and a payment of approximately $247 in damages. After hearings on the matter, the Central Jakarta District Court dismissed the case on November 21, 2012. Plaintiffs did not submit an appeal within the required 14 day time period and therefore
the decision of the District Court is final and binding.

PT Pukuafu Indah Litigation

In October 2009, PTPI filed a lawsuit in the Central Jakarta District Court against PTNNT and the Indonesian government seeking to cancel a March
2009 arbitration award pertaining to the manner in which divestiture of shares in PTNNT should proceed. On October 11, 2010, the District Court ruled in favor of PTNNT and the Indonesian government finding, among other things, that PTPI lacks
standing to contest the validity of the arbitration award. PTPI filed an appeal to the High Court, which was rejected by the High Court on January 4, 2012. PTPI appealed the case to the Indonesian Supreme Court. In September 2012, PTNNT and
PTPI settled this lawsuit and PTPI revoked the appeal.

Subsequent to its initial claim, PTPI filed numerous additional lawsuits,
against Newmont Indonesia Limited (“NIL”) and Nusa Tenggara Mining Corporation (“NTMC”), a subsidiary of Sumitomo, in the South Jakarta District Court. Fundamentally, the cases all relate to PTPI’s contention that it owns,
or has rights to own, the shares in PTNNT that have been or will be divested to fulfill the requirements of the PTNNT Contract of Work and the March 2009 arbitration award. PTPI also makes various other allegations, including alleged rights in or to
the Company’s or NTMC’s non-divestiture shares in PTNNT, and PTPI asserts claims for significant damages allegedly arising from NIL’s and NTMC’s unlawful acts in transferring the divestiture shares to a third party. On
November 30, 2010, the South Jakarta District Court rendered a decision in favor of PTPI in one of the cases that included an order that NIL/NTMC transfer 31% of PTNNT shares to PTPI and pay PTPI $26 in damages and certain monetary penalties.
On August 7, 2012, the appellate court overturned the decision by the South Jakarta District Court. On June 28, 2011, the South Jakarta District Court ruled in favor of NIL and NTMC in one of PTPI’s lawsuits contending that PTPI has
rights in or to NIL’s and NTMC’s non-divestiture shares. PTPI filed an appeal. In March 2012, the District Court dismissed PTPI’s final two cases that were pending at the trial court level. PTPI filed appeals in both of these
lawsuits.

In August 2010, NIL and NVL USA Limited (“NVL”) commenced an arbitration against PTPI in the Singapore
International Arbitration Centre, as provided in relevant financing agreements, seeking declarations that PTPI has violated the release agreement by failing to dismiss its Indonesian lawsuits, that PTPI is in breach of the November 2009 loan
facility and related agreements, and that NIL and NVL are entitled to damages arising from PTPI’s and its shareholders’ conduct.

On October 1, 2010, NIL and NVL requested, based upon the release agreement, that the arbitral tribunal issue an interim order requiring PTPI and its shareholders to discontinue the various Indonesian court
proceedings and refrain from bringing additional lawsuits. On October 15, 2010, the tribunal issued an order granting NIL and NVL’s request. The order of the tribunal restrains PTPI and its agents from “proceeding with or continuing
with or assisting or participating in the prosecution of the Indonesian [s]uits” and from commencing additional proceedings relating to the same subject matter as the Indonesian lawsuits. NIL and NVL obtained an enforcement order in Singapore
courts but PTPI and its shareholders have not abided by the court order. PTPI and its shareholders’ proceedings in Singapore court to contest enforcement of the interim award were rejected by the court.

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

On April 7, 2011, the arbitral tribunal issued a final award, while keeping the proceedings
open to allow NIL and NVL to seek further relief as necessary, finding PTPI and its shareholders in breach of various provisions of the financing agreements, including the release agreement. The tribunal, for the second time, ordered PTPI and its
agents to restrain from proceeding with the Indonesian lawsuits or filing new lawsuits relating to the same subject matter. In addition, the tribunal ordered PTPI and other shareholder defendants, collectively, to pay more than $11 in damages, costs
and expenses. NIL and NVL obtained an enforcement order in Singapore courts and PTPI’s shareholders have partially complied with the order. PTPI and its shareholders did not fully comply with the court order as $10 in damages remains unpaid and
the Indonesian lawsuits continued. NIL and NVL registered the final award in the Central Jakarta District Court to seek enforcement in Indonesia.

On October 22, 2012, the Company and PTPI entered into an agreement to resolve their differences under which PTPI committed to dismiss or discontinue all of its litigation within four months. PTPI
fulfilled its commitment by effective withdrawal of all litigation against the relevant Newmont and Sumitomo parties, and NIL and NVL discontinued the Singapore arbitration and all related enforcement actions against PTPI.

NWG Investments Inc. v. Fronteer Gold Inc.

In April 2011, Newmont acquired Fronteer Gold Inc. (“Fronteer”).

Fronteer acquired NewWest
Gold Corporation (“NewWest Gold”) in September 2007. At the time of that acquisition, NWG Investments Inc. (“NWG”) owned approximately 86% of NewWest Gold and an individual named Jacob Safra owned or controlled 100% of NWG. Prior
to its acquisition of NewWest Gold, Fronteer entered into a June 2007 lock-up agreement with NWG providing that, among other things, NWG would support Fronteer’s acquisition of NewWest Gold. At that time, Fronteer owned approximately 42% of
Aurora Energy Resources Inc. (“Aurora”), which, among other things, had a uranium exploration project in Labrador, Canada.

NWG contends that, during the negotiations leading up to the lock-up agreement, Fronteer represented to NWG that Aurora would commence uranium
mining in Labrador by 2013, that this was a firm date, that Fronteer was not aware of any obstacle to doing so, that Aurora faced no serious environmental issues in Labrador and that Aurora’s competitors faced greater delays in commencing
uranium mining. NWG further contends that it entered into the lock-up agreement and agreed to support Fronteer’s acquisition of NewWest Gold in reliance upon these purported representations. On October 11, 2007, less than three weeks after
the Fronteer-NewWest Gold transaction closed, a member of the Nunatsiavut Assembly introduced a motion calling for the adoption of a moratorium on uranium mining in Labrador. On April 8, 2008, the Nunatsiavut Assembly adopted a three-year
moratorium on uranium mining in Labrador. NWG contends that Fronteer was aware during the negotiations of the NWG/Fronteer lock-up agreement that the Nunatsiavut Assembly planned on adopting this moratorium and that its adoption would preclude
Aurora from commencing uranium mining by 2013, but Fronteer nonetheless fraudulently induced NWG to enter into the lock-up agreement.

On September 24, 2012, NWG served a summons and complaint on NMC. The complaint also names Fronteer Gold Inc and Mark O’Dea as
defendants. The complaint seeks rescission of the merger between Fronteer and NewWest Gold and $750 in damages. Newmont intends to defend this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

Tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with ASC income tax guidance (see Note 8).

The Company has minimum royalty obligations on one of its producing mines in Nevada for the life of the mine. Amounts paid as a minimum royalty
(where production royalties are less than the minimum obligation) in any year are recoverable in future years when the minimum royalty obligation is exceeded. Although the minimum royalty requirement may not be met in a particular year, the Company
expects that over the mine life, gold production will be sufficient to meet the minimum royalty requirements. Minimum royalty payments payable are $60 in 2013, $38 in 2014 through 2017 and $317 thereafter.

As part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company and its affiliates are required to provide surety bonds, bank letters of credit and
bank guarantees as financial support for various purposes, including environmental reclamation, exploration permitting, workers compensation programs and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, there
were $1,755 and $1,354, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees. The surety bonds, letters of credit and bank guarantees reflect fair value as a condition of their underlying purpose and are subject to fees
competitively determined in the market place. The obligations associated with these instruments are generally related to performance requirements that the Company addresses through its ongoing operations. As the specific requirements are met, the
beneficiary of the associated instrument cancels and/or returns the instrument to the issuing entity. Certain of these instruments are associated with operating sites with long-lived assets and will remain outstanding until closure. Generally,
bonding requirements associated with environmental regulation are becoming more restrictive. However, the Company believes it is in compliance with all applicable bonding obligations and will be able to satisfy future bonding requirements, through
existing or alternative means, as they arise.

Newmont is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings related to its
business. Except in the above-described proceedings, management does not believe that adverse decisions in any pending or threatened proceeding or that amounts that may be required to be paid by reason thereof will have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

During the fiscal period covered by this report, the Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer of the Company, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Controls

The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that its books and records accurately reflect transactions and that established policies
and procedures are followed. The Company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system on a staged basis at its most significant subsidiaries around the world, excluding Indonesia. The Company began the implementation of
the ERP system in North America during the second quarter of 2012 and continued with the implementation in South America during the third quarter of 2012 and Australia/New Zealand during the fourth quarter of 2012, which resulted in a change to its
system of internal control over financial reporting. The Company is implementing the global ERP system to improve standardization and automation, and not in response to a deficiency in its internal control over financial reporting. The Company
believes that the implementation of the ERP system and related changes to internal controls will enhance its internal controls over financial reporting while providing the ability to scale its business in the future. See Item 1A, Risk Factors,
of this annual report on Form 10-K for risk factors related to the implementation and integration of information technology systems. The Company has taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial
reporting during this period of change and will continue to evaluate the operating effectiveness of related key controls during subsequent periods.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report on management’s assessment are included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
