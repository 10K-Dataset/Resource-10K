This document (including information incorporated herein by reference) contains “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which involve a degree of risk and uncertainty due to various factors affecting Newmont Mining
Corporation and our affiliates and subsidiaries. For a discussion of some of these factors, see the discussion in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this report.

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Introduction

Newmont Mining Corporation is primarily a gold producer with significant assets or operations in
the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, Bolivia, New Zealand and Mexico. As of December 31, 2006, Newmont had proven and probable gold reserves of 93.9 million equity ounces and an aggregate land position of
approximately 44,470 square miles (115,200 square kilometers). Newmont is also engaged in the production of copper, principally through its Batu Hijau operation in Indonesia. Newmont Mining Corporation’s original predecessor corporation was
incorporated in 1921 under the laws of Delaware.

Newmont’s revenues and long-lived assets are geographically distributed as follows:

(1)

Other includes Canada, Mexico, Bolivia and Turkey.

Newmont’s corporate headquarters are in Denver, Colorado, USA. In this report, “Newmont,” the “Company,” “our” and
“we” refer to Newmont Mining Corporation and/or our affiliates and subsidiaries. All dollars are in millions, except per share, per ounce, and per pound amounts.

For additional information, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Segment Information, Export Sales, etc.

Newmont has operating segments of Nevada, Yanacocha in Peru,
Australia/New Zealand, Batu Hijau in Indonesia, Africa and Other Operations comprising of smaller operations in Bolivia, Mexico and Canada. We also have a Merchant Banking Segment and an Exploration Segment. See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information relating to our business segments, our domestic and export sales, and our customers.

Products

Gold

General.

Newmont had consolidated sales of 7.4 million ounces of gold (5.9 million equity ounces) in 2006, 8.4 million ounces (6.5 million equity ounces) in 2005 and
8.6 million ounces (6.9 million equity ounces) in 2004. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, 87%, 85% and 82%, respectively, of our net revenues were attributable to


gold sales. Of our 2006 gold sales, approximately 36% came from Yanacocha, 33% from Nevada, 19% from Australia/New Zealand and 6% from Indonesia. References
in this report to “equity ounces” or “equity pounds” mean that portion of gold or copper produced, sold or included in proven and probable reserves that is attributable to our ownership or economic interest.

Most of our revenue comes from the sale of refined gold in the international market. The end product at our gold operations, however, is generally
doré bars. Doré is an alloy consisting mostly of gold but also containing silver, copper and other metals. Doré is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% pure gold. Under the terms
of refining agreements, the doré bars are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and the separately-recovered silver are credited to our account or delivered to buyers. Gold sold from Batu Hijau, and a portion of the gold from
Phoenix in Nevada, is contained in a concentrate.

Gold Uses.

Gold has two main categories of use:
fabrication and investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry.

Gold Supply.

The supply of gold consists of a combination of production from mining and the draw-down of
existing stocks of gold held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals. In recent years, mine production has accounted for 60% to 70% of the annual supply of gold.

Gold Price.

The following table presents the annual high, low and average afternoon fixing prices for gold over the past
ten years, expressed in U.S. dollars per ounce, on the London Bullion Market.

Source: Kitco and
Reuters

On February 12, 2007, the afternoon fixing price for gold on the London Bullion Market was $665 per ounce and the spot market
price of gold on the New York Commodity Exchange was $661 per ounce.

We generally sell our gold at the prevailing market price during the
month in which the gold is delivered to the customer. Our ability to sell gold at market prices is limited in some cases by hedging activities, more particularly described in Note 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and
Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable, the gold has been delivered, the title has been transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured.

Copper

General.

Newmont had consolidated sales of 434.7 million pounds of copper (229.9 million equity pounds) in 2006, 572.7 million pounds (302.8 million equity pounds) in 2005 and 683.3 million
pounds (384.3 million equity pounds) in 2004. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, 13%, 15% and 18%, respectively, of our net revenues



were attributable to copper sales. As of December 31, 2006, Newmont had a 52.875% economic interest (a 45% ownership interest) in the Batu Hijau
operation in Indonesia, which began production in 1999. Production at Batu Hijau is in the form of a copper/gold concentrate that is sold to smelters for further treatment and refining.

Copper Uses.

Refined copper is incorporated into wire and cable products for use in the construction, electric utility,
communications and transportation industries. Copper is also used in industrial equipment and machinery, consumer products and a variety of other electrical and electronic applications, and is also used to make brass. Copper substitutes include
aluminum, plastics, stainless steel and fiber optics. Refined, or cathode, copper is also an internationally traded commodity.

Copper
Supply.

The supply of copper consists of a combination of production from mining and recycled scrap material. Copper supply has not kept pace with increasing demand in recent years, resulting in price increases reflected
in the chart below.

Copper Price.

The price of copper is quoted on the London Metal Exchange in terms of
dollars per metric ton of high grade copper. The following table presents the dollar per pound equivalent of the high, low and average prices of high grade copper on the London Metal Exchange over the past ten years.

Source: London Metal
Exchange

On February 12, 2007, the closing price of high grade copper was $2.46 per pound on the London Metal Exchange. Our ability
to sell copper at market prices is limited in some cases by hedging activities, more particularly described in Note 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Hedging Activities

Newmont generally avoids gold hedging. Our philosophy is to provide shareholders with
leverage to changes in the gold price by selling our gold production at market prices. We have, however, entered into derivative contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated gold and copper production and to manage risks associated
with commodities, interest rates and foreign currencies.

For additional information, see Hedging in Item 7A, Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Merchant Banking

Merchant Banking, also referred to as Newmont Capital, manages a royalty portfolio, an equity
portfolio, a downstream gold refining business, and engages in portfolio management activities (managing interests in oil and gas, iron ore and coal properties as well as providing in-house investment banking and advisory services).



Newmont’s royalty portfolio generally offers a natural hedge against lower gold prices by providing
free cash flow from assets with limited operating, capital or environmental risk, while retaining upside exposure to further exploration discoveries and reserve expansions. Merchant Banking seeks to grow the royalty portfolio in a number of ways,
and looks for opportunities to acquire existing royalties from third parties or to create them in connection with transactions. Merchant Banking also identifies current properties or exploration targets for sale if they are non-core in nature. In
the case of a sale, Merchant Banking often seeks to retain royalty or other future participation rights in addition to cash or other consideration received.

In 2006, our royalty and equity portfolios generated $120 in

Royalty and dividend income, net

. We have royalty interests in Barrick Gold Corporation’s (“Barrick”) Goldstrike, Eskay Creek, Henty
and Bald Mountain mines and Stillwater Mining’s Stillwater and East Boulder palladium-platinum mines, among others. We also have a significant oil and gas royalty portfolio in western Canada.

As of December 31, 2006, Merchant Banking’s equity portfolio had a market value of approximately $1,354. The equity portfolio is primarily
composed of our investments in Canadian Oil Sands Trust, Shore Gold, Inc., Miramar Mining Corporation and Gabriel Resources, Ltd.

Merchant
Banking also manages our interests in downstream gold refining and distribution businesses (40% interest in AGR Matthey Joint Venture (“AGR”) and 50% interest in European Gold Refineries (“EGR”)). Merchant Banking earned $4 in

Equity income of affiliates

through its investments in AGR and EGR in 2006.

Merchant Banking’s portfolio management activities
include managing our interests in coal, iron ore, oil and natural gas.

Merchant Banking provides advisory services to assist in managing
the portfolio of operating and property interests. The Merchant Banking group helps maximize net asset value per share and increase cash flow, earnings and reserves by working with the exploration, operations and finance teams to prioritize
near-term goals within longer-term strategies. Merchant Banking is engaged in developing value optimization strategies for operating and non-operating assets, business development activities, potential merger and acquisition analysis and
negotiations, monetizing inactive exploration properties, capitalizing on proprietary technology and know-how and acting as an internal resource for other corporate groups to improve and maximize business outcomes. In 2006, Merchant Banking sold the
Company’s Alberta Oil Sands and Martabe and Holloway gold projects, and purchased additional interests in the Boddington and Akyem projects, as well as a new interest in Shore Gold Inc.’s Fort a la Corne Joint Venture, a diamond project in
Saskatchewan, Canada.

Merchant Banking continues to evaluate district optimization opportunities in Nevada, Australia, Peru, Indonesia,
Africa and Canada, covering a broad range of alternatives, including asset exchanges, unitization, joint ventures, partnerships, sales, spinouts and buyouts.

Exploration

Newmont’s exploration group is responsible for all activities, regardless of location,
associated with the Company’s efforts to discover new mineralized material and, if successful, advance such mineralized material into proven and probable reserves. Exploration is conducted in areas surrounding our existing mines for the purpose
of locating additional deposits and determining mine geology, and in other prospective gold regions globally. Near-mine exploration can result in the discovery of new gold mineralization, which will receive the economic benefit of existing
operating, processing, and administrative infrastructures. Greenfields exploration is where a discovery of new gold mineralization would likely require the investment of new capital to build a separate, stand-alone operation away from any of the
Company’s existing infrastructure. Our exploration teams employ state-of-the-art technology, including airborne geophysical data acquisition systems, satellite location devices and field-portable imaging systems, as well as geochemical and
geological prospecting methods, to identify prospective targets. We spent $170 in 2006, $147 in 2005 and $107 in 2004 on

Exploration

.



As of December 31, 2006, we had proven and probable gold reserves of 93.9 million equity
ounces. We added 5.9 million equity ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 8.9 million equity ounces of depletion and divestitures and 3.7 million equity ounces of acquisitions during 2006. A reconciliation of the changes in
proven and probable reserves during the past three years is as follows:

The impact of the change in gold price assumption on reserve additions was 3.1, 2.6 and 3.8 million
equity ounces in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

(3)

In 2004, Yanacocha reassessed the challenges involved in obtaining required permits for Cerro Quilish,
primarily related to increased community concerns. Based upon this reassessment, Yanacocha reclassified 3.9 million ounces (2.0 million equity ounces) from proven and probable reserves to mineralized material not in reserve as of
December 31, 2004.

(4)

In August 2006, the government of Uzbekistan appropriated the Company’s 50% interest in the
Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture.

In Nevada, exploration efforts during 2006 added 2.8 million equity ounces to
proven and probable reserves, offset by depletion of 3.0 million equity ounces, resulting in total proven and probable reserves of 33.1 million equity ounces as of December 31, 2006.

In Peru, equity gold reserves decreased to 15.1 million ounces, after depletion of 1.9 million ounces.

In Australia/New Zealand, the Company increased reserves to 18.5 million equity ounces after depletion of 1.5 million equity ounces during
2006. Reserves increased by 2.6 million equity ounces from the acquisition of an additional 22.22% interest in the Boddington project and 2.5 million equity ounces of additions from various sites.

At Batu Hijau, the Company depleted 0.2 billion equity pounds of copper and 0.3 million equity ounces of gold during 2006. Batu Hijau had proven and
probable reserves of 4.7 billion equity pounds of copper and 5.0 million equity ounces of gold as of December 31, 2006, after revisions downward of 1.1 billion equity pounds of copper and 1.3 million equity ounces of gold due to a new
mine plan incorporating higher costs, lower throughput and new geotechnical assumptions.

At Ahafo in Ghana, proven and probable reserves
increased by 0.7 million equity ounces from additions and at Akyem in Ghana, reserves increased 1.1 million equity ounces from the acquisition of the remaining 15% interest. As of December 31, 2006, the Company reported reserves of
12.6 million ounces at Ahafo and 7.7 million equity ounces at Akyem.

For additional information, see Item 2, Properties,
Proven and Probable Reserves.



Licenses and Concessions

Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities, there are no
third party patents, licenses or franchises material to our business. In many countries, however, we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to concessions granted by, or under contract with, the host government. These countries
include, among others, Australia, Bolivia, Canada, Ghana, Indonesia, Peru, New Zealand and Mexico. The concessions and contracts are subject to the political risks associated with foreign operations. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, Risks Related to
Newmont Operations, below. For a more detailed description of our Indonesian Contract of Work, see Item 2, Properties, below.

Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance

Our business is capital intensive, requiring ongoing capital
investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and facilities. For more information, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and
Capital Resources, below.

We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against risks that are
typical in the operation of our business, in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to environmental liability and political risk. There can be no
assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, Risks Related to Newmont Operations, below.

Environmental Matters

Newmont’s United States mining and exploration activities are subject to various
federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and Community
Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Federal Land Policy and Management Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and related state laws. These laws and regulations are continually changing
and are generally becoming more restrictive. Our activities outside the United States are also subject to governmental regulations for the protection of the environment.

We conduct our operations so as to protect public health and the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Each operating mine has a
reclamation plan in place that meets all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. We have made estimates of the amount of such expenditures,
but cannot precisely predict the amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2006, $520 was accrued for reclamation costs relating to
currently developed and producing properties.

We are also involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with
former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites. We believe that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in
nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the activities required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $85 was accrued as of
December 31, 2006 for such obligations associated with properties previously owned or operated by us or our subsidiaries. These amounts are included in

Other current liabilities

and

Reclamation and remediation liabilities.

Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, we believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 89% greater or 27% lower than the amount accrued as of December 31, 2006. The
amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are charged to costs and expenses in the period when estimates are revised.



For a discussion of the most significant reclamation and remediation activities, see Item 7,
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Notes 23 and 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, below.

Employees

There were approximately 15,000 people employed by Newmont as of December 31, 2006.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Every investor or potential investor in Newmont should carefully consider the following risks, which have been separated into two groups:

•

Risks related to the mining industry generally; and

•

Risks related to Newmont.

Risks Related to the Mining Industry Generally

A Substantial or Extended Decline in Gold or Copper
Prices Would Have a Material Adverse Effect on Newmont

Newmont’s business is dependent on the realized price of gold and
copper, which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors tending to put downward pressure on prices include:

•

Sales or leasing of gold by governments and central banks;

•

U.S. dollar strength;

•

Recession or reduced economic activity;

•

Speculative selling;

•

Decreased industrial, jewelry or investment demand;

•

Increased supply from production, disinvestment and scrap;

•

Sales by producers in forward and other hedging transactions; and

•

Devaluing local currencies (relative to gold and copper priced in U.S. dollars) leading to lower production costs and higher production in certain regions.



Any drop in the realized price of gold or copper adversely impacts our revenues, net income and cash
flows, particularly in light of our philosophy of generally avoiding gold hedging. We have recorded asset write-downs during periods of low gold prices in the past and may experience additional impairments as a result of low gold or copper prices in
the future.

In addition, sustained low gold or copper prices can:

•

Reduce revenues further through production declines due to cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits, that have become uneconomic at the
then-prevailing gold or copper price;

•

Reduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from long-term ore stockpiles;

•

Halt or delay the development of new projects;

•

Reduce funds available for exploration, with the result that depleted reserves may not be replaced; and

•

Reduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices.

Also see the discussion in Item 1, Business, Gold or Copper Price.

Gold and Copper Producers Must Continually Replace Reserves Depleted By Production

Gold and
copper producers must continually replace reserves depleted by production. Depleted reserves must be replaced by expanding known ore bodies or by locating new deposits in order for producers to maintain production levels over the long term.
Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and frequently is unproductive. No assurances can be given that any of our new or ongoing exploration programs will result in new mineral producing operations. Once mineralization is
discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until production is possible, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change.

Estimates of Proven and Probable Reserves Are Uncertain

Estimates of proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, to a large extent, based on interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration
techniques. Producers use feasibility studies to derive estimates of capital and operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of
metals from the ore, the costs of comparable facilities, the costs of operating and processing equipment and other factors. Actual operating costs and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from original estimates. Further, it may
take many years from the initial phase of exploration before production is possible and, during that time, the economic feasibility of exploiting a discovery may change.

Increased Costs Could Affect Profitability

Costs at any particular mining location frequently
are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body. In addition, costs are affected by the price of
commodities, such as fuel, electricity and labor. Commodity costs are at times subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. Reported costs may also be affected by changes
in accounting standards. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on Newmont’s profitability and cash flow.

The Company anticipates significant capital expenditures over the next several years in connection with the development of new projects and sustaining existing operations. Costs associated with capital expenditures
have escalated on an industry-wide basis over the last several years, as a result of major factors beyond the control of



the Company, including the prices of oil, steel and other commodities. Increased costs for capital expenditures have an adverse effect on the profitability
of existing mining operations and returns anticipated from new mining projects.

Shortages of Critical Parts, Equipment and Skilled
Labor May Adversely Affect Our Operations and Development Projects.

The industry has been impacted by increased worldwide demand
for critical resources such as input commodities, drilling equipment, tires and skilled labor. These shortages have caused unanticipated cost increases and delays in delivery times, thereby impacting operating costs, capital expenditures and
production schedules.

Mining Accidents or Other Adverse Events or Conditions at a Mining Location Could Reduce Our Production Levels

At any of Newmont’s operations, production may fall below historic or estimated levels as a result of mining accidents such as
a pit wall failure in an open pit mine, or cave-ins or flooding at underground mines. In addition, production may be unexpectedly reduced at a location if, during the course of mining, unfavorable ground conditions or seismic activity are
encountered; ore grades are lower than expected; the physical or metallurgical characteristics of the ore are less amenable to mining or treatment than expected; or our equipment, processes or facilities fail to operate properly or as expected.

Mining Companies Are Subject to Extensive Environmental Laws and Regulations

Newmont’s exploration, mining and processing operations are regulated in all countries in which we operate under various federal, state, provincial
and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, which generally include air and water quality, hazardous waste management and reclamation. Delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, government permits and approvals may adversely impact
our operations. The regulatory environment in which Newmont operates could change in ways that would substantially increase costs to achieve compliance, or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on Newmont’s operations or financial
position. For a more detailed discussion of potential environmental liabilities, see the discussion in Environmental Matters, Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Risks Related to Newmont

Import and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold;

•

Restrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore;

•

Risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;

•

Risk of loss due to disease and other potential endemic health issues; and

•

Other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, including risks inherent in contracts with government owned
entities.

Consequently, Newmont’s exploration, development and production activities outside of North America and
Australia/New Zealand may be substantially affected by factors beyond Newmont’s control, any of which could materially adversely affect Newmont’s financial position or results of operations. Furthermore, if a dispute arises from such
activities, Newmont may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts outside North America or Australia, which could adversely affect the outcome of a dispute.

Newmont has substantial investments in Indonesia, a nation that since 1997 has undergone financial crises and devaluation of its currency, outbreaks of political and religious violence, changes in national leadership,
and the secession of East Timor, one of its former provinces. These factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors, which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts,
increased taxation, denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets. During 2006, the government purported to designate the land surrounding Batu Hijau as a protected forest, which could make operating permits more difficult to
obtain. Newmont’s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of these actions occur.

In July 2004, a criminal complaint was filed against PT Newmont Minahasa Raya (“PTNMR”), the Newmont subsidiary that operated the Minahasa mine in Indonesia, alleging environmental pollution relating to submarine tailings
placement into nearby Buyat Bay. The Indonesian police detained five PTNMR employees during September and October of 2004. The police investigation and the detention of PTNMR’s employees was declared illegal by the South Jakarta District Court
in December 2004, but in March 2005, the Indonesian Supreme Court upheld the legality of the police investigation, and the police turned their evidence over to the local prosecutor. In July 2005, the prosecutor filed an indictment against PTNMR and
its President Director, alleging environmental pollution at Buyat Bay. After the court rejected motions to dismiss the proceeding, the trial proceeded and all evidence, including that of the defense, was presented in court as of September 2006. In
November 2006 the prosecution filed its charge, seeking a three-year jail sentence for PTNMR’s President Director plus a nominal fine. In addition, the prosecution has recommended a nominal fine against PTNMR. The defense filed responses in
January 2007 and after final briefing a verdict is expected in the second quarter of 2007.

Independent sampling and testing of Buyat Bay
water and fish, as well as area residents, conducted by the World Health Organization and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, confirm that PTNMR has not polluted the Buyat Bay environment, and, therefore, has
not adversely affected the fish in Buyat Bay or the health of nearby residents. PTNMR remains steadfast that it has not caused pollution or health problems and will continue to vigorously defend itself against these allegations. However, Newmont
cannot predict the outcome of the criminal proceeding or whether additional legal actions may occur. This matter could adversely affect our ability to operate in Indonesia.

On March 9, 2005, the Indonesian Ministry of the Environment filed a civil lawsuit against PTNMR and its President Director in relation to these
allegations, seeking in excess of $100 in monetary damages. In October 2005, PTNMR filed an objection to the court’s jurisdiction, contending that the Government previously agreed to resolve any disputes through out-of-court conciliation or
arbitration. The Court upheld PTNMR’s objection and dismissed the case in November 2005. The Government filed a notice of appeal of this ruling. On February 16, 2006, PTNMR and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia signed an
agreement settling the civil lawsuit. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government and PTNMR will nominate members to an independent



scientific panel that will develop and implement a ten-year environmental monitoring and assessment program to make a definitive, scientific conclusion
regarding the condition of Buyat Bay. PTNMR is required to fund specific remedial measures if, as a result of its mining operations, pollution has occurred. The agreement also provides for enhanced community development programs in North Sulawesi.
PTNMR will provide initial funding of $12 to cover the cost of the monitoring and community development programs. Over a ten year period, PTNMR will contribute an additional $18. The funds will be managed by an organization governed by interested
stakeholders. Accountability for the funds will be ensured through yearly reports that will be made available to the public. The transparency of the scientific panel’s activities will also be assured through annual reports to the public.
Pursuant to the agreement, the civil lawsuit against PTNMR was been terminated. The scientific panel held its first meeting in February 2007.

During the last several years, Yanacocha, in which Newmont owns a 51.35% interest, has been the target of numerous local political protests, including ones that blocked the road between the Yanacocha mine complex and the City of Cajamarca
in Peru. In 2004, local opposition to the Cerro Quilish project became so pronounced that Yanacocha decided to relinquish its drilling permit for Cerro Quilish and the deposit was reclassified from proven and probable reserves to non-reserve
mineralization. In 2005, no material roadblocks or protests occurred involving Yanacocha. However, in 2006 a road blockade was carried out by members of the Combayo community. This blockade resulted in a brief cessation of mining activities. We
cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur in the future, and the recurrence of significant community opposition or protests could adversely affect Yanacocha’s assets and operations.

Presidential, congressional and regional elections took place in Peru in 2006, with the new national government taking office in July 2006. In December
2006, Yanacocha, along with other mining companies in Peru, entered into an agreement with the central government to contribute 3.75% of net profits to fund social development projects. Although the current government has generally taken positions
promoting private investment, we cannot predict future government positions on foreign investment, mining concessions, land tenure, environmental regulation or taxation. A change in government positions on these issues could adversely affect
Yanacocha’s assets and operations.

During 2005, relations between the Republic of Uzbekistan and the U.S. deteriorated significantly,
and in July 2005 the government of Uzbekistan evicted the U.S. military from its base at Karshi-Khanabad, south of Tashkent.

In June 2006,
an economic court in Uzbekistan ruled in favor of tax authorities and against the Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture (“ZNJV”), which is 50% owned by the Company, on two claims to collect approximately $48 in taxes other than income taxes. The
tax authorities argued that Decree 151, which protected ZNJV from changes in tax laws and provided other financial and operational benefits, became ineffective and that the taxes and penalties claimed were owed for the period 2002-2005. Decree 151
had been granted by the Republic of Uzbekistan in 1992 as an incentive for the Company’s investment in ZNJV. The benefits it provided, including the stability of the tax and legal regime in effect at that time, were guaranteed to remain in
effect for so long as ZNJV had ongoing operations.

On July 26, 2006, the Republic of Uzbekistan caused the seizure of gold, silver
and unfinished product belonging to ZNJV. On August 14, 2006, the Company received notice that the economic court had accepted the petition of an agency of the Republic of Uzbekistan to institute bankruptcy proceedings against ZNJV. Neither
ZNJV nor the Company received advance notice that the petition was filed or that a hearing would be held. The court ordered “supervisory measures” restricting normal operations, including the export of gold or repayment of loans, without
the approval of a court-appointed temporary administrator, who has been overseeing all operations of ZNJV.

At a September 19, 2006
meeting of the ZNJV creditor’s committee, which was principally composed of government representatives, the committee voted to liquidate ZNJV. On September 29, 2006, the economic court



concluded that ZNJV was insolvent and ordered ZNJV to be liquidated by December 29, 2006. At this hearing, representatives of ZNJV and the Company were
denied an opportunity to present the case against liquidation. The remaining assets of ZNJV are anticipated to be liquidated to pay the tax liabilities that have been imposed on ZNJV by the Republic of Uzbekistan, resulting in the effective transfer
to the Republic of Uzbekistan of the Company’s interest in ZNJV. The liquidation sale has been postponed two times, and is now scheduled for early March 2007. Despite the Company’s demands for compensation for the losses it has suffered,
the Republic of Uzbekistan has refused to provide such compensation. On October 31, 2006, the Company filed demands for arbitration against the Republic of Uzbekistan in two separate international venues on the basis that the Republic of
Uzbekistan repudiated its obligations to the Company under Decree 151, Uzbek and international law, and various agreements. The Company and the defendants are in the process of appointing arbitrators. As of September 30, 2006, the Company had
written off the book value of its ownership interest in ZNJV, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $101. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Recent violence committed by radical elements in Indonesia and other countries, and the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, may increase the risk that operations owned by U.S. companies will be the target
of violence. If any of Newmont’s operations were so targeted it could have an adverse effect on our business.

Our Success May
Depend on Our Social and Environmental Performance

Newmont’s ability to operate successfully in communities around the world
will likely depend on our ability to develop, operate and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the health and safety of our employees, the protection of the environment, and the creation of long-term economic and social opportunities in
the communities in which we operate. Newmont has implemented a management system designed to promote continuous improvement in health and safety, environmental performance and community relations. However, our ability to operate could be adversely
impacted by accidents or events detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the health and safety of our employees, the environment or the communities in which we operate.

Remediation Costs for Environmental Liabilities May Exceed the Provisions We Have Made

Newmont has conducted extensive remediation work at two inactive sites in the United States. At one of these sites, remediation requirements have not been
finally determined, and, therefore, the final cost cannot be determined. At a third site in the United States, an inactive uranium mine and mill formerly operated by a subsidiary of Newmont, remediation work at the mill is ongoing, but remediation
at the mine is subject to dispute and has not yet commenced. The environmental standards that may ultimately be imposed at this site remain uncertain and there is a risk that the costs of remediation may exceed the provision that has been made for
such remediation by a material amount. For a more detailed discussion of potential environmental liabilities, see the discussion in Environmental Matters, Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased, the amount of that
liability and additional cost will be recorded at that time and could materially reduce net income in that period.

The Use of
Hedging Instruments May Prevent Gains Being Realized from Subsequent Price Increases

Newmont does not intend to enter into material
new gold hedging positions and intends to continue to decrease gold hedge positions over time by opportunistically delivering gold into our outstanding hedge contracts, or by seeking to eliminate our hedge position when economically attractive.
Nonetheless, Newmont currently has gold hedging positions and may, from time-to-time, enter into hedge contracts for copper, other metals or commodities, interest rates or foreign currencies. If the gold or copper price rises above the price at
which future production has been committed under these hedge instruments, Newmont will have an opportunity loss. However, if the gold or copper price falls below that committed price, Newmont’s revenues will be protected to the extent of such
committed production. In addition, we may experience losses if a hedge counterparty defaults under a contract when the contract price exceeds the gold or copper price.



For a more detailed description of the Newmont hedge positions, see the discussion in Hedging in
Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Currency Fluctuations May Affect Costs

Currency fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur at our operations.
Gold is sold throughout the world based principally on the U.S. dollar price, but a portion of Newmont’s operating expenses are incurred in local currencies. The appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies against the U.S. dollar can increase
the costs of gold production in U.S. dollar terms at mines located outside the United States, making such mines less profitable. The foreign currencies that primarily impact Newmont’s Results of Operation are the Australian and Canadian
dollars.

During 2006, the Australian dollar weakened by an average of 1% and the Canadian dollar strengthened by an average of 7% against
the U.S. dollar. This decreased the U.S. dollar

Costs applicable to sales

in Australia by approximately $7 and in Canada by $nil from 2005 to 2006. For additional information, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, below. For a more detailed description of how currency exchange rates may affect costs, see discussion in Foreign
Currency in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Future Funding Requirements May Affect Our
Business

The construction of the Boddington project in Australia, the 200 megawatt coal-fired power plant in Nevada, and the gold
mill at Yanacocha in Peru, as well as potential future investments in the Akyem project in Ghana and the Conga project in Peru, will require significant funds for capital expenditures. At current gold and copper prices, new sources of capital will
be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold
and copper prices and our operational performance, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities,
invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends could be significantly constrained.

Our
Interest in the Batu Hijau Operation in Indonesia May Be Reduced Under the Contract of Work

Under the Contract of Work with the
Indonesian government, beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2010, a portion of each foreign shareholder’s equity interest in the Batu Hijau operation must be offered for sale to the Indonesian government or to Indonesian nationals. The
government of Indonesia must approve any sale. The price at which such interest must be offered for sale is the highest of the then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares would be accepted for listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or
the fair market value of such interest as a going concern. Pursuant to this provision of the Contract of Work, it is possible that the ownership interest of the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership in Batu Hijau could be reduced to 49% by the end of 2010. A
company owned by an Indonesian national currently owns a 20% interest in Batu Hijau, and the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership was required to offer a 3% interest for sale in 2006. An offer to sell a 3% interest was made to the government of Indonesia.
While the central government declined to participate, local governments in the area in which the mine is located have expressed interest in acquiring shares, as have various Indonesian nationals. The Newmont/Sumitomo partnership continues
discussions to meet its divestiture obligations. Under the terms of the Contract of Work, an additional 7% interest in Batu Hijau must be offered for sale in 2007.



Costs Estimates and Timing of New Projects Are Uncertain

The capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable and changes in costs or construction schedules can
affect project economics. There are a number of factors that can affect costs and construction schedules, including, among others:

•

Availability of labor, power, transportation, commodities and infrastructure;

•

Increases in input commodity prices and labor costs;

•

Fluctuations in exchange rates;

•

Availability of financing;

•

Difficulty of estimating construction costs over a period of years; and

•

Delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits.

Our Operations May Be Adversely Affected By Power Shortages.

We have experienced power
shortages in Ghana resulting from a nationwide drought and lack of hydroelectric generating capacity. Power shortages have caused curtailment of production at our Ahafo operations. Alternative sources of power will result in higher than anticipated
costs, which will affect operating costs. Continued power shortages and increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Occurrence of Events for Which We Are Not Insured May Affect Our Cash Flow and Overall Profitability

We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against certain risks related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable depending upon the circumstances surrounding each identified risk. However,
Newmont may elect not to have insurance for certain risks because of the high premiums associated with insuring those risks or for various other reasons; in other cases, insurance may not be available for certain risks. Some concern always exists
with respect to investments in parts of the world where civil unrest, war, nationalist movements, political violence or economic crisis are possible. These countries may also pose heightened risks of expropriation of assets, business interruption,
increased taxation and a unilateral modification of concessions and contracts. Newmont does not maintain insurance policies against political risk. Occurrence of events for which Newmont is not insured may affect our cash flow and overall
profitability.

Our Business Depends on Good Relations with Our Employees

Newmont could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect us. As of December 31, 2006,
unions represented approximately 38% of our worldwide work force. On that date, Newmont had 3,040 employees in Indonesia at its Batu Hijau operation, 1,364 employees at its Carlin, Nevada operations, 601 employees in Peru at its Yanacocha operation,
412 employees in Bolivia at its Kori Kollo operation, 150 employees at its Australia operations and 27 employees in New Zealand at its Martha operations working under collective bargaining agreements or similar labor agreements. Currently, there are
labor agreements in effect for all of these workers. The labor agreement for Peru expires February 28, 2007, and is currently being re-negotiated. There can be no assurance that future disputes will be resolved without disruptions to operations.

Title to Some of Our Properties May Be Defective or Challenged

Although we have conducted title reviews of our properties, title review does not necessarily preclude third parties from challenging our title. While we
believe that we have satisfactory title to our properties, some risk exists that some titles may be defective or subject to challenge. In addition, certain of our Australian properties



could be subject to native title or traditional landowner claims, but such claims would not deprive us of the properties. For information regarding native
title or traditional landowner claims, see the discussion under the Australia/New Zealand section of Item 2, Properties, below.

We Compete With Other Mining Companies

We compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives,
skilled labor and other employees with technical skills and experience in the mining industry. We also compete with other mining companies for rights to mine properties containing gold and other minerals. There can be no assurance that Newmont will
continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties.

Certain
Factors Outside of Our Control May Affect Our Ability to Support the Carrying Value of Goodwill

As of December 31, 2006, the
carrying value of goodwill was approximately $3,004 or 19% of our total assets. Goodwill has been assigned to our Merchant Banking ($1,661) and Exploration ($1,129) Segments, and to various mine site reporting units in the Australia/New Zealand
Segment ($214). This goodwill primarily arose in connection with our February 2002 acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada, and it represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of
Normandy and Franco-Nevada. We evaluate, on at least an annual basis, the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether current events and circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may no longer be recoverable. This evaluation involves a
comparison of the estimated fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values.

Based on valuations of the Merchant Banking and
Exploration Segments, the Company concluded that the estimated fair values significantly exceeded the respective carrying values as of December 31, 2006. The fair values of the Merchant Banking and Exploration Segments are based, in part, on
certain factors that may be partially or completely outside of our control, such as the investing environment, the legal and regulatory and political environments in countries where we operate and explore, the successful discovery, development and
production of proven and probable reserves, commodity and labor prices, and other factors. In addition, certain of the assumptions underlying the December 31, 2006 Merchant Banking and Exploration Segments valuations may not be easily achieved
by the Company.

The Exploration Segment’s valuation model attributes all cash flows expected to be derived from future exploration
discoveries, whether near-mine or greenfield, to the Exploration Segment. Therefore, the valuation model includes all expected value from future discoveries, including existing and future mine site reporting units. Existing proven and probable
reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair
value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The value beyond proven and probable reserves (which uses the same valuation concepts as required by EITF 04-03,

Mining Assets:
Impairment and Business Combinations

) relating to mine site reporting units is excluded when determining the fair value of the Exploration Segment, if any, at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The
valuation model includes management’s best estimates of future reserve additions from exploration activities and all revenues and costs associated with their discovery, development and production. Historical proven and probable reserve
additions, excluding acquisitions, are used as an indicator of the Exploration Segment’s ability to discover additional reserves in the future. Actual reserve additions may vary significantly from year to year due to the time required to
advance a deposit from initial discovery to proven and probable reserves and based on the timing of when proven and probable reserves can be reported under the Securities and Exchange Commission Industry Guide 7. The valuation model assumes that the
Company will be able to perpetually develop and produce the assumed additions to proven and probable reserves from future discoveries at existing or new mine site reporting units. These estimates assume that the Company will continue to find
reserves of sufficient size and



quality to meet the Company’s operational and return thresholds in increasing quantities in perpetuity. Future discoveries could become increasingly
difficult to locate, and even if the Company finds reserves in a sufficient quality and size, they may consist of a larger number of smaller deposits that could be more costly to develop and/or operate than historically experienced. The development
and production of reserves will eventually lead to the depletion of existing mine site reporting units and require the perpetual development of new mines in increasing quantities through successful greenfield exploration. A reduction in reserves or
a lower than expected increase in reserve additions, or a greater than expected increase in operating or capital costs, may negatively impact the value of the Exploration Segment and may result in the impairment of the Exploration Segment’s
goodwill. Based on the period required to advance projects from initial discovery to production, the valuation model has negative net cash flows for approximately the first 10 years and more than 100% of the fair value of the Exploration Segment is
attributable to its terminal value.

Subsequent to the business combinations for which value beyond proven and probable reserves were
recorded, EITF 04-03,

Mining Assets: Impairment and Business Combinations,

was issued and requires that value beyond proven and probable reserves be allocated to mining assets. The Company defined value beyond proven and probable reserves as
the value of known mineralization other than proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base that is measured based on extrapolation of known exploration information, to the
extent that it believes a market participant would include such value in determining the fair value of the assets. The Company’s interpretation of value beyond proven and probable reserves may differ from that of other mining industry companies
and may result in a different allocation of values at the time of acquisition and subsequent impairment analysis. If value beyond proven and probable reserves was interpreted to include value in excess of the Company’s determination, such
values would be considered tangible mineral interests and therefore reduce the implied fair value of goodwill. Under such an interpretation, if the carrying value of the Exploration Segment exceeds its estimated fair value (Step 1), the Company
would compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount and write-off any excess carrying amount over the implied fair value (Step 2) resulting in an impairment loss in the financial statements. The Company has not been required to
perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test for the Exploration Segment. Please see the Company’s Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional details.

The Company’s approach to managing the exploration aspect of its business separate from the day to day operations of its mine site reporting units
may differ from the approach taken by other companies in the mining industry. Other mining companies may integrate the exploration function with their mine site reporting units, allocating residual goodwill to these units. Absent our Exploration
Segment’s success and reporting structure, we may have reached a similar conclusion regarding the goodwill allocation. As a result of these potential differences, the Company’s financial position and results of operations may not be
comparable to those of other entities in the mining industry.

Based on valuations of various mine site reporting units in the
Australia/New Zealand Segment, the Company concluded that the estimated fair values exceeded the respective carrying values as of December 31, 2006. The Company concluded that the estimated fair value of the Nevada Segment did not support the
carrying value as of December 31, 2005 and recorded a $41 goodwill impairment charge. The impairment resulted from a reevaluation of life of mine plans that indicated higher future operating and capital costs. In 2004, the Company recorded
goodwill and long-lived assets impairment charges of $52 and $6, respectively, relating to the Pajingo reporting unit in the Australia/New Zealand Segment. The Company’s fair value estimates are based on numerous assumptions and it is possible
that actual fair value could be significantly different than these estimates, as future quantities of recoverable minerals, gold and other commodity prices, production levels, operating costs and capital costs are each subject to significant risks
and uncertainties.

In the absence of any mitigating valuation factors, the Company’s failure to achieve one or more of the
December 31, 2006 valuation assumptions may over time result in an impairment charge. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that significant non-cash impairment charges will not be recorded in the future due to possible declines in the fair
values of our reporting units. For a more detailed description of the estimates and



assumptions involved in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Policies, below.

Our Ability to Recognize the
Benefits of Deferred Tax Assets is Dependent on Future Cash Flows and Taxable Income

The Company recognizes the expected future tax
benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires
management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the
extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit the Company’s ability to
obtain the future tax benefits represented by its deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2006, the Company’s current and long-term deferred tax assets were $156 and $799, respectively.

Returns for Investments in Pension Plans Are Uncertain

We maintain pension plans for employees, which provide for specified payments after retirement for certain employees. The ability of the pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our funding of the
plans and returns on investments made by the plans. Returns, if any, on investments are subject to fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions. A sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could require us to fund
the pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Gold and Copper Processing Methods

Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either heap leaching or
milling, depending on the amount of gold contained in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related capital and operating costs. Higher grade oxide ores are generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into a fine powder
and mixed with water in slurry, which then passes through a carbon-in-leach circuit. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or run-of-mine ore on impermeable pads, where a weak
cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. In both cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected and pumped to process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or by zinc precipitation.

Gold contained in ores that are not naturally oxidized can be directly milled if the gold is amenable to cyanidization, generally known as free
milling sulfide ores. Ores that are not amenable to cyanidization, known as refractory ores, require more costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free milling ore. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through either roasters or
autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores.

Some sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant or by bio-milling. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into slurry, then placed in a
tank known as a flotation cell. Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing sulfides to float attached to air bubbles to the top of the tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into a concentrate that can then be
processed in an autoclave or roaster to recover the gold. Bio-milling incorporates patented technology that involves inoculation of suitable crushed ore on a leach pad with naturally occurring bacteria strains, which oxidize the sulfides over a
period of time. The ore is then processed through an oxide mill.



At Batu Hijau, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then
transported from the mine via conveyor to a concentrator, where it is finely ground and then treated by successive stages of flotation, resulting in a concentrate containing approximately 30% copper. The concentrate is dewatered and stored for
loading onto ships for transport to smelters.

Production Properties

Set forth below is a description of Newmont’s significant production properties.

Costs applicable to sales

for each operation are presented in a table in the next section of Item 2.

Nevada

Newmont has been mining gold in Nevada since 1965. Nevada operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the
geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles north of Golconda, the Lone Tree Complex near the town of Valmy, and the Midas mine near the town of the same name. Newmont also participates in the
Turquoise Ridge joint venture with Barrick, which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks. The Phoenix gold/copper project, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, commenced commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2006. The Leeville
underground mine, located on the Carlin Trend northwest of the Carlin East underground mine, also commenced commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Gold sales from Nevada totaled approximately 2.5 million ounces (2.4 million equity ounces) for 2006 with ore mined from nine open pit and five underground mines. At year-end 2006, Newmont reported
33.1 million equity ounces of gold reserves in Nevada, with 85% in open pit mines and 15% in underground mines. Refractory ores require more complex, higher cost processing methods. Refractory ore treatment facilities generated 72% of
Nevada’s gold production in 2006, compared with 69% in 2005, and 68% in 2004. With respect to remaining reserves, we estimate that 77% are refractory ores and 23% are oxide ores.



The Nevada operations produce gold from a variety of ore types requiring different processing techniques
depending on economic and metallurgical characteristics. To ensure the best use of processing capacity, the Company uses a linear programming model to guide the flow of both mining sequence selection and routing of ore streams to various plants.
Higher-grade oxide ores are processed by conventional milling and cyanide leaching at Carlin (Mill 5), Twin Creeks (Juniper) and Lone Tree. Lower-grade material with suitable cyanide solubility is treated on heap leach pads at Carlin, Twin Creeks
and Lone Tree. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through either a roaster at Carlin (Mill 6) or autoclaves at Twin Creeks (Sage) and Lone Tree. Lower-grade refractory ores are processed by a flotation plant at Lone Tree or either
bio-oxidation/flotation or direct flotation at Mill 5. Ore from the Midas mine is processed by conventional milling and Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation. Activated carbon from the various leaching circuits is treated to produce gold ore at Carlin
and Twin Creeks. Zinc precipitate at Midas is refined on-site. Mining and the final placement of ore on the leach pads at Lone Tree was completed in the fourth quarter of 2006. Residual leaching will continue thereafter. Milling of stockpiled ore at
Lone Tree is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2007.

Newmont owns, or controls through long-term mining leases and
unpatented mining claims, all of the minerals and surface area within the boundaries of the present Nevada mining operations (except for the Turquoise Ridge joint venture described below). The long-term leases extend for at least the anticipated
mine life of those deposits. With respect to a significant portion of the Gold Quarry mine at Carlin, Newmont owns a 10% undivided interest in the mineral rights and leases the remaining 90%, on which Newmont pays a royalty equivalent to 18% of the
mineral production. The remainder of the Gold Quarry mineral rights are wholly-owned or controlled by Newmont, in some cases subject to additional royalties. With respect to certain smaller deposits in Western Nevada, Newmont is obligated to pay
royalties on production to third parties that vary from 2% to 5% of production.

Newmont has a 25% interest in a joint venture with a
subsidiary of Barrick to operate the Turquoise Ridge and Getchell mines. Newmont has an agreement to provide up to 2,000 tons per day of milling capacity at Twin Creeks to the joint venture. Barrick is the operator of the joint venture for mining
and ore delivery to process. Gold sales of 58,300 ounces were attributed to Newmont in 2006, based on its 25% ownership interest.

Newmont
has ore sale agreements with Barrick and Queenstake Resources, Ltd. to process some of the Company’s ore. Newmont recognized attributable gold sales, net of treatment charges, of 99,500 ounces in 2006 and 104,600 ounces in 2005 pursuant to
these agreements.

Newmont has sales and refining agreements with Gerald Metals, Peñoles, Queenstake, Johnson Matthey and Just
Refiners to process intermediate gold bearing product.

Yanacocha, Peru

The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) are located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48
kilometers) north of the city of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993. Newmont holds a 51.35% interest in Yanacocha with the remaining interests held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. (43.65%) and the
International Finance Corporation (5%).

Yanacocha has mining rights with respect to a large land position. Yanacocha’s mining rights
consist of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to Yanacocha and a related entity. These mining concessions provide for both the right to explore and exploit. However, Yanacocha must first obtain the respective exploration and exploitation
permits, which are generally granted in due course. Yanacocha may retain mining concessions indefinitely by paying annual fees and, during exploitation, complying with production obligations or paying assessed fines. Mining concessions are freely
assignable or transferable.

Yanacocha currently has two active open pit mines, Cerro Yanacocha and La Quinua. In addition, reclamation
and/or backfilling activities at Carachugo, San José and Maqui Maqui are currently underway. In



addition, Yanacocha has four leach pads and three processing facilities. Yanacocha’s gold sales for 2006 totaled 2.6 million ounces (1.3 million
equity ounces).

The Yanacocha operations contain the Conga deposit, for which a feasibility study was completed in 2004. The Company
continues to evaluate the optimum development plan for Conga, and currently anticipates that production would not commence until after 2010.

Yanacocha, along with other mining companies in Peru, has agreed with the central government to contribute 3.75% of its net profits to fund social development projects.

Australia/New Zealand

In
Australia, mineral exploration and mining titles are granted by the individual states or territories. Mineral titles may also be subject to native title legislation or, in the Northern Territory, to Aboriginal freehold title legislation that
entitles indigenous persons to compensation calculated by reference to the gross value of production. In 1992, the High Court of Australia held that Aboriginal people who have maintained a continuing connection with their land according to their
traditions and customs may hold certain rights in respect of the land, such rights commonly referred to as native title. Since the High Court’s decision, Australia has passed legislation providing for the protection of native title and
established procedures for Aboriginal people to claim these rights. The fact that native title is claimed with respect to an area, however, does not necessarily mean that native title exists, and disputes may be resolved by the courts.

Generally, under native title legislation, all mining titles granted before January 1, 1994 are valid. Titles granted between January 1,
1994 and December 23, 1996, however, may be subject to invalidation if they were not obtained in compliance with applicable legislative procedures, though subsequent legislation has validated some of these titles. After December 23, 1996,
mining titles over areas where native title is claimed to exist became subject to legislative processes that generally give native title claimants the “right to negotiate” with the title applicant for compensation and other conditions.
Native title holders do not have a veto over the granting of mining titles, but if agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be referred to the National Native Title Tribunal for decision.

Newmont does not expect that native title claims will have a material adverse effect on any of its operations in Australia. The High Court of Australia
determined in an August 2002 decision, which refined and narrowed the scope of native title, that native title does not subsist in minerals in Western Australia and that the rights granted under a mining title would, to the extent inconsistent with
asserted native title rights, operate to extinguish those native title rights. Generally, native title is only an issue for Newmont with respect to obtaining new mineral titles or moving from one form of title to another, for example, from an
exploration title to a mining title. In these cases, the requirements for negotiation and the possibility of paying compensation may result in delay and increased costs for mining in the affected areas. Similarly, the process of conducting
Aboriginal heritage surveys to identify and locate areas or sites of Aboriginal cultural significance can result in additional costs and delay in gaining access to land for exploration and mining-related activities.

In Australia, various ad valorem royalties are paid to state and territorial governments, typically based on a percentage of gross revenues.

Pajingo.

Pajingo (100% owned) is an underground mine located approximately 93 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of
Townsville, Queensland and 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the local township of Charters Towers. In 2006, Pajingo sold 174,600 ounces of gold.

Jundee.

The Jundee operation (100% owned) is situated approximately 435 miles (700 kilometers) northeast of Perth in Western Australia. Jundee sold 305,400 ounces of gold in 2006.



Tanami.

The Tanami operations (100% owned) include The Granites treatment
plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead Bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25
miles (40 kilometers) west of The Granites. The Tanami operations have been wholly-owned since April 2003, when Newmont acquired the minority interests.

The operations are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak, with mill feed supplemented by production stockpiles from the Dead Bullock Soak open pit. Ore from all of these operations
is processed through The Granites plant. During 2006, the Tanami operations sold 417,600 ounces of gold.

Kalgoorlie.

The Kalgoorlie operations comprise the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit) and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth.
The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick, each of which holds a 50% interest. The Super Pit is Australia’s largest gold mine in terms of gold production and annual
mining volume. During 2006, the Kalgoorlie operations sold 332,200 equity ounces of gold.

Martha.

The Martha
operations (100% owned) are located within the town of Waihi, located approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand. During 2006, production commenced at the Favona underground deposit. Production at the Martha open pit
will cease in 2007. The operation sold 120,300 ounces of gold during 2006. The Martha mine does not currently pay royalties. Under new royalty arrangements, however, Newmont will pay 1% of gross revenues from gold and silver sales, or 5% of
accounting profit, whichever is greater, at Favona.

Boddington.

Boddington is a development project located
81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Perth in Western Australia. As of December 31, 2006 Boddington was owned by Newmont (66.67%) and AngloGold Ashanti Limited (33.33%). In March 2006, Newmont acquired Newcrest Mining Limited’s
22.22% interest in Boddington for $173.

Batu Hijau, Indonesia

Batu Hijau is located on the island of Sumbawa, approximately 950 miles (1,529 kilometers) east of Jakarta. Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold
deposit which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2006, copper sales were 434.7 million pounds (229.9 million equity pounds), while gold sales were 435,300
ounces (230,200 equity ounces).

Newmont operates Batu Hijau, a producer of copper/gold concentrates, and has a 45% ownership interest
therein, held through a partnership with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation. Newmont has a 56.25% interest in the partnership and the Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. The partnership, in turn, owns 80% of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara
(“PTNNT”), the subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. The remaining 20% interest in PTNNT is a carried interest held by P.T. Pukuafu Indah, an unrelated Indonesian company. Through September 30, 2004, PTNNT recorded cumulative losses and
therefore Newmont historically reported a 56.25% economic interest in Batu Hijau. As a result of higher metal prices, improved operating and financial results, and increased life of mine expectations regarding production, costs and economics,
PTNNT’s cumulative losses had been recovered by the fourth quarter of 2004, thereby allowing for the payment of dividends. Under existing shareholder agreements, the Indonesian shareholder will be entitled to receive 6% of any dividends paid by
PTNNT until such time as a loan to the Indonesian shareholder is fully repaid (including accrued interest). Newmont, therefore, decreased its economic interest in Batu Hijau to 52.875%, effective October 1, 2004, reflecting 56.25% of the 94% of
PTNNT’s dividends payable to the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership.

In Indonesia, rights are granted to foreign investors to explore for
and to develop mineral resources within defined areas through Contracts of Work entered into with the Indonesian government. In 1986, PTNNT entered



into a Contract of Work with the Indonesian government covering Batu Hijau, under which PTNNT was granted the exclusive right to explore in the contract
area, construct any required facilities, extract and process the mineralized materials, and sell and export the minerals produced, subject to certain requirements including Indonesian government approvals and payment of royalties to the government.
Under the Contract of Work, PTNNT has the right to continue operating the project for 30 years from operational start-up, or longer if approved by the Indonesian government.

Under the Contract of Work, beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2010, a portion of the project must be offered for sale to the Indonesian government
or to Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between the following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 23% by the end of 2006; 30% by the
end of 2007; 37% by the end of 2008, 44% by the end of 2009; and 51% by the end of 2010. The price at which such interest must be offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current replacement cost, the price at which
shares would be accepted for listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or the fair market value of such interest as a going concern. Pursuant to this provision, it is possible that the ownership interest of the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership in Batu
Hijau could be reduced to 49% by the end of 2010.

A company owned by an Indonesian national currently owns a 20% interest in Batu Hijau,
and therefore the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership was required to offer a 3% interest for sale in 2006. An offer to sell a 3% interest was made to the government of Indonesia. While the central government declined to participate, local governments in
the area in which the mine is located have expressed an interest in acquiring shares, as have various Indonesian nationals. An additional 7% interest in Batu Hijau must be offered for sale in 2007. The Newmont/Sumitomo partnership continues
discussions with various interested parties to meet its divestiture obligations.

Ghana

The Ahafo operation (100% owned) is located in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. Ahafo poured
its first gold on July 18, 2006 and commenced commercial production in August 2006. Ahafo sold 202,000 ounces of gold in 2006.

Newmont currently operates two open pits at Ahafo with total reserves contained in 15 pits. The process plant consists of a conventional mill and carbon-in-leach circuit. Ahafo reserves as of December 31, 2006, were 12.6 million
equity ounces.

In December 2003, Ghana’s Parliament unanimously ratified an
Investment Agreement between Newmont and the Government of Ghana. The Agreement establishes a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of any Newmont project in Ghana. Under the Agreement, Newmont will pay
corporate income tax at the Ghana statutory tax rate (presently 25%) not to exceed 32.5% and fixed gross royalties on gold production of 3.0% (3.6% for any production from forest reserve areas). The Government of Ghana is also entitled to receive
10% of a project’s net cash flow after Newmont has recouped its investment and may acquire up to 20% of a project’s equity at fair market value on or after the 15

th

anniversary of such project’s commencement of production. The Investment Agreement also contains commitments with respect to job training for local
Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local goods and services and environmental protection.

Newmont has one development project
in Ghana, currently the subject of further optimization studies. The Akyem project is approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. As of December 31, 2005, Newmont held an 85% interest in the Akyem project. The remaining 15% was
held by Kenbert Mines Limited. In January 2006, Newmont acquired the remaining 15% interest, bringing its ownership to 100% of the Akyem project. In the second half of 2006, the Company deferred further development of Akyem, pending completion of
permitting, resolution of country-wide power shortages and further engineering and optimization.



Other Operations

Canada.

During 2006, Newmont’s Canadian operations included two underground mines. Golden Giant (100% owned) is located
approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Marathon in Ontario, Canada, and has been in production since 1985. Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005 with remnant mining and milling production continuing throughout
most of 2006. In 2006, Golden Giant sold 59,300 ounces of gold. Holloway is located approximately 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Matheson in Ontario, and about 400 miles (644 kilometers) northeast of Golden Giant, and has been in production since
1996. In 2006, Holloway sold 26,000 ounces of gold. On November 6, 2006, Newmont completed the sale of the Holloway mine to St. Andrews Goldfields Ltd. resulting in a $13 pre-tax gain.

Mexico.

Newmont has a 44% interest in La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora desert. La Herradura is
operated by Industriales Peñoles (which owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises an open pit operation with run-of-mine heap leach processing. La Herradura sold 79,200 equity ounces of gold in 2006.

Bolivia.

The Kori Kollo open pit mine is on a high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining
concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A. (“Inti Raymi”), in which Newmont has an 88% interest. The remaining 12% is owned by Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado. Inti Raymi owns and operates the mine. The
mill was closed in October 2003 and production continued from residual leaching. In 2005, additional material from the stockpiles and Lla Llagua pit were placed on the existing leach pad and ore from the Kori Chaca pit was processed on a new leach
pad. In 2006, the mine sold 113,300 equity ounces of gold.

Minahasa, Indonesia.

Newmont owns 80% of Minahasa
and the remaining 20% interest is a carried interest held by P.T. Tanjung Serapung, an unrelated Indonesian company. Minahasa is located on the island of Sulawesi, approximately 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometers) northeast of Jakarta. Mining was
completed in late 2001 and gold production was completed in 2004. See Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Minahasa.



Operating Statistics

The following tables detail operating statistics related to gold production and sales.





The following table details operating statistics related to copper production and sales.

Proven and Probable Equity Reserves

Newmont had proven and probable equity gold reserves of 93.9 million
ounces as of December 31, 2006. Gold reserves were calculated at a $500, A$675 or NZ$750 per ounce gold price. Newmont’s 2006 reserves would decline by approximately 7%, or 6.7 million ounces, if calculated at a $475 per ounce gold
price. An increase in the gold price to $525 per ounce would increase reserves by approximately 5%, or 4.4 million ounces, all other assumptions remaining constant.

As of December 31, 2006, Newmont’s equity gold reserves in Nevada were 33.1 million ounces. Outside of Nevada, year-end equity gold reserves were 60.8 million ounces, including 18.5 million
ounces in Australia/New Zealand, 15.1 million ounces in Peru and 20.3 million ounces in Ghana.

Newmont’s equity copper
reserves as of December 31, 2006 were 8.0 billion pounds. Copper reserves were calculated at a price of $1.25 or A$1.70 per pound.

Under Newmont’s current mining plans, all reserves are located on fee property or mining claims or will be depleted during the terms of existing mining licenses or concessions, or where applicable, any assured renewal or extension
periods for the licenses or concessions.

Proven and probable equity reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and
metallurgical testing from which economic feasibility has been determined. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical
recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables below list the average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into account the several different
processing methods to be used. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralized material considered economic to process, varies with material type, metallurgical recoveries and operating costs.

The proven and probable equity reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can
be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold and copper will be realized. Ounces of gold or pounds of copper in the proven and probable reserves are calculated without regard to any losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates
may require revision based on actual production experience. Market price fluctuations of gold and copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render proven and probable reserves containing relatively
lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.

Reserves are published once each year
and will be recalculated as of December 31, 2007, taking into account metal prices, divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and additions to reserves during 2007.



The following tables detail gold proven and
probable equity reserves

(1)

reflecting only those reserves owned by Newmont on December 31, 2006 and 2005:



(1)

The term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or
produced at the time of the reserve determination.

The term “economically,” as used in the definition of
reserve, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in a full feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions.

The term “legally,” as used in the definition of reserve, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or
that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont must have a justifiable



expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a
particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Newmont’s current mine plans.

The
term “proven reserves” means reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and
(c) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.

The term “probable reserves” means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves,
but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.

Proven and probable equity reserves were calculated using different cut-off grades. The term “cut-off grade” means the lowest grade of
mineralized material that can be included in the reserves in a given deposit. Cut-off grades vary between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, amenability of the ore to gold extraction, and type of
milling or leaching facilities available.

2006 reserves were calculated at a $500, A$675 or NZ$750 per ounce gold price unless otherwise
noted.

2005 reserves were calculated at a $400, A$550 or NZ$650 per ounce gold price unless otherwise noted.

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASE OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Newmont’s common stock is listed and principally traded on the New York Stock Exchange (under the symbol “NEM”) and is also listed in the
form of CHESS Depositary Interests (“CDIs”) (under the symbol “NEM”) on the Australian Stock Exchange (“ASX”). In Australia, Newmont is referred to as “Newmont Mining Corporation ARBN 099 065 997 organized in
Delaware with limited liability.” Since July 1, 2002, Newmont CDIs have traded on the ASX as a Foreign Exempt Listing granted by the ASX, which provides an ancillary trading facility to Newmont’s primary listing on NYSE. Newmont
Mining Corporation of Canada Limited’s exchangeable shares (“Exchangeable Shares”) are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (under the symbol “NMC”). The Exchangeable Shares were issued in connection with the acquisition of
Franco-Nevada. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share of Newmont’s common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape.

On February 12, 2007, there were outstanding 423,519,644 shares of Newmont’s common
stock (including shares represented by CDIs), which were held by approximately 16,413 stockholders of record. A dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock outstanding was declared in each quarter of 2006 and 2005, for a total of $0.40 during each
year.

On February 12, 2007, there were outstanding 27,157,953 Exchangeable Shares, which were held by 48 holders of record. The
Exchangeable Shares are exchangeable at the option of the holders into Newmont common stock. Holders of Exchangeable Shares are therefore entitled to receive dividends equivalent to those that Newmont declares on its common stock.

The determination of the amount of future dividends will be made by Newmont’s Board of Directors from time to time and will depend on Newmont’s
future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other relevant factors.

Overview

Newmont is one of the world’s largest gold producers and is the only gold company included in
the S&P 500 Index. We are also engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold properties. We have operations in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Canada, Bolivia, New Zealand, Ghana and Mexico.

We face key risks associated with our business. One of the most significant risks is fluctuation in the prices of gold and copper, which are affected by
numerous factors beyond our control. Other challenges we face include capital and production cost increases and social and environmental issues. Operating costs at our operations are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as changing
ore grades, metallurgy, revisions to mine plans and changes in accounting principles. At foreign locations, such costs are also influenced by currency fluctuations that may affect our U.S. dollar operating costs. In addition, we must continually
replace reserves depleted through production by expanding known ore bodies, by acquisition or by locating new deposits in order to maintain production levels over the long term.



Summary of Consolidated Financial and Operating Performance

The table below highlights key financial and operating results:

(1)

Includes incremental start-up ounces of 100,300 and 22,100 in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

(2)

Before treatment and refining charges.

(3)

Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization.

Consolidated Financial Performance

Gold revenues increased in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to higher gold prices, partially offset by lower gold sales volume. Gold sold decreased to 7.4 million ounces in 2006 from 8.4 million ounces in 2005, primarily due to
decreased throughput and lower grade ores processed at Yanacocha, Nevada and Batu Hijau, decreased throughput at Australia/New Zealand partially offset by the commencement of operations at Ahafo in the third quarter of 2006. Copper revenues
decreased in 2006 from 2005 due to a decrease in copper pounds sold at Batu Hijau, partially offset by an increase in the average realized price (see Results of Consolidated Operations below).

The gold price increases over the last few years were partially offset by higher production costs and fewer gold ounces sold. During the same period,
Newmont has seen significant increases in the costs of labor, fuel, power and other bulk consumables.

In addition, our financial and
operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 were impacted by the following (pre-tax):

•

Gain on the sale of the Alberta Oil Sands project ($266 in 2006);

•

Increased income tax expense ($114 greater than 2005);

•

Loss on the expropriation of the Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture (“ZNJV”) ($101 in 2006);

•

Increased reclamation and remediation costs ($47 in 2006);

•

Loss on the early extinguishment of prepaid forward sales obligation ($40 in 2006);

•

Increased exploration expenditures ($23 greater than 2005); and

•

Increased advanced projects research and development expenditures ($21 greater than 2005).



Liquidity

The Company’s financial position was as follows:

During 2006 our debt and liquidity positions were affected by the following:

•

Net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $198;

•

Net cash provided from continuing operations of $1,237;

•

Proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of $40 and other assets of $334;

•

Scheduled debt repayments of $111 cash and $48 non-cash;

•

Early extinguishment of prepaid forward sales obligation of $48;

•

Capital expenditures at continuing operations of $1,551;

•

Dividends paid to common shareholders of $180; and

•

Dividends paid to minority interests of $264.

Looking Forward

Certain key factors will affect our future financial and operating results.
These include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

Fluctuations in gold prices and, to a lesser extent, copper prices;

•

Newmont expects 2007 consolidated gold sales of approximately 6.1 to 6.6 million ounces (approximately 5.2 to 5.6 million equity ounces), primarily as a
result of lower production from Yanacocha and Australia, as well as the closure of Lone Tree in Nevada and Golden Giant in Canada in 2006.

•

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce for 2007 are expected to be approximately 25% higher than 2006, primarily from lower production at Yanacocha and
Australia, as well as higher labor, consumables and energy prices in all operating regions. Additionally, future potential power interruptions in Ghana could further impact the Company’s

Costs applicable to sales

in 2007.

•

The Company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 to $2.0 billion in 2007, with approximately one third invested in Nevada, one third in
Australia/New Zealand and the remaining one third invested at the other locations. Approximately $0.8 to $0.9 billion of the 2007 capital budget is allocated to sustaining investments, with the remaining $1.0 to $1.1 billion allocated to new project
development and improvement initiatives, including the Boddington project, continued development of the power plant in Nevada and completion of the Yanacocha gold mill.

•

We expect 2007 exploration expenditures of approximately $170 to $175 and 2007 advanced projects, research and development expenditures of approximately $85 to
$100; and

•

The construction of the Boddington project, the 200 megawatt coal-fired power plant in Nevada and the gold mill at Yanacocha, as well as potential future
investments in the Akyem project in Ghana and the Conga project in Peru will require significant funds for capital expenditures. At current gold and copper prices, new sources of capital will be needed to meet the funding requirements of these
investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new



sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices and our operational performance, among other factors. In the
event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities and pay
dividends could be significantly constrained.

Accounting Developments

Pensions

As of December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 158,
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (“FAS 158”). FAS 158 required employers that sponsor one or more
defined benefit plans to (i) recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in its statement of financial position, (ii) recognize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period as a component of other
comprehensive income, net of tax, (iii) measure the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end statement of financial position, and (iv) disclose in the notes to the financial
statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. The impact of
adopting FAS 158 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows:

Stock Based Compensation

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R), “

Share-Based
Paymen

t” (“FAS 123(R)”). The Company adopted FAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. Under this method, compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes: a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted
prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of FAS 123, and b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1,
2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123(R).

As a result of adopting FAS 123(R),
the Company’s Income from continuing operations and Net income for 2006 is $19 ($0.04 per share) lower, than if we had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB 25 as we did in the comparable prior year periods. Prior to the
adoption of FAS 123(R), cash retained as a result of tax deductions relating to stock-based compensation was included in operating cash flows, along with other tax cash flows. FAS 123(R) requires tax benefits relating to the deductibility of
increases in the equity instruments issued under share-based compensation arrangements that are not included in Costs applicable to sales (“excess tax benefits”) to be presented in the Statement of Cash Flows as financing cash
inflows. The benefit realized for tax deductions from option exercises totaled $3 in 2006.

Deferred Stripping Costs

On January 1, 2006 the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-06 (“EITF 04-06”),
“Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry.” EITF 04-06 addresses the



accounting for stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine and refers to these costs as variable production costs that should be included
as a component of inventory to be recognized in

Costs applicable to sales

in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory. As a result, capitalization of post-production stripping costs is appropriate only to the extent product
inventory exists at the end of a reporting period. The guidance required the recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption, with no charge to earnings in the period of adoption for prior
periods. The cumulative effect adjustment reduced retained earnings by $81 (net of tax and minority interests) and eliminated the $71 net deferred stripping asset from the balance sheet. Adoption of EITF 04-06 had no impact on the Company’s
cash position or net cash from operations.

Consolidation of Batu Hijau

In December 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46R (“FIN 46R”), which provides guidance on the identification and reporting for entities
over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. FIN 46R defines such entities as variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Newmont identified the Nusa Tenggara Partnership (“NTP”) and P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara
(“PTNNT”) (collectively, “Batu Hijau”) as VIEs. Therefore, as of January 1, 2004, the Company has fully consolidated Batu Hijau in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Under the Batu Hijau Contract of Work, a portion of the project must be offered for sale to the Indonesian government or to Indonesian nationals.
Therefore, it is possible that future changes in the Company’s economic ownership interest in Batu Hijau would result in the Company accounting for its investment in Batu Hijau using the equity method of accounting, significantly impacting the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In this case, Batu Hijau revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, minority interests and cash flows would no longer be individually reported in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company’s share of Batu Hijau net income would be reported as

Equity income of affiliates

in the Statements of Consolidated Income, the net investment in Batu Hijau would be included in

Investments

in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and dividends received from Batu Hijau would be reported in

Operating activities

in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.

Upon consolidation of Batu Hijau, effective January 1, 2004, certain adjustments were recorded to the opening balance sheet of PTNNT to conform to Newmont’s accounting policies. These adjustments were recorded to change from
units-of-production depreciation of processing plant and mining facilities to straight-line depreciation of such facilities and to change from allocating costs to stockpile inventories based on mining costs per ton to allocating costs based on
recoverable pounds of copper equivalent contained in the various categories of stockpiles. The impact of these adjustments was a charge of $47, net of income tax expense and minority interest which has been recorded in

Cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle, net of tax

in the 2004 Statement of Consolidated Income.

Critical Accounting Policies

Listed below are the accounting policies that the Company believes are critical
to its financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported

.

Carrying Value of Goodwill

As
of December 31, 2006, the carrying value of goodwill was approximately $3,004. Goodwill was assigned to the Company’s Merchant Banking ($1,661) and Exploration ($1,129) Segments and to various mine site reporting units in the Australia/New
Zealand Segment ($214). Substantially all of this goodwill arose in connection with our February 2002 acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada, and represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net
assets. Our approach to allocating goodwill was to identify those reporting units that we believed had contributed to such excess purchase price. We then performed valuations to



measure the incremental increases in the fair values of such reporting units that were attributable to the acquisitions, and that were not already captured
in the fair values assigned to such units’ identifiable net assets. In the case of the Merchant Banking and Exploration Segments, these valuations were based on each reporting unit’s potential for future growth, and in the case of the mine
site reporting units, the valuation was based on the merger-related synergies that were expected to be realized by each mine site reporting unit.

We evaluate, on at least an annual basis, the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether current events and circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may no longer be recoverable. To accomplish this, we compare the estimated
fair values of the reporting units to their carrying amounts. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value at the time of the evaluation, we would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its
carrying amount and any shortfall would be charged to earnings. Assumptions underlying fair value estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties. Newmont performed its annual impairment tests of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2006 and
determined that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2006. A similar assessment by the Company during the fourth quarter of 2005 determined that the Nevada reporting unit was impaired as of December 31, 2005. To the extent the
assumptions used in the Company’s valuation models, described below, for such impairment tests are not achieved in the future, it is reasonably possible that the Company will record charges for impairment of goodwill in future periods. The
specific application of the Company’s goodwill impairment policy with respect to the Merchant Banking Segment, Exploration Segment and mine site reporting units is separately discussed below.

Merchant Banking Segment Goodwill

Newmont’s Merchant Banking Segment is comprised of an equity portfolio, focused on managing the Company’s portfolio of equity securities, a royalty portfolio, portfolio management activities, providing in-house investment banking
and advisory services to the Company, and downstream business activities.

As of December 31, 2006, the $1,661 carrying value of the
Merchant Banking Segment goodwill represented approximately 54% of the carrying value of the total assets of the Merchant Banking Segment. Based on a December 31, 2006 valuation of the Merchant Banking Segment, the Company concluded that the
fair value of the Merchant Banking Segment was significantly in excess of its carrying value as of December 31, 2006.

The
December 31, 2006 discounted cash flow analysis for the Equity Portfolio of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; (iii) pre-tax returns on investment ranging from 35%
in 2007 and gradually declining to 15% in 2014 through 2016; (iv) an initial equity portfolio investment of approximately $1,400; (v) capital infusions of $50 annually for the next three years; and (vi) a terminal value of
approximately $5,400.

The December 31, 2006 discounted cash flow analysis for the Royalty Portfolio of the Merchant Banking Segment
assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; (iii) an annual growth rate of 5% in the Royalty Portfolio; and (iv) a pre-tax rate of return on investment of 13%.

The December 31, 2006 discounted cash flow analysis for the Portfolio Management of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate
of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; and (iii) a pre-tax advisory fee of 5% on approximately $500 of transactions and value-added activities in 2007, with the dollar amount of such transactions and activities increasing by 5% annually
thereafter.

The December 31, 2006 discounted cash flow analysis for the downstream business of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed:
(i) a discount rate of 9%; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; and (iii) a pre-tax annual return on investment of 15%. The December 31, 2006 discounted cash flow analysis assumed a combined terminal value for the royalty portfolio,
portfolio management and downstream business of approximately $700.

For purposes of valuing the Merchant Banking Segment in the future,
the Company expects that the valuation model will continue to be reevaluated and enhanced to recognize the activities and objectives of the



Merchant Banking Segment. The key drivers of such future valuations are expected to include (i) expected long-term investment returns, adjusted for
Company specific and market driven factors; (ii) expected economic value to be added by the Merchant Banking Segment in addition to such investment returns; (iii) the level of capital accessible by the Merchant Banking Segment; and
(iv) other relevant facts and circumstances. To determine the appropriate returns, investment levels and other assumptions for purposes of this analysis, the Company will (i) review the expected and actual returns from transactions that
were initiated and/or completed since the last impairment test; (ii) assess the actual economic value added by other Merchant Banking Segment activities since the last impairment test; and (iii) assess the ongoing appropriateness of all
assumptions impacting the valuation based on then current conditions and expectations. The Company believes that any model used to value the Merchant Banking Segment will need to take into account the relatively long time horizon required to
evaluate the investment returns and other economic value added activities of the Merchant Banking Segment.

A high degree of judgment is
involved in determining the assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of the Merchant Banking Segment. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from the corresponding assumptions and
estimates. If a triggering event were to occur that could reasonably be expected to result in an impairment of the carrying value of the Merchant Banking Segment, the Company would be required to test the goodwill assigned to the Merchant Banking
Segment as of the end of the reporting period in which any such event occurred. The Company believes that triggering events with respect to the Merchant Banking Segment could include, but are not limited to: (i) the Company’s partial or
complete withdrawal of financial support for the Merchant Banking Segment; (ii) a significant reduction in management’s long-term expectation of the price of gold or oil, given the adverse effect such a development could have on the fair
values of the Merchant Banking Segment’s investment and royalty interest portfolios and the Merchant Banking Segment’s prospects for future growth; (iii) the divestiture of a significant portion of the Merchant Banking Segment’s
investment portfolio together with management’s determination not to fund the replenishment of such portfolio for the foreseeable future; and (iv) any other event that might adversely affect the ability of the Merchant Banking Segment to
consummate transactions that create value for the Company. The Company currently has no plans to withdraw financial support for the Merchant Banking Segment. For a discussion of the results of operations of the Merchant Banking Segment, see Results
of Consolidated Operations, Merchant Banking Segment, below.

Exploration Segment Goodwill

The Exploration Segment is responsible for all activities, whether near-mine or greenfield, associated with the Company’s efforts to discover new
mineralized material that could ultimately advance into proven and probable reserves. As discussed in greater detail below, when performing its Exploration Segment goodwill impairment testing, the Company uses historic additions to proven and
probable reserves as an indication of the expected future performance of the Exploration Segment.

The Exploration Segment’s valuation
model attributes all cash flows expected to be derived from future exploration discoveries, whether near-mine or greenfield, to the Exploration Segment. Therefore, the valuation model includes all expected value from future discoveries, including
existing and future mine site reporting units. Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part of the measured,
indicated or inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The value beyond proven and probable reserves relating
to mine site reporting units (which uses the same valuation concepts as required by EITF 04-03,

Mining Assets: Impairment and Business Combinations

) is excluded when determining the fair value of the Exploration Segment, if any, at
acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired.

The valuation model includes management’s best
estimates of future reserve additions from exploration activities and all revenues and costs associated with their discovery, development and production. Historical proven and probable reserve additions, excluding acquisitions, are used as an
indicator of the Exploration Segment’s ability to discover additional reserves in the future. Actual reserve additions may vary significantly



from year to year due to the time required to advance a deposit from initial discovery to proven and probable reserves and based on the timing of when proven
and probable reserves can be reported under the Securities and Exchange Commission Industry Guide 7. The valuation model assumes that the Company will be able to perpetually develop and produce the assumed additions to proven and probable reserves
from future discoveries at existing or new mine site reporting units. These estimates assume that the Company will continue to find reserves of sufficient size and quality to meet the Company’s operational and return thresholds in increasing
quantities in perpetuity. Future discoveries could become increasingly difficult to locate, and even if the Company finds reserves in a sufficient quality and size, they may consist of a larger number of smaller deposits that could be more costly to
develop and or operate than historically experienced. The development and production of reserves will eventually lead to the depletion of existing mine site reporting units and require the perpetual development of new mines in increasing quantities
through successful greenfield exploration. A reduction in reserves or a lower than expected increase in reserve additions, or a greater than expected increase in operating, capital or finding costs, may negatively impact the value of the Exploration
Segment and may result in the impairment of the Exploration Segment’s goodwill.

Subsequent to the business combinations for which
value beyond proven and probable reserves were recorded, EITF 04-03,

Mining Assets: Impairment and Business Combinations,

was issued and requires that value beyond proven and probable reserves be allocated to mining assets consistent with the
Company’s existing policy. The Company has defined value beyond proven and probable reserves as the value of known mineralization other than proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred
resource base that is measured based on extrapolation of known exploration information, to the extent that it believes a market participant would include such value in determining the fair value of the assets. The Company’s interpretation of
value beyond proven and probable reserves may differ from that of other mining industry companies and may result in a different allocation of values at the time of acquisition and subsequent impairment analysis. If value beyond proven and probable
reserves was interpreted to include value in excess of the Company’s determination, such values would be considered tangible mineral interests and therefore reduce the implied fair value of goodwill. Under such an interpretation, if Step 2 of a
goodwill impairment analysis (which requires the Company to compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount and write write-off any excess carrying amount over the implied fair value) was required for the existing Exploration
Segment, goodwill could be significantly impaired resulting in an impairment loss in the financial statements. The Company has not been required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test for the Exploration Segment. Please see the
Company’s Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional details.

The Company’s approach to managing the exploration
aspect of its business separate from the day to day operations of its mine site reporting units may differ from the approach taken by other companies in the mining industry. Other mining companies may integrate the exploration function with their
mine site reporting units, allocating residual goodwill to these units. Absent our Exploration Segment’s success and reporting structure, we may have reached a similar conclusion regarding the goodwill allocation. As a result of these potential
differences, the Company’s financial position and results of operations may not be comparable to those of other entities in the mining industry.

Internally generated proven and probable reserve additions are attributed to the Exploration Segment for purposes of determining the Company’s assumptions with respect to the expected future performance of the
Exploration Segment only to the extent that such additions are derived from (i) a discovery made by the Company; or (ii) a discovery made on previously acquired properties as a result of exploration efforts conducted subsequent to the
acquisition date. A portion of the additions to proven and probable reserves during 2004 through 2006 was derived from the conversion of mineralized material that had been assigned value as part of the purchase price allocation process. In addition,
the Company expects that a portion of internally generated reserve additions during 2007 and the next several years will also be derived from the conversion of mineralized material which had been assigned value as part of purchase price accounting.
To avoid duplication, the reserves which are expected to be derived from this mineralized material in the future are excluded from the reserve additions used in the valuation of the Exploration Segment performed in connection with the Company’s
goodwill impairment tests.



As of December 31, 2006, the $1,129 carrying value of the Exploration Segment goodwill represented
approximately 87% of the carrying value of the total assets of the Exploration Segment. Based on valuations of the Exploration Segment as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company concluded that substantially all of the fair value of the
Exploration Segment, which was significantly in excess of the carrying value, was derived from the terminal value. Based on the period required to advance projects from initial discovery to production, the valuation model has negative net cash flows
for approximately the first 10 years and more than 100% of the fair value of the Exploration Segment is attributable to its terminal value. The valuation models included the following assumptions:

The cash flow assumptions used in the valuation models are burdened only to the extent of
management’s estimate of the Company’s internal costs to explore, develop and produce the expected discoveries based on the Company’s historical experience and long-term plans. The cost assumptions may not be representative of what a
third party would be required to pay for access to the Company’s properties. The annual reserve addition and terminal growth rate assumptions have a significant impact on the fair value of the Exploration Segment. Due to the shortfall in
reserve additions during the last two years, the Company has revised its assumptions for initial year additions to gold reserves and the annual reserve addition and terminal growth rate. If these rate assumptions were reduced further from 4% to 3%,
the fair value of the Exploration Segment would have been approximately $1,000 lower as of December 31, 2006. Price and cost assumptions were updated to reflect the Company’s long-term planning assumptions. As of December 31, 2006 and
2005, the terminal value of the Exploration Segment was approximately $5.2 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively.



The December 31, 2006 Exploration Segment goodwill valuation model assumes proven and probable
reserve additions attributable to the Exploration Segment of 8.0 million equity ounces in 2007. Actual proven and probable additions attributable to the Exploration segment for 2006, 2005 and 2004 compared to assumptions used as of
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were as follows:

(1)

Additions assumed in the Exploration Segment valuation models for 2006 as of December 31, 2005, for
2005 as of December 31, 2004 and for 2004 as of December 31, 2003.

Triggering events that impact certain
assumptions used in the Exploration Segment valuation model and require an asset impairment evaluation with respect to the Exploration Segment would include, but are not limited to: (i) the Company’s partial or complete withdrawal of
financial support for the Exploration Segment; (ii) a significantly lower assumed annual reserve addition growth rate; (iii) a significant decrease in the Company’s long-term expectation of the price of gold; (iv) a significant
change in the financial markets resulting in a significant increase in the discount rate; (v) a significant increase in long-term operating, capital and finding cost estimates; and (vi) a significant impairment at an existing mine location
(an impairment could call into question the projections of future exploration success which are based on historical results both positive and negative). The Company currently has no plans to withdraw financial support for the Exploration Segment.
For a discussion of the results of operations of the Exploration Segment, see Results of Consolidated Operations, Exploration Segment, below.

Mine Site Goodwill

The assignment of goodwill to mine site reporting units was based on synergies that have been
incorporated into the Company’s operations and business plans over time and from the purchase of an additional 22.22% of the Boddington project in Australia during 2006. The amount of goodwill assigned to each segment or reporting unit was
based on discounted cash flow analyses that assumed risk-adjusted discount rates over the remaining lives of the applicable mining operations. The Company believes that triggering events with respect to the goodwill assigned to mine site reporting
units could include, but are not limited to: (i) a significant decrease in the Company’s long-term gold and copper price assumptions; (ii) a decrease in reserves; (iii) a significant reduction in the estimated fair value of mine
site exploration potential; and (iv) any event that might otherwise adversely affect mine site production levels or costs. The Company performed its annual impairment test of mine site goodwill as of December 31, 2006 and determined that
the fair value of each mine site reporting unit was in excess of the relevant carrying value as of December 31, 2006. For more information on the discounted cash flows used to value mine site reporting units, see Carrying Value of Long-Lived
Assets, below.



Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization

Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and
depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the
useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine.

Costs incurred to develop new properties are
capitalized as incurred, where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. At the Company’s surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore
body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At the Company’s underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure
development. All such costs are amortized using the units-of-production (“UOP”) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves.

Major development costs incurred after the commencement of production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be
produced from proven and probable reserves. Depending upon whether the development is expected to benefit the entire remaining ore body, or specific ore blocks or areas only, the UOP basis is either the life of the entire ore body or the life of the
specific ore block or area.

The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations,
could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in
any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These factors could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of
production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. Such changes in
reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves.

The expected useful lives used in depreciation, depletion and amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as
described above. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for purpose of depreciation, depletion and
amortization calculations.

Carrying Value of Stockpiles

Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number
of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces based on assay data, and the estimated recovery percentage based on the expected processing method. Stockpile tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Stockpiles are
valued based on mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable depreciation, depletion and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are added to a stockpile based on current mining costs and removed at
the average cost per recoverable ounce of gold in the stockpile. Stockpiles are reduced as material is removed and processed further. The adoption of EITF 04-06 resulted in the allocation of deferred and advanced stripping costs to stockpiles and
the value of the Company’s stockpiles decreased from $532 as of December 31, 2005 to $515 as of January 1, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the Company’s stockpiles had a total carrying value of $743.

Costs that are incurred in or benefit from the productive process are accumulated as stockpiles. The Company records stockpiles at the lower of average
cost or net realizable value (“NRV”), and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. NRV represents the estimated future sales price of the product based on prevailing



and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record
write-downs of stockpiles include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and actual production levels. During the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, write-downs of stockpiles to NRV totaled $2, $10 and $10, respectively.

Cost allocation to
stockpiles and the NRV measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable
reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and
assumptions.

Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may
not be recoverable. An asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded
based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related
factors), production levels and costs of production, capital and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine plans. The significant assumptions in determining the future discounted cash flows for each mine site reporting unit as of
December 31, 2006, apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $550 per ounce and Australian and Canadian dollar exchange rates of A$1.33 and CDN$1.11,
respectively per $1.00.

Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization
other than proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in
determining whether the assets are impaired. The term “recoverable minerals” refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates
of recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management’s relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are
identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups.

As discussed above under Depreciation,
Depletion and Amortization, various factors could impact the Company’s ability to achieve its forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally, production, capital and reclamation costs could differ from the
assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to
mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as other mine-related exploration
potential and greenfields exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling.

Stripping Costs

Stripping
costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that are included as a component of inventory to be recognized in

Costs applicable to sales

in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory.
Capitalization of post-production stripping costs is appropriate only to the extent product inventory exists at the end of a reporting period.



Prior to 2006 (see Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements) at some of the Company’s mining
operations, deferred stripping costs were charged to

Costs applicable to sales

as gold or copper was sold using the units of production method based on estimated recoverable quantities of proven and probable gold or copper reserves, using a
stripping ratio calculated as the ratio of total tons to be moved to total proven and probable ore reserves, which resulted in the recognition of the costs of waste removal activities over the life of the mine as gold or copper was sold. The
application of the deferred stripping accounting method generally resulted in an asset (deferred stripping costs), although a liability (advanced stripping costs) arose when the actual stripping ratio incurred to date was less than the expected
stripping ratio over the life of the mine. The

Advanced stripping costs

primarily pertained to the Batu Hijau operation.

Financial Instruments

All financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance
sheet at fair market value, with the exception of contracts that qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption. Changes in the fair market value of derivatives recorded on the balance sheet are recorded in the statements of
consolidated operations, except for the effective portion of the change in fair market value of derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedge and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. The Company’s portfolio of derivatives includes
various complex instruments that are linked to gold prices and other factors. Management applies significant judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding gold and other commodity prices,
gold lease rates, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair market value of derivatives. In
addition, certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the effective portion of changes in fair market value of these instruments are deferred in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

and will be recognized in
the statements of consolidated operations when the underlying production designated as the hedged item is sold. All derivative contracts qualifying for hedge accounting are designated against the applicable portion of future production from proven
and probable reserves, where management believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. To the extent that management determines that such future production is no longer probable of occurring due to changes in the factors impacting the
determination of reserves, as discussed above under

Depreciation, depletion and amortization

, gains and losses deferred in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

would be reclassified to the statements of consolidated operations
immediately.

Reclamation and Remediation Obligations (Asset Retirement Obligations)

Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present
value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and remediation costs. The asset retirement obligation is based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance
will occur. The Company reviews, on at least an annual basis, the asset retirement obligation at each mine site in accordance with FASB FAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.”

Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on management’s best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be
incurred. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, water treatment, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised.

Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs the
Company will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental
laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation.



Deferred Tax Assets

The Company recognizes the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being
realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the
application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer above under Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and
taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company
operates could limit the Company’s ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by its deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date.

Consolidated Financial Results

Sales—gold, net

increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a $158
per ounce increase in the average realized price, partially offset by a decrease in ounces sold. In 2005, gold sales increased over 2004 primarily due to a $29 per ounce increase in the average realized price, partially offset by a decrease in
ounces sold. For a complete discussion regarding variations in gold volumes, see

Results of Consolidated Operations

The
following analysis reflects the increase in consolidated gold sales:

The change in consolidated gold sales is due to:

Sales—copper, net

were unchanged in 2006 compared to 2005 as lower sales volumes were
offset by higher realized prices. In addition, in 2006 a loss of $56 was included in

Other income, net

for the ineffective portion of copper hedges. In 2005, copper sales decreased compared to 2004 due to a 16% decrease in copper pounds sold,
partially offset by a 9% increase in the average realized copper price. For a complete discussion regarding variations in copper volumes, see

Results of Consolidated Operations

The following analysis reflects the changes in consolidated copper sales:

The change in consolidated copper sales is due to:



The following is a summary of net gold and copper sales:

Costs applicable to sales—gold

increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher labor
and input commodity prices and lower grades at Nevada, Batu Hijau and Yanacocha, higher waste removal at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau, as well as increased operating costs from the start-up of Phoenix and Leeville in Nevada and Ahafo in Ghana. The
increase in 2005 from 2004 resulted primarily from increased operating costs in Nevada and at Yanacocha.

Costs applicable to sales—copper

were $308 and $303 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Newmont has seen significant increases in the
costs of labor, fuel, power and other consumables during these periods. For a complete discussion regarding variations in operations, see

Results of Consolidated Operations

below.



The following is a summary of

Costs applicable to sales

by operation:

Deferred stripping.

The net deferred stripping amounts included in

Costs applicable to sales

by operation were as follows:

See Accounting Developments, above.



Depreciation, depletion and amortization

remained at the same level in 2006 from 2005, as
capital spending increases from the start-up of Phoenix and Leeville in Nevada and Ahafo in Ghana and capital expenditures at other operations were offset by lower production at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau. The decrease in 2005 from 2004 primarily
resulted from the disposition of the Ovacik mine in Turkey and lower consolidated ounces sold.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization

expense fluctuates as capital expenditures increase or decrease and as production levels increase or
decrease. For a complete discussion, see

Results of Consolidated Operations

, below. Newmont expects

Depreciation, depletion and amortization

to increase to approximately $800 to $865 in 2007.

The following is a summary of

Depreciation, depletion and amortization

by operation:

Exploration

period-to-period increases reflect increased exploration and related activity
in response to higher gold prices and increased labor and consumable costs.

Advanced projects, research and development

costs represent spending on advanced projects, feasibility studies and drilling at Phoenix, Martabe, Akyem, Ahafo and
Conga. Newmont expects

Exploration

to be approximately $170 to $175 and

Advanced projects, research and development

to be approximately $85 to $100 in 2007.



General and administrative

expense increased in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to $12 of stock
option expense.

General and administrative

expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.0% in 2006, compared to 3.1% in 2005 and 2.7% in 2004. Newmont expects

General and administrative

expenses to be approximately $155 to $165 in 2007,
including $10 in stock option expense.

Write-down of goodwill

was $nil, $41 and $52 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005
expense was related to the Nevada segment resulting from anticipated increased future operating and capital costs. The 2004 expense was related to the Pajingo reporting unit in Australia resulting from anticipated increased future operating costs
and lower grade ore.

Write-down of long-lived assets

totaled $3, $43 and $39 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006
write-down primarily related to equipment. The 2005 write-down primarily related to the Martabe exploration project in Indonesia and exploration tenements in Australia. The 2004 write-down included $16 related to the Ovacik mine in Turkey. The
remainder of the write-down for 2004 was related to exploration tenements in Australia, mineral interests at Pajingo, and processing facilities at Yanacocha.

For a discussion of the Company’s policy for assessing the carrying value of its goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, see Critical Accounting Policies, above.

Other expense, net

includes the following:

The 2006 expense primarily includes changes in environmental obligation estimates at non-operating
sites, legal and other costs incurred in regards to pollution allegations at Minahasa and at Yanacocha, a new Peruvian royalty, costs associated with leach pad repairs and Peruvian worker’s participation reserves. The 2005 expense included
legal and other costs incurred in regards to pollution allegations at Minahasa, changes in environmental obligation estimates at other non-operating properties, costs incurred to stabilize material and repair damage to roads and utility lines for a
waste dump slide in Nevada and a pension settlement loss. The 2004 expense related to the closure of Minahasa, care and maintenance charges at Ovacik in Turkey, engineering and permitting expenses for the power plant in Nevada and other
miscellaneous expenses.



Other income, net

is summarized as follows:

During the third quarter of 2006, Merchant Banking completed the sale of the Alberta Oil Sands
project to the Korean National Oil Corporation and the Martabe project in Indonesia to Agincourt Resources Limited (“Agincourt”). Newmont received net cash proceeds of $271 for the Alberta Oil Sands project. Newmont received net cash
proceeds of $42 and approximately 43 million Agincourt shares valued at $37 for the Martabe project.

Royalty and dividend income
increased each year due to higher gold, oil and gas prices and higher distributions received from Canadian Oil Sands Trust, which was acquired during the second and third quarters of 2004.

Interest income increased each year due to increased funds invested and higher investment yields.

Income from development projects includes the gold and copper sales net of incremental operating costs incurred prior to commercial production at the
Leeville and Phoenix operations in Nevada.

The 2006 gain on investments is primarily related to the sale of Regis Resources NL and Pan
Australian Resources Ltd. which resulted in gains of $7 and $4, respectively. The gain on investments during 2005 was primarily attributable to the sale of investments in Kinross Gold Corporation and Oxiana Limited which resulted in gains of $20 and
$25, respectively. The loss on investments during 2004 was attributable to a $39 impairment of Kinross based on an extended decline in value of Kinross equity securities.

The 2006 gain on sale of other assets primarily related to additional proceeds from the sale of Ovacik. The gain on sale of other assets during 2005 was primarily attributable to the sale of the Mezcala gold deposit.
The 2004 gain on sale of other assets primarily resulted from the sales of Perama, Midwest Uranium and Bronzewing.

Newmont was the
guarantor of an A$71 (approximately $53) amortizing loan facility of QMC Finance Pty Ltd. (“QMC”) which was collateralized by the assets of the Queensland Magnesium Project. Newmont reduced the amount accrued for this contingent obligation
by the estimated fair value of the Australian Magnesium Corporation assets that would be subrogated to Newmont in the event the guarantee was called, which resulted in a $30 loss during 2003. During 2004, Newmont entered into a transaction resulting
in a loan from Newmont to a subsidiary of QMC for A$30 (approximately $23), the release of Newmont from its guarantee obligation and recognition of an $11 gain resulting from the release of all previously accrued contingent liabilities. An



allowance was provided for 100% of the loan receivable from the QMC entity. In 2005, a gain was recognized for A$12 (approximately $9), resulting from a
reduction in the allowance provided on the loan receivable.

On September 27, 2006, Newmont settled its remaining obligations under
the prepaid forward gold sales contract and forward gold purchase contract for which it was required to deliver 17,951 ounces of gold in December 2006 and 179,062 ounces of gold in June 2007. This settlement resulted in cash payments of $96, and
included a $48 reduction to the current portion of long-term debt and a $40 pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt.

The loss on
ineffective portion of derivative instruments includes a loss of $56 in 2006 for the ineffective portion of the copper collar instruments designated as cash flow hedges. Other losses relate to the ineffective portion of legacy gold puts in
Australia.

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest

was $97, $97 and
$97 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $57, $39 and $13 in each year, respectively. Interest costs increased each year due to the issuance of the $600 5


/


% notes in 2005 and the $200 bond issuance at Yanacocha in July 2006. These increases were offset each year by higher capitalized interest due to
construction of Leeville, Phoenix and the power plant in Nevada, the Ahafo project in Ghana and the Boddington project in Australia. Newmont expects

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest

to be approximately $95 to $105 in 2007.

Income tax expense

was $424 in 2006, compared to $310 and $324 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The effective tax rates were
26.1%, 29.6%, and 30.3% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The factors that most significantly impact the Company’s effective tax rate are percentage depletion and resource allowances, the rate differential related to foreign earnings
indefinitely invested, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits, earnings attributable to minority interests in subsidiaries and affiliated companies, foreign currency translation gains and
losses, impacts of the analysis of income taxes payable and U.S. book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the impact of certain specific transactions. Most of these factors are sensitive to the average realized price of
gold and other metals.

Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion that may exceed the Company’s tax basis in its
mineral reserves) are available to the Company under the income tax laws of the United States for operations conducted in the United States or through branches and partnerships owned by U.S. subsidiaries included in the Company’s consolidated
United States income tax return. The deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold and other minerals produced by the Company. For 2006 and prior years, similar types of deductions are available for mining operations in Canada. The tax
benefits from percentage depletion and resource allowances were $83, $47 and $47 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily is due to an increase in the Company’s average realized gold price.

The Company operates in various countries around the world that have tax laws, tax incentives and tax rates that are significantly
different than those of the United States. Many of these differences combine to move the Company’s overall effective tax rate higher or lower than the United States statutory rate depending on the mix of income relative to income earned in the
United States. The effect of these differences is shown in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as either a foreign rate differential or the effect of foreign earnings, net of credits. Differences in tax rates and other foreign income tax
law variations make the Company’s ability to fully utilize all of its available foreign income tax credits on a year-by-year basis highly dependent on the price of the gold and copper produced by the Company and the costs of production, since
lower prices or higher costs can result in the Company having insufficient sources of taxable income in the United States to utilize all available foreign tax credits. Such credits have limited carry back and carry forward periods and can only be
used to reduce the United States income tax imposed on the Company’s foreign earnings included in its annual United States consolidated income tax return. The effects of foreign earnings, net of allowable credits, were an increase of income tax
expense of $9, $12 and $25, in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The effect of different income tax rates in countries where earnings are indefinitely reinvested contributed to an increase in the Company’s income tax expense of $79, $8 and $61
in 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively.



The tax effect of changes in local country tax laws, as shown in the Company’s effective tax
reconciliation in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, resulted in a net tax benefit of $22, $24 and $51 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The net tax benefit in 2006 is primarily related to a decrease in the Canadian federal and
provincial statutory tax rates. The net tax benefit in 2005 and 2004 is primarily related to a change in Australian tax law regarding the ability of the company to file consolidated income tax returns.

The Company adopted the U.S. dollar as its functional currency for Australian tax reporting purposes. This change will eliminate fluctuations in the
effective tax rate that resulted from foreign currency exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and Australian dollar. The change resulted in a tax benefit of $48 in 2006.

The need to record valuation allowances related to the Company’s deferred tax assets (primarily attributable to net operating losses and tax
credits) is principally dependent on the following factors: (i) the extent to which the net operating losses and tax credits can be carried back and yield a tax benefit; (ii) the Company’s long-term estimate of future average realized
minerals prices; and (iii) the degree to which many of the tax laws and income tax agreements imposed upon the Company and its subsidiaries around the world tend to create significant tax deductions early in the mining process. These up-front
deductions can give rise to net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards in circumstances where future sources of taxable income may not coincide with available carry forward periods even after taking into account all available tax planning
strategies. Furthermore, certain liabilities, accrued for financial reporting purposes, may not be deductible for tax purposes until such liabilities are actually funded which could happen after mining operations have ceased, when sufficient sources
of taxable income may not be available. Changes to valuation allowances decreased income tax expense by $27 in 2006, increased income tax expense by $22 in 2005, and decreased income tax expense by $58 in 2004. This utilization primarily is due to
generation of low taxed, foreign sourced income, in addition to higher sources of taxable income in the United States resulting from the increase in the Company’s average realized gold price in 2006. The release of valuation allowance on
capital loss carry forwards was due to the realization of capital gains outside the United States.

The Company, consolidates certain
subsidiaries of which it does not own 100% of the outstanding equity. However, for tax purposes, the Company is only responsible for the income taxes on the portion of the taxable earnings attributable to its ownership interest of each consolidated
entity. Such minority interests contributed $15, $15 and $7 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, as reductions in the Company’s income tax expense.

The Company’s tax expense decreased by $2, $14 and $13 in 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In 2005 and 2004, these amounts primarily relate to the Australian tax
effect of realized and unrealized translation gains attributable to United States dollar-denominated assets and liabilities and the gold derivatives positions at Newmont Australia Limited whose functional currency is the United States dollar.
Because Newmont intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from Newmont Australia Limited, no offsetting United States deferred income tax effect can be recorded.

During 2006 the Company completed a reconciliation of its U.S. book and tax basis assets and liabilities as well as a detailed analysis of its income taxes payable. This exercise identified differences of $27. The
entire adjustment was recognized as a tax benefit in 2006. The Company also recognized a net tax benefit of $16 due to an adjustment on the interest accrued on tax contingencies.

Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing the Company’s effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such
factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, the effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. The effective tax rate is expected to be between 29% and 34% in 2007.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (“FIN 48”) an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax



position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 requires that the Company recognize in its financial statements, the impact of a tax position,
if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and
disclosure. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective beginning January 1, 2007 with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, goodwill, deferred income taxes
and income taxes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures.

Minority interest in income of subsidiaries

decreased in 2006 from 2005 as a result of lower production and earnings at Batu Hijau (see Results of
Consolidated Operations, Batu Hijau Operations). The 2005 increase from 2004 resulted from increased earnings at Yanacocha due to increased gold price and ounces sold, partially offset by an increase in costs (see Results of Consolidated Operations,
Yanacocha Operations).

Equity income (loss) of affiliates

was as follows:

The

Loss from discontinued operations

of $49 in 2006 resulted from the Holloway and
Zarafshan gold operations being discontinued from sale and expropriation, respectively. The Company reclassified the income statement results from the historical presentation to discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for
all periods presented. The Company recorded a pre-tax impairment loss of $101 as a result of the Uzbekistan government’s expropriation of the Zarafshan operation. A $13 pre-tax gain was recorded for the sale of the Holloway operation. The 2005
loss of $38 was primarily due to a $42 pre-tax write-down of long-lived assets as a result of the classification of the Golden Grove copper-zinc operation in Australia as a discontinued operation. A $6 pre-tax gain was recorded later in 2005 for the
sale of Golden Grove. The gain of $79 in 2004 was primarily due to a tax credit related to Golden Grove from an election to prepare a consolidated tax return in Australia (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax

was $47 effective January 1, 2004 resulting from the consolidation of Batu
Hijau to conform Batu Hijau’s accounting policies to Newmont’s accounting policies. See Accounting Developments, above, for more information.

Other comprehensive income, net of tax

in 2006 included a $272 gain in value of marketable securities, $47 for unrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and $17 related to a minimum pension
liability adjustment, offset by a loss of $14 on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies.

Other comprehensive income, net of tax

in 2005 included a $282 gain in value of marketable equity securities and a
$26 gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, offset by losses of $18 related to a minimum pension liability adjustment and $59 for unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.

Other
comprehensive income, net of tax

in 2004 included a $123 gain in value of marketable equity securities and a $31 gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, offset by losses of $11 related to a minimum
pension liability adjustment and $19 for unrealized losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.



Results of Consolidated Operations

(1)

Includes incremental start-up ounces of 100,300 and 22,100 in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

(2)

Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization.

(3)

Consolidated gold ounces or copper pounds sold includes minority interests’ share.

(4)

Economic interest decreased to 52.875% from 56.25% on October 1, 2004.

Consolidated gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005 due to:

•

decreased sales at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau due to lower grade ores and lower throughput at Batu Hijau;

•

the completion of operations at Lone Tree (Nevada) and Golden Giant (Other); partially offset by

•

the start-up of operations at Ahafo (Ghana) and Leeville and Phoenix (Nevada).

Consolidated gold ounces sold decreased in 2005 from 2004 due to:

•

lower grade ores processed in Nevada and Australia/New Zealand;

•

the dispositions of Ovacik (Other) and Bronzewing (Australia/New Zealand); and

•

the completion of operations at Minahasa (Other); partially offset by

•

increased sales at Yanacocha.

Consolidated copper pounds sold decreased in 2006 and 2005 due to the processing of lower grade ore (0.55% vs. 0.69%) and lower mill throughput due to mine plan changes and harder material.

Consolidated copper pounds sold also decreased in 2005 from 2004 due to the processing of lower grade ore (0.69% vs. 0.75%) after access to ore in the
lower portion of the pit was restricted as a result of several small pit wall slides during the first quarter of 2005.

Costs applicable
to sales

per consolidated gold ounce sold increased in 2006 from 2005 and in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to the decrease in production at Yanacocha, Batu Hijau, and Australia/New Zealand and increased operating costs in Nevada, Yanacocha, Batu
Hijau and Australia/New Zealand.

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated copper pound increased from year-to-year due to the decrease in copper production and increased operating costs.

The Company expects consolidated gold sales of approximately 6.1 to 6.6 million ounces in 2007, primarily as a result of lower production from
Yanacocha and Australia, as well as the closure of Lone Tree in Nevada and



Golden Giant in Canada in 2006.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce for 2007 are expected to be approximately 25% higher than 2006, primarily from
lower production at Yanacocha and Australia, as well as expected higher labor, consumables and energy prices in all operating regions. Additionally, future potential power interruptions in Ghana could further impact the Company’s

Costs
applicable to sales

in 2007.

The Company expects consolidated copper sales of approximately 400 to 435 million pounds of copper
in 2007 at

Costs applicable to sales

of approximately $1.10 to $1.20 per pound.

Nevada Operations

Nevada gold ounces sold increased by 90,000 ounces in 2006 from 2005, due to the commencement of commercial operations at Phoenix and Leeville in the
fourth quarter of 2006 and increased access to open pit ore at the Twin Creeks layback, partially offset by lower production from Lone Tree. The Phoenix project commenced commercial operations on October 1, 2006, followed by the Leeville
project on October 14, 2006. Leeville and Phoenix produced 243,700 ounces in 2006, including 100,300 incremental start-up ounces included in

Other income, net

. Gold production at Lone Tree declined as mining was completed in 2006.
Overall, mill ore grade decreased 17% and mill throughput increased 16% as a result of the start-up of the lower grade Phoenix operation. Heap leach production was slightly higher than 2005 due to a 9% increase in average grade of ore placed on the
leach pads.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased 22%, primarily due to increased labor, diesel, power, cyanide and other commodity prices, higher underground contract service costs.

Costs applicable to sales

were also impacted
by the change in accounting for open pit waste removal costs. In 2005, $47 of mining costs was deferred which reduced

Costs applicable to sales

by $20 per ounce.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization

increased as a result of placing
new equipment and facilities in operation.

Gold ounces sold decreased in 2005 from 2004, as a 12% decrease in mill ore grade and sales
from inventories in 2004 were partially offset by an 18% increase in mill throughput and a 12% increase in heap leach ore placed. Adverse mill grades were caused by unfavorable ground conditions at underground operations and a labor shortage
impacting underground development. Ore placed on the leach pads increased by 12% in 2005 from 2004 due to increased open pit production from Carlin and Twin Creeks.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased 18%, primarily due to increased
labor, diesel and other commodity prices, a decrease in ounces produced and higher underground contract service costs. During the fourth quarter of 2005, Nevada recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $41 as a result of anticipated increased future
operating and capital costs.

Consolidated gold sales are expected to remain stable in 2007 at approximately 2.35 to 2.55 million
ounces. Higher production from Phoenix, Leeville and Twin Creeks is expected to be partially offset by the shut-down of Lone Tree at the end of 2006. Higher mill throughput and mill recoveries are expected to be offset by lower planned mill grades
and leach recoveries in 2007.

Costs applicable to sales

are also expected to remain stable in 2007 at approximately $375 to $400 per ounce. Ongoing labor and energy cost pressures are expected to be offset by reduced contracted services and
other expenses, as well as lower anticipated maintenance costs associated with a newer mining fleet.

Construction of a 200-megawatt
coal-fired power plant is approximately 37% complete as of December 31, 2006. Capital costs for the power plant are expected to be between $620 and $640 and completion is targeted for mid-2008.

Non-governmental organizations have brought a series of actions relating to the Nevada operations, as described in more detail in Note 29 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. While Newmont believes that the legal actions are without merit, unfavorable outcomes could result in additional conditions being imposed on the Company’s operations, and such conditions could have a material
adverse effect on Nevada’s results of operations or financial position.



Yanacocha Operations

Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to a decrease in ore tons mined and placed on the leach pads, as anticipated in the mine plan.
The proportion of waste tons mined increased from 0.50 waste tons per ton of ore in 2005 to 0.88 waste tons per ton of ore in 2006.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased due to the decrease in production, increased consumption and
prices of diesel, cyanide, lime and other commodities and higher worker’s participation bonuses and royalties due to increased gold prices, partially offset by increased silver by-product credits.

Gold ounces sold increased in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to a 12% increase in the grade of ore placed and a 10% increase in the total ore placed,
partially offset by timing of flows from the leach pads and increased inventory.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased due to increased workers’ participation payments, increased consumption of reagents and higher royalties due
to increased gold prices. Increased labor and commodity costs were partially offset by increased production, related allocation of costs to inventory and increased silver by-product credits.

Consolidated gold sales are expected to decrease in 2007 to approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million ounces, primarily as a result of lower throughput and
ore grades. Consolidated gold sales for 2008 through 2010 are expected to be approximately 1.6 to 1.8 million ounces per year.

Costs applicable to sales

at Yanacocha are expected to increase in 2007 to approximately $340 to $360 per
ounce, primarily as a result of lower production.

During 2004, Peru enacted legislation to establish a sliding scale mining royalty of up
to 3% based on the volume of mine production. The royalty is calculated on revenue from sales of product less certain refining and transportation expenses. While the Peruvian royalty became effective during the second quarter of 2004, it did not
apply to those projects that had tax stabilization agreements prior to the adoption of the royalty law. Virtually all of Yanacocha’s current production is derived from projects that were stabilized prior to the enactment of the royalty
legislation; however, future projects not covered by the tax stabilization agreements will be burdened by this royalty. In addition, the recent presidential, congressional and regional elections may result in changes to the government's positions on
regulations and policies that could impact Yanacocha's operations. Although the new administration has affirmed its intention to uphold these tax stabilization agreements, it is possible that the Congress will attempt to set aside these agreements
and impose the mining royalty on projects covered by such agreements or that additional payments may be required to address the perception that proceeds from mining activities should be more equitably shared.

In 2006, Yanacocha recorded a $22 charge to

Other expense, net

related to an agreement with the Peruvian government to provide for a royalty
payment for community improvements during current high metal prices. The negotiated royalty is based on 3.75% of Yanacocha’s net income beginning January 1, 2006 for a period of up to five years.

There is a collective bargaining agreement in place at Yanacocha through February 2007. The agreement is currently being re-negotiated. A minority of the
union membership staged a three-day strike in April 2006. The strike had no material impact on operations. There can be no assurance that future disputes will be resolved without disruption to operations.

In August 2006, Yanacocha resumed all mining and construction activities after a blockade that temporarily restricted access to the Yanacocha mine. The
Company signed agreements with the Peruvian government and duly appointed representatives of the protesting community members on August 30, 2006 to peacefully end the blockade. Yanacocha will participate in a high-level government commission to
continue to address the concerns of those community members.

Cerro Quilish is a deposit within the Yanacocha complex. In July 2004,
Yanacocha received a drilling permit for the Cerro Quilish deposit and commenced drilling activities to further define the deposit. During September 2004, individuals from the Cajamarca region, where Cerro Quilish is located, conducted a sustained
blockade of the road between the City of Cajamarca and the mine site, in protest of these exploration activities.



Yanacocha suspended all drilling activities at Cerro Quilish and the blockade was resolved. At the request of Yanacocha, the Cerro Quilish drilling permit
was revoked in November 2004. Yanacocha has reassessed the challenges involved in obtaining required permits for Cerro Quilish primarily related to increased community concerns. Based upon this reassessment, Yanacocha reclassified 3.9 million
ounces (2.0 million equity ounces) of gold from proven and probable reserves to mineralized material not in reserve as of December 31, 2004.

Australia/New Zealand Operations

(1)

Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization.

(2)

During 2004, Jundee included Bronzewing which ceased mining in the first quarter of 2004 and was sold
during the third quarter of 2004.

Australia/New Zealand operations sold fewer ounces of gold in 2006 compared to 2005,
primarily due to lower production resulting from decreased ore tons mined and lower mill throughput.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to the decreases in ounces sold, increased commodity costs
partially offset by depreciation of the Australian and New Zealand dollars compared to the U.S. dollar. The favorable foreign exchange movements decreased Australia/New Zealand

Costs applicable to sales

in 2006 from 2005 by $5 per ounce.

Costs applicable to sales

were also impacted by the change in accounting for open pit waste removal costs. In 2005, $7 of mining costs was deferred which reduced

Costs applicable to sales

by $5 per ounce.

In 2005, gold ounces sold decreased compared to 2004, primarily due to lower grades at Tanami and Kalgoorlie combined with lower throughput at Tanami and
Pajingo.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to the decreases in ounces sold, increased commodity costs and appreciation of the Australian and New Zealand dollars compared to the U.S. dollar. The
unfavorable foreign exchange movements increased Australia/New Zealand

Costs applicable to sales

in 2005 from 2004 by $15 per ounce.

Consolidated gold sales are expected to decline in 2007 to approximately 1.275 to 1.325 million ounces, primarily as a result of lower planned throughput and ore grades. At Martha, lower mill throughput is anticipated as a result of
planned mine sequencing adjustments. Lower anticipated ore grades at Tanami and planned ramp-down sequencing at Pajingo are also expected to contribute to declining gold sales in the region until Boddington begins production.

Costs applicable to
sales

are expected to increase to approximately $445 to $470 per ounce in 2007, primarily as a result of lower planned production and higher anticipated labor, electricity and fuel expenses.

Tanami, Australia

.    Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to a 23% decline in mill throughput
resulting from the completion of processing Groundrush stockpiles, partially offset by higher ore grade from the Granites.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased due to lower gold production and increased royalties due to the higher
gold price.



Gold ounces sold decreased in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to a 16% decline in ore grade from mining
lower grade zones of the Callie underground deposit and processing lower grade stockpiles at Groundrush. Mining was completed at Groundrush in 2004 and the lower grade stockpiles were exhausted in the third quarter of 2005.

Costs applicable to
sales

per ounce increased due to lower gold production, higher maintenance, diesel, power, ground support and surface works costs and appreciation of the Australian dollar.

Kalgoorlie, Australia

.    Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, due to lower mill throughput (harder ore), a decrease
in mill ore grade and a decrease in roaster throughput resulting from a higher sulfer to gold ratio and adverse weather conditions.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased due to lower production and increased labor, diesel and contract
services. Milling costs also increased due to mill maintenance costs and higher grinding costs due to the harder ore.

Costs applicable to sales

were also impacted by the change in accounting for open pit waste removal costs. In 2005, $9 of
mining costs was deferred which reduced

Costs applicable to sales

by $23 per ounce.

Gold ounces sold decreased in 2005 from 2004,
primarily due to a 7% decrease in ore grade milled and sales from inventories in 2004, partially offset by a 2% increase in tons milled.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased due to increased mill throughput, increased diesel, reagent
and power costs and appreciation of the Australian dollar.

Jundee, Australia

.    Gold ounces sold decreased in
2006 from 2005, due to a 4% decrease in tons milled and a 6% decrease in mill ore grade. The decrease in tons milled was attributable to severe weather conditions, flooding and an extended mill shutdown in the first half of the year.

Costs
applicable to sales

per ounce increased due to lower gold production and higher maintenance costs, partially offset by reduced mining activity.

Gold ounces sold decreased 10% in 2005 from 2004, due to the cessation of production at Bronzewing, partially offset by higher mill ore grade from Jundee. Processing at Bronzewing ceased during the second quarter of 2004 and Bronzewing was
sold the third quarter of 2004 (see Other Investing Activities, below).

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased due to higher underground contract services, steel, diesel and administration costs and appreciation of the Australian
dollar.

Pajingo, Australia

.    Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to a 14% decrease in
tons milled. The decrease in tons milled was attributable to ground control issues at Vera South Deeps and slower than planned access at Jandam.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased due to lower production, increased contract
services and equipment maintenance costs. Pajingo is approaching the end of its mine life, based on current mine plans, and operations are expected to be completed in 2008.

Gold ounces sold decreased in 2005 from 2004, due to a 19% decrease in ore milled as low grade stockpiles which supplemented production in 2004 were
exhausted.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased due to lower production and appreciation of the Australian dollar.

Martha, New Zealand

.    Gold ounces sold decreased in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to a 4% decrease in mill ore grade and a 20% decrease in mill throughput due to reduced open pit mining activity and the
commencement of Favona ore treatment which requires finer grinding.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased due to the decrease in gold production.

Gold ounces sold increased in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to a 37% increase in ore grade due to mine sequencing, partially offset by a 9% decrease in ore milled.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce decreased
due to increased production, partially offset by higher processing costs from harder ore and appreciation of the New Zealand dollar.



Batu Hijau Operations

(1)

Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization.

(2)

Consolidated gold ounces or copper pounds sold includes minority interests’ share.

(3)

Economic interest decreased to 52.875% from 56.25% on October 1, 2004.

Batu Hijau revised its mine plan in 2006 to address geotechnical instability of the operation’s east pit wall and
harder than modeled ore. Production was impacted by lower grades due to the mining sequence, as well as lower mill throughput due to processing harder ore. Copper and gold sales decreased in 2006 from 2005 as a result of lower copper (20%) and
gold (34%) ore grades, and lower mill throughput (6%). Total tons mined were 30% higher in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to the addition of new mining equipment, shorter hauling distance and increased shovel productivity.

Costs applicable to
sales

per pound of copper and per ounce of gold increased due to lower production, the expansion of the mining fleet and increased diesel, tire, labor and process maintenance costs, partially offset by an increased allocation of costs to
stockpile inventories. Short-term stockpiles were built for processing in 2007.

Copper sales decreased and gold sales increased slightly
in 2005 from 2004. Access to ore in the lower portion of the pit was restricted as a result of several small pit wall slides during the first quarter of 2005. As a result, the mine plan was revised, resulting in the processing of lower grade
stockpiles.

Costs applicable to sales

per pound of copper and per ounce of gold increased as a result of the decrease in production, increased fuel, maintenance, consumables, and labor costs.

Consolidated sales are expected to remain stable in 2007 at approximately 435,000 to 475,000 ounces of gold and approximately 395 to 435 million
pounds of copper. Consolidated gold and copper sales are expected to be positively impacted by higher grades and throughput, offset by lower copper recoveries.

Costs applicable to sales

are expected to increase in 2007 to approximately $225
to $240 per ounce of gold and approximately $1.10 to $1.20 per pound of copper. Increasing operating costs are expected to result primarily from higher stripping expenses, as well as rising fuel, energy and consumables prices.

As of October 1, 2004, cumulative losses had been recovered and Batu Hijau began to report positive retained earnings, allowing for the payment of
dividends, 6% of which are paid to the minority partner. Accordingly, Newmont began recognizing the minority interests in Batu Hijau at 47.125% (effective 52.875% Newmont share) of Batu Hijau’s earnings and will continue to do so until a loan
to the minority interest partner is fully repaid (including accrued interest). See Consolidated Financial Results above for more information.

Under the Contract of Work, beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2010, a portion of the project must be offered for sale to the Indonesian government or to Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between the following percentages
and the percentage of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 15%, by the end of 2005; 23%, by the end of 2006; 30%, by the end of 2007; 37%, by the end of 2008; 44%, by the end of
2009; and 51%, by the end of 2010. The price at which such interest must be offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares of the project company would be accepted for
listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or the fair market value of such interest in the project company as a going concern. Pursuant to this provision, it is possible that the ownership interest of the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership in Batu Hijau
could be reduced to 49% by the end of 2010.



A company owned by an Indonesian national currently owns a 20% interest in Batu Hijau, and therefore the
Newmont/Sumitomo partnership was required to offer a 3% interest for sale in 2006. An offer to sell a 3% interest was made to the government of Indonesia. While the central government declined to participate, local governments in the area in which
the mine is located have expressed interest in acquiring shares, as have various Indonesian nationals. The Newmont/Sumitomo partnership continues discussions with various interested parties to meet its divestiture obligations. Under the terms of the
Contract of Work, an additional 7% interest in Batu Hijau must be offered for sale in 2007.

Ahafo Operation

Ahafo commenced commercial production in August 2006 and had gold sales of 202,100 ounces in 2006. Gold production was negatively impacted by nation-wide
power rationing due to low water levels at Lake Volta serving Ghana’s Akosombo hydroelectric facilities, which limited mill availability and throughput.

Costs applicable to sales

in 2006 benefited from the capitalization of
pre-production costs and are expected to be higher in 2007 as a result. The Company is installing additional temporary diesel generating capacity at Ahafo and, along with other Ghanaian mining industry members, is exploring longer-term, lower-cost
solutions to the current power shortages.

Consolidated gold sales for 2007 are expected to increase to approximately 410,000 to 450,000
ounces, as the mine enters its first full year of production. Gold production in 2007 is expected to be lower than previously planned as a result of reduced processing grades and recoveries. Additionally, higher costs and potential production
interruptions could result from possible future power shortages in 2007.

Costs applicable to sales

are expected to increase substantially in 2007 to approximately $460 to $500 per ounce, primarily as a result of lower than previously planned
production and higher power costs. Operating costs are also expected to increase in 2007 as a result of higher anticipated labor and contracted services expenditures, as well as rising fuel and consumables prices.

Other Operations

Ovacik sold in March 2005.

Kori Kollo, Bolivia

.    Gold ounces sold increased in 2006 from 2005, due to a 59% increase in the ore grade of the material
placed on the leach pads, partially offset by 25% fewer tons placed. Total tons mined increased 69%, however, the proportion of waste tons mined increased from 0.11 waste tons per ton of ore in 2005 to 1.50 waste tons per ton of ore in 2006.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased in 2006 from 2005, primarily as a result of the higher waste removal costs.

Gold
ounces sold increased in 2005 from 2004, due to the placement of additional material from the Kori Kollo pit on the existing leach pad and ore from the Kori Chaca pit on a new leach pad beginning in the third



quarter of 2005. The mill was shut down in October 2003, however production continued from residual leaching.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce
decreased from 2004 to 2005 as a result of the increased production.

La Herradura, Mexico

.    Gold ounces sold
decreased in 2006 from 2005 due to the timing of flows from the leach pads. Tons placed on the leach pads increased 21% and was offset by an 18% decrease in ore grade.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased due to expensing all open
pit waste removal costs, an increase in waste tons mined and increased labor, diesel and other commodity prices. In 2005, $3 of mining costs was deferred which reduced

Costs applicable to sales

by $31 per ounce.

Gold ounces sold increased in 2005 from 2004 due to a 12% increase in ore grade and the timing of flows from the leach pads.

Costs applicable to
sales

per ounce increased due to increased labor, diesel and other commodity prices.

Golden Giant,
Canada

.    Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005. Remnant mining and milling production in 2006 was higher than expected due to additional in-circuit inventory recovery and mill clean-up
activities. Remnant production from these activities is expected to be completed in the first half of 2007.

Ovacik,
Turkey

.    On March 1, 2005, the Ovacik mine was sold to a subsidiary of Koza Davetiye, a Turkish conglomerate. Operations were suspended in August 2004 as a result of a court decision ordering suspension of operating
permits pending completion of certain additional permitting requirements and the submission of an updated environmental impact assessment.

Minahasa, Indonesia

.    Mining activities at Minahasa ceased in 2001. Milling of the remaining stockpiles was completed in August 2004. See Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information
regarding legal actions related to Minahasa.

Consolidated gold sales for other operations in 2007 are expected to decrease to
approximately 160,000 to 200,000 ounces at

Costs applicable to sales

of approximately $305 to $325 per ounce as a result of higher stripping expenses and higher anticipated labor and fuel expenses.

Merchant Banking

Merchant
Banking is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Merchant Banking, also referred to as Newmont Capital, manages a royalty portfolio, an equity portfolio, a downstream gold refining business, and engages in value realization
activities (managing interests in oil and gas, iron ore, and coal properties as well as providing in-house investment banking and advisory services).

Merchant Banking manages a royalty portfolio which includes interests that were acquired as a result of the Franco-Nevada acquisition, as well as royalties created by virtue of its land bank activities (through sale
or farm-out). Royalty interests are generally in the form of a net smelter return (“NSR”) royalty that provides for the payment of a specified percentage of production, less certain specified transportation and refining costs. In some
cases, royalties are a net profit interest (“NPI”) entitling Newmont to a specified percentage of the net profits, as defined in each case. The majority of NSR royalty revenue and NPI revenue can be received in cash or in-kind at the
option of Newmont.

Merchant Banking’s royalty interests and equity investments generated $120, $79 and $64 of

Royalty and dividend
income, net

in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase from period-to-period was primarily attributable to steady performance from the gold and platinum group metals royalties coupled with higher gold and oil and gas prices as well as an
increase in distributions received from Canadian Oil Sands Trust.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization

expense related to

Royalty and dividend income, net

was $19, $21 and $24 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.



As of December 31, 2006, Merchant Banking’s equity portfolio had a market value of
approximately $1,354 compared to the 2005 value of approximately $940. The increase is attributable to unrealized gains of approximately $321 during 2006, Merchant Banking purchasing marketable equity securities of Gabriel Resources, reinvesting
dividends from Canadian Oil Sands Trust and closing on a private placement and ore purchase agreement with Queenstake Resources Ltd. for approximately $17, $25 and $10, respectively. During 2005, in addition to unrealized gains of approximately
$343, Merchant Banking purchased marketable equity securities of Shore Gold, Gabriel Resources and Miramar Mining for approximately $87, $31 and $27, respectively and sold Kinross equity securities for approximately $111. Merchant Banking also sold
Oxiana Limited equity securities for $78, of which, the majority were obtained from the sale of Golden Grove. During 2004, in addition to an unrealized gain of approximately $155, Merchant Banking purchased marketable equity securities of Canadian
Oil Sands Trust and Gabriel for approximately $200 and $19, respectively. Also in 2004, Newmont recognized a $39 impairment of its investment in Kinross.

Merchant Banking provides advisory services to Newmont to assist it in managing its portfolio of operating and property interests. During 2006, Merchant Banking completed the acquisition of an additional 22.22%
interest in the Boddington project and the remaining 15% interest in Akyem, bringing the Company’s ownership to 66.67% and 100%, respectively, and the acquisition of a 40% interest in Shore Gold Inc.’s Fort a la Corne diamond Joint Venture
in Saskatchewan, Canada. Merchant Banking completed the sale of the Alberta Oil Sands project, the Martabe project in Indonesia, and the discontinued Holloway operation as discussed above under

Other income, net

and

Loss from discontinued
operations

. Newmont received net cash proceeds of $271 for the Alberta Oil Sands project resulting in a $266 pre-tax gain. Newmont received net cash proceeds of $42 and approximately 43 million Agincourt shares valued at $37 for the Martabe
project, resulting in a $30 pre-tax gain. Newmont received net cash proceeds of $40 plus a royalty for the Holloway operation resulting in a $13 pre-tax gain. In 2005, Merchant Banking provided assistance in the sale of non-core properties including
Golden Grove in Australia, Ovacik in Turkey and Mezcala in Mexico. In 2004, Merchant Banking’s assistance was provided in the sale of non-core properties including Bronzewing in Australia, Perama in Greece and Midwest Uranium in Canada. In
addition, Merchant Banking participated in the restructuring of Australian Magnesium Corporation eliminating all remaining Newmont obligations (see Other Investing Activities below).

Merchant Banking also manages the Company’s interests in downstream gold refining and distribution businesses (40% interest in AGR Matthey Joint
Venture and 50% interest in European Gold Refineries). Merchant Banking earned $4, $4, and $2 in

Equity income of affiliates

through its investments in AGR and EGR in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Other income, net

attributable to the Merchant Banking Segment was as follows:

Exploration

Exploration expense was $170, $147 and $107 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Exploration expense in 2006 reflects higher funding of exploration and
related activities in response to higher gold prices and increased labor and consumable costs. Newmont anticipates it will expense between $170 and $175 on exploration activities in 2007.



During 2006, Newmont replaced approximately 8.9 million equity gold ounces of depletion and
divestitures with 3.7 million equity gold ounces in acquisitions and 5.9 million equity gold ounces of additions and revisions to proven and probable reserves. Exploration activities during 2006 succeeded in converting significant new
reserves at Carlin open pits (2.3 million equity gold ounces), Boddington (1.4 million equity gold ounces), Twin Creeks (1.1 million equity gold ounces), Ahafo (0.7 million equity gold ounces), La Herradura (0.7 million equity gold ounces), and
Kalgoorlie (0.6 million equity gold ounces).

Exploration activities during 2005 primarily focused on the conversion of significant new
reserves at the Carlin open pits (1.9 million equity gold ounces), the Conga district in Peru (1.6 million equity gold ounces), and the two Ghana projects (Ahafo 1.6 million equity gold ounces, Akyem 1.1 million equity gold ounces).
Newmont added a total of 9.4 million equity gold ounces to proven and probable reserves in 2005.

Exploration activities during 2004
primarily focused on the Conga district in Peru and the Phoenix deposit in Nevada. Newmont added 4.5 million equity gold ounces at Conga and 2.3 million equity gold ounces at Phoenix in 2004. Exploration also focused its activities on the
Ghana projects where reserves increased by 3.0 million equity gold ounces at Ahafo and 1.1 million equity gold ounces at Akyem in 2004.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

In addition to its domestic operations in the United States, Newmont has operations
in Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Indonesia, Canada, Bolivia and other foreign locations. The Company’s operations sell their production based on U.S. dollar metal prices.

Fluctuations in local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and

Costs applicable to sales

to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. Such fluctuations have not had a material impact on the Company’s revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. Approximately 33%,
37% and 40% of Newmont’s

Costs applicable to sales

were paid in local currencies in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company’s

Costs applicable to sales

are most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian
dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. However, variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or decreases in costs at
Australian locations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations. No assurance, however, can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate
will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future.

Variations in the local currency exchange rates in
relation to the U.S. dollar at Newmont’s foreign mining operations decreased

Costs applicable to sales

$7 in Australia and increased

Costs applicable to sales

$9 in Indonesia in 2006 from 2005 and increased

Costs applicable to
sales

$15 in 2005 from 2004, primarily in Australia.

Foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar have not had a
material impact on the Company’s determination of proven and probable reserves in the past. However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact the
Company’s cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced as certain proven and probable
reserves may no longer be economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management’s long-term view of the applicable exchange
rate. Future reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily result in reduced gold or copper sales and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization calculated using the units-of-production method and, depending on the level of
reduction, could also result in impairments of property, plant and mine development, mineral interests and/or goodwill.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (“FIN 48”) an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 requires that the Company recognize in its financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely
than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. The provisions of FIN 48 are
effective beginning January 1, 2007 with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, goodwill, deferred income taxes and income taxes payable in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”). FAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions for FAS 157 are effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
January 1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Provided from Operating Activities

Net cash provided from continuing operations

was $1,237, $1,243 and $1,503 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and was significantly impacted by
the following key factors:

(1)

Includes incremental start-up ounces of 100,300 and 22,100 in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

(2)

Before treatment and refining charges.

(3)

Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization.

Net cash provided from continuing operations

remained constant in 2006 compared to 2005. Cash flow from continuing operations during 2006 was
positively impacted by higher realized gold and copper prices, partially offset by fewer gold ounces and copper pounds sold. Also impacting cash flows from operations during 2006 were higher operating costs as noted in

Results of Consolidated
Operations

, a $110 increase in accounts receivable primarily due to trade receivables at Nevada and a $388 increase in inventories, stockpiles and ore on leach pads. Inventories, stockpiles and ore on leach pads increased due to new operations
at Ahafo, Phoenix, and Leeville, increased mining costs, mining rates exceeding processing rates and increased open pit waste removal.

Net cash provided from continuing operations

was also impacted by the physical delivery of 161,111 ounces
of gold under the prepaid forward sales obligation which resulted in the recognition of $48 of non-cash revenue in June 2006. Additionally,

net cash provided by continuing operations

was impacted by the early settlement of the remaining
prepaid forward sales obligation, which resulted in a $40 premium on early extinguishment.

Other.

Cash provided from operating
activities is expected to be negatively impacted in 2007 by the $287 increase in current income and mining taxes payable. Newmont is currently planning to contribute $65 to its

Investing
Activities

Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations

was $838, $1,093 and $1,388 in 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively, primarily due to

Additions to property, plant and mine development,

of $1,551, $1,220 and $674 for continuing operations in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and net proceeds from (investments in) marketable debt and
equity securities of $721, $57 and $(821) in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additionally, approximately $6, $31 and $44 was spent on capital expenditures for the discontinued operations of Golden Grove, Holloway and Zarafshan in 2006, 2005 and

Acquisitions.

In September 2006, Newmont acquired a 40% interest in Shore
Gold Inc.’s Fort a la Corne diamond Joint Venture in Saskatchewan, Canada for $152. The Company believes that this investment represents an opportunity to participate directly in a significant, district-scale diamond development project.

In March 2006, Newmont acquired Newcrest Mining Limited’s 22.22% interest in the Boddington project, bringing its interest in the
project to 66.67%, for total consideration of $173. Development of the Boddington project in Western Australia with AngloGold Ashanti Limited was also announced in the first quarter 2006. Construction of the Boddington project is expected to cost
Newmont approximately $0.9 to $1.0 billion, with initial production expected in late 2008 or early 2009. The project has a current estimated mine life of more than 15 years, with Newmont’s share of annual production expected to be approximately
700,000 ounces for the first five years and average approximately 600,000 ounces over the life of the project.

In January 2006, Newmont
acquired the remaining 15% interest in the Akyem project in Ghana, bringing its interest to 100%. In September 2006, the Company deferred further development of the Akyem project pending completion of permitting, resolution of country-wide power

$3 and assumed all of the reclamation and closure liabilities. Under the agreement, Newmont is entitled to a 1% net smelter return royalty on all future metal production from the property.

During 2004, Newmont entered into an agreement relating to a loan and loan guarantee involving AMC and certain of its subsidiaries. The agreement
resulted in the release of Newmont from its guarantee obligation and the release of all previously accrued and contingent liabilities. This transaction resulted in an $11 gain after providing a A$30 ($23) subordinated loan to a subsidiary of QMC. An
allowance was provided for 100% of the loan receivable. During 2005, the Company reduced the valuation allowance resulting in a gain of $9.

Also impacting cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was the consolidation of Batu Hijau, effective January 1, 2004, which resulted in the recording of approximately $82 of Batu Hijau’s
cash balances.

Project Financing

On June 30, 2006, Newmont Ghana Gold Limited (“NGGL”), a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a $125 project
financing with the International Finance Corporation (“IFC”). The financing is comprised of a $75 A-loan funded by the IFC; and a $50 B-loan funded by a syndicate of commercial lenders. The financing contains certain Conditions
of Disbursement that must be completed prior to funds being made available. NGGL anticipates meeting the Conditions of Disbursement during the first half of 2007. Amounts borrowed under the financing will be collateralized by the assets of
the Ahafo project and will be guaranteed by Newmont pending the successful completion of requirements associated with the Project Financial Completion Certificate (“Project Financial Completion”). The loans will require semi-annual
payments beginning in April 2007. The A-loan has a final maturity of October 2018 and borrowings will be subject to an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.125% pre-completion, and LIBOR plus 2.00% following Project Financial Completion. The B-loan
has a final maturity of October 2017 and borrowings will be subject to an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.80% pre-completion, and LIBOR plus 1.40% post-completion for the first 4-years. The interest rate on the B-loan then increases to LIBOR plus
1.70% (years 5-7); LIBOR plus 1.90% (years 8-9) and LIBOR plus 2.00% (thereafter).

Corporate Revolving Credit Facilities

The Company has an uncollateralized $1,250 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks, which matures in July
2010. The facility contains a letter of credit sub-facility. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company’s senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest at an annual
interest rate of the greater of LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.22% to 1.00%, the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the lead bank’s prime interest rate. Facility fees accrue at an annual rate ranging from 0.080% to 0.250% of the aggregate
commitments. The Company also pays a utilization fee of 0.10% on the amount of revolving credit loans and letters of credit outstanding under the facility for each day on which the sum of such loans and letters of credit exceed 50% of the
commitments under the facility. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the facility fees were 0.09% of the commitment. There was $321 and $275 outstanding under the letter of credit sub-facility as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Debt Covenants

The 5

public debt covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, limitation on sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions.

In addition to the covenants noted above, the corporate revolving credit facility contains financial ratio covenants requiring the Company to maintain a
net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income



taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of less than or equal to 4.0 and a net debt (total debt net of cash, cash equivalents and auction rate
securities) to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5%. Furthermore, the corporate revolving credit facility contains covenants limiting the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, certain change of control
provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets.

Certain of the Company’s project debt facilities contain debt covenants and
default provisions including limitations on dividends subject to certain debt service cover ratios, limitations on sales of assets, negative pledges on certain assets, change of control provisions and limitations of additional permitted debt.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company and its related entities were in compliance with all debt covenants and default provisions.

Shelf Registration Statement

In January 2004, Newmont filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which enables it to issue debt and equity securities from time-to-time having an aggregate offering
price up to $1,000. Newmont also filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-4 which enables it to issue, from time-to-time in connection with acquisitions of businesses, properties or assets, common stock and common stock warrants having an

obligations are reflected here. For more information regarding remediation and reclamation liabilities, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(3)

Contractual obligations for

Employee-related benefits

include severance, workers’
participation, pension funding and other benefit plans. Pension plan funding beyond 2011 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included.

(4)

Purchase obligations are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations
represent contractual obligations for purchase of power, materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects.

(5)

Other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements include labor and service contracts. Payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases as disclosed in the above table and $445 of outstanding letters of credit,
surety bonds and bank guarantees (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). There is also an undrawn contingent sponsor support line of credit to Batu Hijau of $65, of which Newmont’s pro rata share is $37.

Batu Hijau has sales agreements to sell copper concentrates as follows (in millions of pounds) 1,540 in 2007; 1,115 in 2008; 1,411 in 2009; 2,180 in
2010, 1,378 in 2011 and 3,191 thereafter. For information regarding these copper sales agreements, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Hedging, Provisional Copper and Gold Sales, below.

Future Cash Flows

We
anticipate that significant capital expenditures in 2007 through 2009 (see Investing Activities, above), funding of the Exploration and Merchant Banking Segments (see Results of Consolidated Operations, above), debt repayments and dividends to both
common shareholders and minority interests could lead to

Net cash used in investing activities

exceeding

Net cash provided by operating activities

. We expect that any such deficit will be funded through various sources, including

Net cash provided by operating activities

. Newmont believes that financing required to execute all of these investments will be available over the time period required from

Net cash provided by operating activities,

cash, marketable
equity securities or other sources of funds, including the Company’s revolving credit facility, project financing and financing alternatives available in the broader capital markets. For information on the Company’s long-term debt, capital
lease obligations and operating leases, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Subject to any significant adverse changes in the Company’s long-term view of gold and copper prices, the Company has both the ability and intention
to fund from

Net cash provided by operating activities,

the exploration expenditures and investments that were assumed in the goodwill valuations to support the Exploration and Merchant Banking Segments.

Net cash provided from operating activities

in 2007 are expected to be impacted by the $287 increase in current income and mining taxes payable.

Cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the realized spot price of gold and copper. The Company has a series of
price-capped gold sales contracts under which it will realize the lower of the spot price on the delivery date or the capped price. The Company also has copper collar contracts for 102 million pounds under which it will realize a minimum and
maximum price of $1.10 and $1.40 per pound, respectively, in 2007. For information on the sensitivity of Newmont’s

Net cash provided by operating activities

to metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk.

Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S.
dollar, particularly with respect to the Australian dollar. For information concerning the sensitivity of the Company’s

Costs applicable to sales

to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see Results of Consolidated Operations,
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above. For information on the sensitivity of Newmont’s

Net cash provided to operating activities

to foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk.

Based on Newmont’s production profile for the next three years and proven and probable reserves as of December 31, 2006,
without considering future additions to such reserves, Newmont expects that consolidated gold ounces sold will be between 6.1 and 6.6 million ounces in 2007. The Company does not anticipate that reasonably expected variations in gold or copper
sales alone will influence its ability to pay its debt and other obligations over that period.



Environmental

The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state
laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment
and believes its operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full
amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, $520 and $428, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to
currently producing mineral properties, of which $67 is classified as current liabilities expected to be spent in 2007.

In addition, the
Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. The Company believes
that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the compliance required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon the
Company’s best estimate of its liability for these matters, $85 and $77 were accrued for such obligations as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, the Company believes that it
is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 89% greater or 27% lower than the amount accrued as of December 31, 2006. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and
circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are charged to

Other expense, net

in the period estimates are revised.

Newmont spent $12, $14 and $20 in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, for environmental obligations related to former, primarily historic, mining activities, and has classified $10 as a current liability expected to be spent in 2007.
Expenditures for 2006, 2005 and 2004 related primarily to legacy Normandy properties in Australia, the McCoy/Cove property in Nevada and the Dawn mill site near Ford, Washington.

Included in capital expenditures were $124, $35 and $43 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. Ongoing costs to
comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of

Costs applicable to sales

.

For more information on
the Company’s reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Forward-Looking Statements

The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained
elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are
intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. See the discussion in Forward-Looking Statements in Item 1, Business.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Metal Price

Changes in the market price of gold and copper significantly affect Newmont’s profitability
and cash flow. Gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; the strength of the U.S. dollar and global mine production levels.
Copper is traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates.



Foreign Currency

Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar may affect
Newmont’s profitability and cash flow. Foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and U.S. currencies and U.S. and foreign country economic conditions. In addition to its
operations in the United States, Newmont has operations in Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Canada, Bolivia, New Zealand and Mexico. The Company’s non-U.S. operations sell their metal production based on a U.S. dollar gold price. Fluctuations in the
local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and total cash costs per ounce to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. Since the Company’s February 15, 2002
acquisition of Normandy, the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate has had the greatest impact on the Company’s total cash costs, as measured in U.S. dollars. However, variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate have
historically been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or decreases in costs at Australian gold operations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in
sales reported in U.S. dollars for such locations. No assurance can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future, or that short-term changes in the
Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will not have an impact on the Company’s profitability and cash flow. Foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar have not had a material impact on Newmont’s determination of
proven and probable reserves in the past. However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact the Company’s cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting
increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, profitability, cash flows and the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a
variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management’s long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. For information concerning the sensitivity of the Company’s cash costs to changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition-Results of Consolidated Operations-Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above.

Hedging

Newmont generally avoids hedging its gold production. Newmont’s philosophy is to provide
shareholders with leverage to gold prices by selling its gold production at market prices. Newmont has entered into derivative contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated gold and copper production and to manage risks associated
with sales contracts, commodities, interest rates, and foreign currency. Newmont is not required to place collateral with respect to derivative contracts and there are no margin calls associated with such contracts. During 2005 and 2006, Newmont
entered into copper option collar contracts and $/IDR forward purchase contracts. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 13 million pounds of copper are hedged by the copper option collar contracts, which have been designated as cash flow
hedges of forecasted copper sales, and as such, changes in the fair value related to the effective portion of the hedges have been recorded in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 89 million
pounds of copper option collar contracts are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis currently through earnings. The $/IDR forward purchase contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of future IDR expenditures, and as such, changes in the
market value have been recorded in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

.



For 2006, 2005 and 2004, net losses of ($60) and net gains of $2 and $2, respectively, were included in

Other income, net

for the ineffective portion of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges. The amount to be reclassified from

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

,

net of tax

to income for derivative
instruments during the next 12 months is a loss of approximately $1. The maximum period over which hedged forecasted transactions are expected to occur is 5 years.

(1)

56.25% guaranteed by Newmont, 43.75% guaranteed by an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation.

(2)

The fair value does not include amounts payable ($24) on derivative contracts that have been closed out
in December 2006 with the net settlement due and paid in January 2007.

(3)

The fair value does not include amounts payable ($36) on derivative contracts that had been closed out
in December 2005 with the net settlement due and paid in January 2006.

Provisional Copper and Gold Sales

The Company’s sales based on a provisional sales price contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from
the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward London Metal Exchange price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is
marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, the Company had embedded copper derivatives on 180 million pounds and 223 million pounds, recorded at an average
price of $2.87 and $2.01 per pound, respectively.

For 2006 and 2005, Batu Hijau recorded the following gross revenues before treatment and
refining charges, which were subject to final price adjustments as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, as follows:

The average final price adjustments realized were as follows:



Price-Capped Forward Sales Contracts

In 2001, Newmont entered into transactions that closed out certain call options. The options were replaced with a series of forward sales contracts
requiring physical delivery of the same quantity of gold over slightly extended future periods. Under the terms of the contracts, Newmont will realize the lower of the spot price on the delivery date or the capped price ranging from $381 to $392 per
ounce. The initial fair value of the forward sales contracts was recorded as deferred revenue. As of December 31, 2006, $47 remained in deferred revenue and will be included in revenue as delivery occurs. The forward sales contracts are
accounted for as normal sales contracts under FAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and FAS No. 138 “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities-an
Amendment to FAS No. 133.”

Newmont had the following price-capped forward sales contracts outstanding as of December 31,
2006:

Interest Rate Swap Contracts

In 2001, Newmont entered into contracts to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk exposure on a
portion of its $275 8


/


% debentures expiring in 2011 and its $200 8


/


% debentures which expired in 2005. Under the $275 8


/


% debentures hedge contract terms, the Company receives fixed-rate interest payments at 8.625% and pays floating-rate interest amounts based on periodic
London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) settings plus a spread, ranging from 2.60% to 3.49%. Prior to expiration of the $200 8


/


% debentures and the associated hedge contracts, Newmont received fixed-rate interest payments of 8.375% and paid floating-rate interest amounts based on periodic LIBOR settings plus a spread, ranging
from 3.41% to 4.25%. These transactions resulted in a reduction in interest expense of $nil, $3 and $6 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The remaining swap contracts are designated as a hedge against $100
principal of the 8


/


% debentures. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was $1 and $2 as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Fixed and Variable Rate Debt

Newmont has both fixed and variable rate debt. 74% and 78% of debt was fixed and
26% and 22% was variable as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company has managed some of its fixed rate debt exposure by entering into interest rate swaps (see Interest Rate Swap Contracts above). The Company’s fixed rate
debt exposure as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 is summarized as follows:

estimated fair value quoted above may or may not reflect the actual trading value of these instruments.

The pro forma information assumes a +/–10 basis point change in market interest rates as of
December 31 of each year, and reflects the corresponding estimated change in the fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption. Actual changes in the timing and amount of interest rate variations may differ from
the above assumptions.



Pension and Other Benefit Plans

As of December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB
Statement No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (“FAS 158”). FAS 158 required employers that
sponsor one or more defined benefit plans to (i) recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in its statement of financial position, (ii) recognize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period as a
component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, (iii) measure the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end statement of financial position, and (iv) disclose in the notes to the
financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. The
impact of adopting FAS 158 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows:

The effect of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003,
prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D, decreased post-retirement project benefit obligations by $8 in 2006.

Yield curves
matching our benefit obligations were derived using a cash flow analysis under the Citigroup pension discount curve. The Citigroup pension discount curve shows the relationship between interest rates and duration for hypothetical zero coupon
investments. Under this approach, Treasury par curve data is used to set the shape of the yield curve and calculate the AA corporate spot yield at each maturity. The resulting curve was used to identify a discount rate for the Company of 5.9% and
5.75% in 2006 and 2005, respectively, based on the timing of future benefit payments. The decision to use 8% as the expected long-term return on plan assets was made based on an analysis of the actual plan asset returns over multiple time horizons
and review of assumptions used by other U.S. corporations with defined benefit plans of similar size and investment strategy. The average actual return on plan assets during the 18 years ended December 31, 2006 approximated 10%.

Pension and other benefit plan

costs can be impacted by actual results that differ from assumptions selected. These differences are reflected in
financial results over future periods. Actual returns on pension assets were $28, $18 and $19 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, compared to expected returns of $32, $21 and $14 for the same periods. If the difference between expected returns and
actual results related to plan assets, combined with the gains or losses resulting from the projected benefit obligation, fall outside certain limits, the difference will be amortized into future earnings on a straight-line basis over the average
remaining working life of the participants (currently 13.1 years). The following table provides details of the pension plans asset mix as of December 31, 2006:



The pension plan employs several independent investment firms which invest the assets of the plan in
certain approved funds that correspond to specific asset classes with associated target allocations. Depending upon actual sector performance, the assets in the plan are periodically rebalanced to match the established target levels for the asset
classes. This rebalancing may be accomplished through actual transfer of funds between asset classes and managers, or through targeted cash contributions and/or distributions. The goal of the pension fund investment program is to achieve expected
rates of return consistent with the investment risk associated with the approved investment portfolio. The investment performance of the plan and that of the individual investment firms is measured against recognized market indices. This performance
is monitored by an investment committee comprised of members of the Company’s management, which in turn, is advised by an independent investment consultant. The performance of the plan is reviewed annually with the Audit Committee of the
Company’s board of directors.

Contributions to the pension plans were $23, $12 and $38 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
Company is currently planning to contribute $65, to its retirement benefit programs in 2007.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 defines internal control over financial reporting in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s
principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

.

Based upon its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based upon those criteria.

Management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears
herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Newmont Mining Corporation:

We have completed integrated audits of Newmont Mining Corporation's 2006, 2005 and 2004
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its methods of accounting for share-based payments, stripping costs
incurred during the production phase and defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans all effective January 1, 2006; and changed its method of accounting for an investment following the adoption of FIN-46R effective January 1,
2004.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under
Item 8, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in



accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 1    THE COMPANY

Newmont Mining Corporation and its affiliates and
subsidiaries (collectively, “Newmont” or the “Company”) predominantly operate in a single industry, namely, exploration for and production of gold.

The Company’s sales result from operations in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, Bolivia, New Zealand and Mexico. The cash flow and profitability of the Company’s operations are
significantly affected by the market price of gold, and to a lesser extent, copper. The prices of gold and copper can fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the Company’s control.

References to “A$” refers to Australian currency, “CDN$” to Canadian currency, “IDR” to Indonesian currency, and
“$” to United States currency.

NOTE 2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of Estimates

The Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Company to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates utilized in impairment calculations and units-of-production
depreciation, depletion and amortization calculations; environmental, reclamation and closure obligations; estimates of recoverable gold and other minerals in stockpile and leach pad inventories; estimates of fair value for certain reporting units
and asset impairments (including impairments of goodwill, long-lived assets and investments); write-downs of inventory to net realizable value; post employment, post retirement and other employee benefit liabilities; valuation allowances for
deferred tax assets; reserves for contingencies and litigation; and the fair value and accounting treatment of financial instruments. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Newmont Mining Corporation and
more-than-50%-owned subsidiaries that it controls and entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights (see Note 3). The Company also includes its pro-rata share of assets, liabilities and operations for unincorporated
joint ventures in which it has an interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The functional currency for the majority of the Company’s operations, including the Australian operations, is the U.S.
dollar. The functional currency of the Canadian operations is the Canadian dollar.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Because of the
short maturity of these investments, the carrying amounts approximate their fair value. Cash and cash equivalents are invested in United States Treasury bills and high-quality commercial paper. Restricted cash is excluded from cash and cash
equivalents and is included in other current and long-term assets.

millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Investments

Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each reporting date. Investments in incorporated entities in
which the Company’s ownership is greater than 20% and less than 50%, or which the Company does not control through majority ownership or means other than voting rights, are accounted for by the equity method and are included in long-term
assets. The Company periodically reviews and accounts for its equity security investments as available for sale securities in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“FAS”) No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” Additional information concerning the Company’s equity method and security investments is included in Note 14.

The Company accounts for its investments in auction rate securities in accordance with FAS No. 115. Specifically, when the underlying security
of an auction rate security has a stated or contractual maturity date in excess of 90 days, regardless of the frequency of the interest rate reset date, the security is classified as an available-for-sale marketable debt security.

Stockpiles, Ore on Leach Pads and Inventories

As
described below, costs that are incurred in or benefit the productive process are accumulated as stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories. Stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable
value. Net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price of the product based on current and long-term metals prices, less the estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. Write-downs of stockpiles, ore on
leach pads and inventories, resulting from net realizable value impairments, are reported as a component of

Costs applicable to sales

. The current portion of stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories is determined based on the expected
amounts to be processed within the next 12 months. Stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories not expected to be processed within the next 12 months are classified as long-term. The major classifications are as follows:

Stockpiles

Stockpiles
represent ore that has been mined and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data) and the
estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated to stockpiles based on relative values of material stockpiled and processed using current
mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable overhead, depreciation, depletion and amortization relating to mining operations, and removed at each stockpile’s average cost per recoverable unit.

Ore on Leach Pads

The
recovery of gold from certain gold oxide ores is achieved through the heap leaching process. Under this method, oxide ore is placed on leach pads where it is treated with a chemical solution, which dissolves the gold contained in the ore. The
resulting “pregnant” solution is further processed in a plant where the gold is recovered. Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable depreciation, depletion and amortization relating to mining
operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad.

(dollars in
millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

The estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed
on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover approximately 50% to 95% of the recoverable
ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete.

Although the quantities of
recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to
precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, the Company’s operating results have not been materially
impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of gold on its leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net
realizable value are accounted for on a prospective basis.

In-process Inventory

In-process inventories represent materials that are currently in the process of being converted to a saleable product. Conversion processes vary depending
on the nature of the ore and the specific processing facility, but include mill in-circuit, leach in-circuit, flotation and column cells, and carbon in-pulp inventories. In-process material is measured based on assays of the material fed into the
process and the projected recoveries of the respective plants. In-process inventories are valued at the average cost of the material fed into the process attributable to the source material coming from the mines, stockpiles and/or leach pads plus
the in-process conversion costs, including applicable depreciation relating to the process facilities incurred to that point in the process.

Precious Metals Inventory

Precious metals inventories include gold doré and/or gold bullion. Precious metals
that are received as in-kind payments of royalties are valued at fair value on the date title is transferred to the Company. Precious metals that result from the Company’s mining and processing activities are valued at the average cost of the
respective in-process inventories incurred prior to the refining process, plus applicable refining costs.

Concentrate Inventory

Concentrate inventories represent copper and gold concentrate available for shipment. The Company values concentrate inventory at
the average cost, including an allocable portion of mill support costs and mill depreciation. Costs are added and removed to the concentrate inventory based on tons of concentrate and are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.

Materials and Supplies

Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Cost includes applicable taxes and freight.

Property, Plant and Mine Development

Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and
depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated productive lives, which do not exceed the related estimated mine lives, of such facilities based on proven and probable reserves.

Mineral exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of
establishing proven and probable reserves, costs incurred prospectively to develop the property are capitalized as incurred and are amortized using the units-of-production (“UOP”) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on
estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves. At the Company’s surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At the Company’s
underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development.

Major development costs incurred after the commencement of production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces or pounds
in proven and probable reserves. To the extent that these costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated life of the ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of
that area are amortized over the estimated life of that specific ore block or area.

Interest cost allocable to the cost of developing
mining properties and to constructing new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use.

Mineral Interests

Mineral interests include acquired mineral and royalty interests in production, development and exploration stage properties. The
amount capitalized related to a mineral or royalty interest represents its fair value at the time it was acquired, either as an individual asset purchase or as a part of a business combination.

The value of such assets is primarily driven by the nature and amount of mineralized material believed to be contained in such properties. Production
stage mineral interests represent interests in operating properties that contain proven and probable reserves. Development stage mineral interests represent interests in properties under development that contain proven and probable reserves.
Exploration stage mineral interests represent interests in properties that are believed to potentially contain mineralized material consisting of (i) other mineralized material such as inferred material within pits; measured, indicated and
inferred material with insufficient drill spacing to qualify as proven and probable reserves; and inferred material in close proximity to proven and probable reserves; (ii) around-mine exploration potential such as inferred material not
immediately adjacent to existing reserves and mineralization but located within the immediate mine area; (iii) other mine-related exploration potential that is not part of measured, indicated or inferred material and is comprised mainly of
material outside of the immediate mine area; or (iv) greenfields exploration potential that is not associated with any other production, development or exploration stage property, as described above. The Company’s mineral rights generally
are enforceable regardless of whether proven and probable reserves have been established. In certain limited situations, the nature of a mineral right changes from an exploration right to a mining right upon the establishment of proven and probable
reserves. The Company has the ability and intent to renew mineral interests where the existing term is not sufficient to recover all identified and valued proven and probable reserves and/or undeveloped mineralized material.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(dollars in
millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Royalty interests are generally in the form of a net smelter return (“NSR”) royalty, which
provides for the payment either in cash or physical metal (“in-kind”) of a specified percentage of production less certain specified transportation and refining costs. Net profit interests (“NPI”) are those pursuant to which
Newmont is entitled to a specified percentage of the net profits, as defined in each case. The majority of NSR royalty revenue and NPI revenue can be received in-kind (generally in the form of gold bullion) at the option of Newmont. As detailed
further in Note 17, the Company owns royalty interests in production, development and exploration stage properties.

Asset Impairment

Long-lived Assets

The Company
reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an
undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on quantities of
recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production levels and operating costs of production and capital, all based on life-of-mine plans. Existing
proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are included when
determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The term “recoverable minerals” refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will
be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management’s relative confidence in such materials. In
estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. The Company’s estimates of future cash flows are based
on numerous assumptions and it is possible that actual future cash flows will be significantly different than the estimates, as actual future quantities of recoverable minerals, gold and other commodity prices, production levels and operating costs
of production and capital are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties.

Goodwill

The Company evaluates, on at least an annual basis, the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether current events and circumstances indicate that
such carrying amount may no longer be recoverable. To accomplish this, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to their carrying amounts. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the
Company compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying amount, and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value is charged to earnings. The Company’s fair value estimates are based on numerous
assumptions and it is possible that actual fair value will be significantly different than the estimates, as actual future quantities of recoverable minerals, gold and other commodity prices, production levels and operating costs of production and
capital are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized, net of treatment and refining charges, from a sale when the price is determinable, the product has been delivered, the title has
been transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(dollars in
millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

reasonably assured. Revenues from by-product sales are credited to

Costs applicable to sales

as a by-product credit. Royalty revenue received in-kind
(generally in the form of gold bullion) is recognized based on the fair value on the date that title is transferred to the Company.

Concentrate sales are initially recorded based on 100% of the provisional sales prices. Until final settlement occurs, adjustments to the provisional sales prices are made to take into account the mark-to-market changes based on the forward
prices for the estimated month of settlement. For changes in metal quantities upon receipt of new information and assay, the provisional sales quantities are adjusted as well. The principal risks associated with recognition of sales on a provisional
basis include metal price fluctuations between the date initially recorded and the date of final settlement. If a significant decline in metal prices occurs between the provisional pricing date and the final settlement-date, it is reasonably
possible that the Company could be required to return a portion of the sales proceeds received based on the provisional invoice.

The
Company’s sales based on a provisional sales price contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the
forward London Metal Exchange price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement.

Stripping Costs

Stripping costs incurred during the
production phase of a mine are variable production costs that are included as a component of inventory to be recognized in

Costs applicable to sales

in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory. Capitalization of
post-production stripping costs is appropriate only to the extent product inventory exists at the end of a reporting period.

Prior to 2006
(see Note 3) at some of the Company’s mining operations, deferred stripping costs were charged to

Costs applicable to sales

as gold or copper was produced and sold using the units of production method based on estimated recoverable
quantities of proven and probable gold or copper reserves, using a stripping ratio calculated as the ratio of total tons to be moved to total proven and probable ore reserves, which resulted in the recognition of the costs of waste removal
activities over the life of the mine as gold or copper was produced. The application of the deferred stripping accounting method generally resulted in an asset (deferred stripping costs), although a liability (advanced stripping costs) arose when
the actual stripping ratio incurred to date was less than the expected stripping ratio over the life of the mine. The

Advanced stripping costs

primarily pertained to the Batu Hijau operation.

Reclamation and Remediation Costs (Asset Retirement Obligations)

Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the
estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and abandonment costs. The asset retirement obligation is based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance and activity to date will occur. The Company reviews, on an
annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary, the asset retirement obligation at each mine site in accordance with FASB FAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.”

Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on management’s best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be
incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised.

Income and Mining Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of the Company’s liabilities and assets and the related income tax
basis for such liabilities and assets. This method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for the Company, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect. The Company derives its deferred income tax charge or benefit by
recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year. Mining taxes represent Canadian provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes; as such taxes are based on a
percentage of mining profits. With respect to the earnings that the Company derives from the operations of its consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the earnings are indefinitely reinvested, no deferred taxes have been provided on the
unremitted earnings (including the excess of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of such equity) of these consolidated companies.

The Company’s deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. The Company records a valuation allowance against any portion of those
deferred income tax assets when it believes, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency for the
majority of the Company’s operations, including the Australian operations, is the U.S. dollar. All monetary assets and liabilities where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are translated at current exchange rates and the resulting
adjustments are included in

Other income, net

. The functional currency of the Canadian operations is the Canadian dollar. All monetary assets and liabilities recorded in functional currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated at current
exchange rates and the resulting adjustments are charged or credited directly to

Accumulated other comprehensive income

(“OCI”) in

Stockholders’ equity.

Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies are translated at the
weighted-average exchange rates for the period.

Sales Contracts, Commodity and Derivative Instruments

Derivative contracts qualifying as normal purchases and sales are accounted for under deferral accounting. Gains and losses arising from a change in the
fair value of a contract before the contract’s designated delivery date are not recorded and the contract price is recognized in

Sales—gold, net

following settlement of the contract by physical delivery of production to the
counterparty at contract maturity.

The fair value of derivative contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges are reflected as assets or
liabilities in the balance sheet. To the extent these hedges are effective in offsetting forecasted cash flows from the sale of production or production costs (the “effective portion”), changes in fair value are deferred in OCI. Amounts
deferred in OCI are reclassified to

Sales, net

or to

Costs applicable to sales

, as applicable, when the hedged transaction has occurred. The ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in

Other

in each period.

When derivative contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges are settled, accelerated or restructured before
the maturity date of the contracts, the accumulated OCI at the settlement date is deferred and reclassified to

Sales—gold, net

when the originally designated hedged transaction occurs.

The fair values of derivative contracts qualifying as fair value hedges are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. Changes in fair

rate swaps utilized by the Company to swap a portion of its fixed rate interest rate risk to floating rate risk are recognized as a component of

Stock Based Compensation

Compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes: a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in
accordance with the original provisions of FAS 123, and b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123(R).

Prior to 2006, the Company accounted for share-based payments under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related Interpretations, as permitted by FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

. In accordance with APB 25, no compensation cost was required to be recognized
for options granted that had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

Net Income per Common
Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share are presented for

Net income

and for

Income from continuing operations

. Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing

Net income

or

Income from continuing operations

by the weighted-average number of outstanding common shares for the period, including the exchangeable shares (see Note 10). Diluted earnings
per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts that may require the issuance of common shares in the future were converted. Diluted earnings per share is computed by increasing the weighted-average number
of outstanding common shares to include the additional common shares that would be outstanding after conversion and adjusting net income for changes that would result from the conversion. Only those securities or other contracts that result in a
reduction in earnings per share are included in the calculation.

Comprehensive Income

In addition to

Net income, Comprehensive income

includes all changes in equity during a period, such as adjustments to minimum pension liabilities,
foreign currency translation adjustments, the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and cumulative unrecognized changes in fair value of marketable securities available-for-sale or
other investments, except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2006 presentation. The most significant reclassifications were to reclassify the

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Income Taxes

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (“FIN 48”) an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 requires that the Company recognize in its financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being
sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective beginning
January 1, 2007 with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, goodwill, deferred income taxes and income taxes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and disclosures.

Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157,
“Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The
provisions of FAS 157 are effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 3    ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Pensions

As of
December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
132(R)” (“FAS 158”). FAS 158 required employers that sponsor one or more defined benefit plans to (i) recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in its statement of financial position, (ii) recognize the gains or losses
and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, (iii) measure the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end
statement of financial position, and (iv) disclose in the notes to the financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses,
prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. The impact of adopting FAS 158 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows:



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

Stock Based Compensation

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R), “

Share-Based
Paymen

t” (“FAS 123(R)”). The Company adopted FAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. Under this method, compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes: a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted
prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of FAS 123, and b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1,
2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123(R).

As a result of adopting FAS 123(R),
the Company’s

Income from continuing operations

and

Net income

for 2006 is $19 ($0.04 per share) lower, than if we had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB 25 as we did in the comparable prior year periods.
Prior to the adoption of FAS 123(R), cash retained as a result of tax deductions relating to stock-based compensation was included in operating cash flows, along with other tax cash flows. FAS 123(R) requires tax benefits relating to the
deductibility of increases in the equity instruments issued under share-based compensation arrangements that are not included in Costs applicable to sales (“excess tax benefits”) to be presented in the

Statement of Cash Flows

as financing cash inflows. The benefit realized for tax deductions from option exercises totaled $3 in 2006.

Deferred Stripping
Costs

On January 1, 2006 the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-06 (“EITF 04-06”),
“Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry.” EITF 04-06 addresses the accounting for stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine and refers to these costs as variable production
costs that should be included as a component of inventory to be recognized in

Costs applicable to sales

in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory. As a result, capitalization of post-production stripping costs is
appropriate only to the extent product inventory exists at the end of a reporting period. The guidance required the recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption, with no charge to earnings in
the period of adoption for prior periods. The cumulative effect adjustment reduced retained earnings by $81 (net of tax and minority interests) and eliminated the $71 net deferred stripping asset from the balance sheet. Adoption of EITF 04-06 had no
impact on the Company’s cash position or net cash from operations.

Prior to 2006 at some of the Company’s mining operations,
deferred stripping costs were charged to

Costs applicable to sales

as gold or copper was produced and sold using the units of production method based on estimated recoverable quantities of proven and probable gold or copper reserves, using a
stripping ratio calculated as the ratio of total tons to be moved to total proven and probable ore reserves, which resulted in the recognition of the costs of waste removal activities over the life of the mine as gold or copper was produced. The
application of the deferred stripping accounting method generally resulted in an asset (deferred stripping costs), although a liability (advanced stripping costs) arose when the actual stripping ratio incurred to date was less than the expected
stripping ratio over the life of the mine. The

Advanced stripping costs

primarily pertained to the Batu Hijau operation.

Consolidation of Batu Hijau

In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46R (“FIN 46R”), which provides guidance on the identification and reporting for
entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. FIN 46R defines such entities as variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Newmont identified the Nusa Tenggara Partnership (“NTP”) and P.T. Newmont Nusa
Tenggara (“PTNNT”) (collectively, “Batu Hijau”) as VIEs. Therefore, as of January 1, 2004, the Company has fully consolidated Batu Hijau in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Under the Batu Hijau Contract of Work, a portion of the project must be offered for sale to the Indonesian government or to Indonesian nationals.
Therefore, it is possible that future changes in the Company’s economic ownership interest in Batu Hijau would result in the Company accounting for its investment in Batu Hijau using the equity method of accounting, significantly impacting the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In this case, Batu Hijau revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, minority interests and cash flows would no longer be individually reported in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company’s share of Batu Hijau net income would be reported as

Equity income of affiliates

Upon consolidation of Batu Hijau, effective January 1, 2004, certain adjustments were recorded
to the opening balance sheet of PTNNT to conform to Newmont’s accounting policies. These adjustments were recorded to change from units-of-production depreciation of processing plant and mining facilities to straight-line depreciation of such
facilities and to change from allocating costs to stockpile inventories based on mining costs per ton to allocating costs based on recoverable pounds of copper equivalent contained in the various categories of stockpiles. The impact of these
adjustments was a charge of $47, net of income tax expense and minority interest which has been recorded in

Newmont intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from certain foreign operations. Accordingly,
U.S. and non-U.S. income and withholding taxes for which deferred taxes might otherwise be required, have not been provided on a cumulative amount of temporary differences (including, for this purpose, any difference between the tax basis in the
stock of a consolidated subsidiary and the amount of the subsidiary’s net equity determined for financial reporting purposes) related to investments in foreign subsidiaries of approximately $844 and $1,013 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The additional U.S. and non-U.S. income and withholding tax that would arise on the reversal of the temporary differences could be offset in part, by tax credits. Because the determination of the amount of available tax credits and the
limitations imposed on the annual utilization of such credits are subject to a highly complex series of calculations and expense allocations, it is impractical to estimate the amount of net income and withholding tax that might be payable if a
reversal of temporary differences occurred.

As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the Company had (i) $830 and
$949 of net operating loss carry forwards, respectively; and (ii) $155 and $155 of tax credit carry forwards, respectively. Of the amounts of net operating loss carry forwards, $47 and $74, respectively, are attributable to acquired mining
operations conducted in the United States and will begin expiring in 2013 if not utilized before then. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, $509 and $618, respectively, of net operating loss carry forwards are attributable to acquired mining
operations in Australia for which current tax law provides no expiration period. The remaining net operating losses available are attributable to acquired entities and have various temporal and other limitations that may restrict the ultimate
realization of the tax benefits of such tax attributes.

Tax credit carry forwards for 2006 and 2005 of $135 and $147 consist of foreign
tax credits available in the United States; substantially all such credits not utilized will expire at the end of 2011. Other credit carry forwards at the end of 2006 and 2005 in the amounts of $20 and $8, respectively, represent alternative minimum
tax credits attributable to the Company’s U.S. operations for which the current tax law provides no period of expiration.

During 2006 the Company completed a reconciliation of its U.S. book and tax basis assets and
liabilities as well as a detailed analysis of its income taxes payable. This exercise identified differences of $27. The entire adjustment was recognized as a tax benefit in 2006. The Company also recognized a net tax benefit of $16 due to an
adjustment on the interest accrued on tax contingencies.

The Company decreased the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets by
$27 during 2006. The decrease resulted partially from the utilization of capital losses in Australia from capital gain transactions occurring in the current year. Previously, the Company had placed a full valuation allowance on these capital losses
because of a lack of sufficient positive evidence to support the future realization of these deferred tax assets. The remaining net decrease in valuation allowance is primarily attributable to increased expected realization of foreign tax credits
reduced by an increase in the valuation allowance recorded due to the lack of sufficient positive evidence concerning the ability of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the tax loss carryforwards. The
valuation allowance remaining at the end of 2006 primarily is attributable to non-U.S. subsidiaries tax loss carryforwards. Of the total $517 and $523 valuation allowance recorded as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, $78 in 2006 and $89 in 2005
are attributable to deferred tax assets for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will be allocated to reduce goodwill related to prior acquisitions.

The breakdown of the Company’s net deferred tax assets between the United States and foreign taxing jurisdictions is as follows:

In December, the Company entered into an in-principle Heads of Agreement (“HOA”) with
the Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”). The HOA specifies the terms of a proposed settlement of the outstanding audit issues relating to Normandy Mining Limited (“Normandy”, now known as Newmont Australia Limited) for the tax
years 1994-1999. These issues relate to years before the Company acquired Normandy. At the date of the business combination, Normandy had recorded no income tax liability with respect to the tax positions taken in reporting certain transactions,
therefore the Company’s initial best estimate of the FAS 5 income tax contingency relating to these issues was recorded as a tax liability at the date of acquisition, February 15, 2002, by increasing the purchase price of Normandy. As of
December 31, 2006, the long-term income tax liability balance relating to this proposed settlement was reclassified to current income taxes payable.

The breakdown of the Company’s income and mining taxes between the United States and foreign taxing jurisdictions is as follows:

NOTE 9    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE

In
July 2006, Newmont’s Board of Directors approved a plan to sell the Company’s 50% interest in the Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture. However, as a result of the Uzbekistan government’s expropriation of the Company’s assets in
August 2006, a pre-tax impairment loss of $101 was recognized in the third quarter of 2006. The Company will continue to challenge the Uzbekistan government’s actions through international arbitration.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, Newmont committed to plans to divest Holloway. In September 2006, Newmont reached an agreement with St. Andrew
Goldfields Ltd. to sell Holloway for cash proceeds of $40 plus certain royalties. The sale was completed in November 2006, resulting in a $13 pre-tax gain.

In 2005, Newmont sold Golden Grove in Western Australia to Oxiana Limited (“Oxiana”) for cash of $147 and 82 million Oxiana shares, resulting in a $6 pre-tax gain.

100%.

NOTE 13    SALES CONTRACTS, COMMODITY AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Newmont generally avoids gold hedging. Newmont’s philosophy is to provide shareholders with leverage to gold prices by selling its gold production at
market prices. Newmont has entered into derivative contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated gold and copper production and to manage risks associated with sales contracts, commodities, interest rates, and foreign currency.
Newmont is not required to place collateral with respect to commodity instruments and there are no margin calls associated with such contracts. During 2005 and 2006, Newmont entered into copper option collar contracts and $/IDR forward purchase
contracts. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 13 million pounds of copper are hedged by the copper option collar contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted copper sales, and as such, changes in the fair
value related to the effective portion of the hedges have been recorded in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

Provisional Copper and Gold Sales

The Company’s sales based on a provisional sales price contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from
the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward London Metal Exchange price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is
marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, the Company had consolidated embedded copper derivatives on 180 million pounds and 223 million pounds, recorded
at an average price of $2.87 and $2.01 per pound, respectively.

For 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded the following gross revenues
before treatment and refining charges, which were subject to final price adjustments as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, as follows:

The average final price adjustments realized were as follows:

Price-Capped Forward Sales Contracts

In 2001, Newmont entered into transactions that closed out certain call options. The options were replaced with a series of forward sales contracts
requiring physical delivery of the same quantity of gold over slightly extended future periods. Under the terms of the contracts, Newmont will realize the lower of the spot price on the delivery date or the capped price ranging from $381 to $392 per
ounce. The initial fair value of the forward sales contracts was recorded as deferred revenue. As of December 31, 2006, $47 remained in deferred revenue and will be included in revenue as delivery occurs. The forward sales contracts are
accounted for as normal sales contracts under FAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and FAS No. 138 “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities-an
Amendment to FAS No. 133.”

Newmont had the following price-capped forward sales contracts outstanding as of December 31,
2006:

Interest Rate Swap Contracts

debentures and the associated hedge contracts, Newmont received fixed-rate interest payments of 8.375% and paid floating-rate interest amounts based on periodic LIBOR settings plus a spread, ranging from 3.41% to 4.25%. These transactions resulted
in a reduction in interest expense of $nil, $3 and $6 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was $1 and $2 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The unrealized loss of $4 in 2006 is primarily related to the Company’s investments in two
long-term marketable equity securities. While the fair value of both of these investments has fallen below their respective cost, the Company views these declines as temporary. The Company’s policy is to treat a decline in the investment’s
quoted market value that has lasted continuously for more than six months as an other-than-temporary decline in value, and the fair values of these investments have not been continuously below cost for the past six months. The Company continues to
monitor these investments.

Marketable Securities of Oxiana Limited

In the first quarter of 2005, Newmont sold approximately 10 million shares of Oxiana Limited (“Oxiana”) and recognized a pre-tax gain of
$6. In the third quarter of 2005, Newmont received approximately 82 million shares of Oxiana (with a fair value of $61), as part of the proceeds for the sale of Golden Grove (see Note 9). These shares were sold in the fourth quarter of 2005 for
a gain of $19.

Marketable Securities of Kinross Gold Corporation

In June 2004, Newmont recognized a $39 impairment of its investment in Kinross Gold Corporation (“Kinross”) for an other-than-temporary decline in value in accordance with FAS No. 115, “Accounting

In 2006, the Company reached an agreement in principle to settle certain pre-existing tax
contingencies established as part of the purchase price allocation related to the acquisition of Normandy (see Note 29). Accordingly, Merchant Banking goodwill was adjusted.

In 2005, annual testing for impairment pursuant to FAS No. 142 (comparison of implied goodwill value to carrying value) resulted in an impairment
charge against goodwill for the Nevada Segment of $41. The impairment resulted from a reevaluation of future production and operating costs that indicated higher future operating and capital costs. The Company also adjusted the tax basis of certain
assets originally recorded as part of the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of Normandy. The adjustment to goodwill in the Merchant Banking Segment reflects the resolution of certain tax contingencies established as part of the purchase
price allocation relating to the acquisition of Franco-Nevada.

In 2004, annual testing for impairment pursuant to FAS No. 142
(comparison of implied goodwill value to carrying value) resulted in an impairment charge against goodwill for the Pajingo operation (Australia/New Zealand Segment) of $52. The impairment resulted from a reevaluation of future production and
operating costs that indicated lower grade material and higher future operating costs. The Company also adjusted valuation allowances, originally recorded as part of the purchase price allocation for the acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada,
for deferred tax assets related to capital loss carry-forwards in the Australia/New Zealand Segment for the Tanami operation and in the Merchant Banking Segment.

NOTE 19    DEBT

Scheduled minimum debt repayments are $159 in 2007, $243 in 2008, $125 in 2009, $133 in 2010, $104

thereafter. The lease includes purchase options during and at the end of the lease at predetermined prices. The interest rate on this sale-leaseback
transaction is 6.36%. In connection with this transaction, the Company entered into certain interest rate hedging contracts that were settled for a gain of $11, which is recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the term of the lease.
Including this gain, the effective interest rate on the borrowing is 6.15%. The related asset is specialized, therefore it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of this debt.

respectively, was due to NTMC, an unrelated third-party, and is non-recourse to Newmont, with the remainder payable to a subsidiary consolidated by Newmont.
Payments of $3 and $14 were made to NTMC during 2006 and 2005, respectively. Borrowings under the Shareholder Loans are guaranteed by NTP and are payable on demand, subject to the Senior Debt subordination terms. The Shareholder Loans are based on
the six-month Singapore Interbank Offering Rate (“SIBOR”) plus 3% for principal and SIBOR rate plus 4% for any unpaid accrued interest. The weighted average interest rates were 8.2%, 6.3% and 7.6% during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
and the interest rates were 8.4% and 7.6% as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The fair market value cannot be practicably determined due to the lack of available market information for this type of debt.

Newmont and NTMC provide a contingent support line of credit to PTNNT. No funding was required in 2006. Available additional support from NTP’s
partners was $65, of which Newmont’s pro-rata share was $37, as of December 31, 2006.

Project Financings

PTNNT Project Financing Facility

PTNNT has a project financing facility with a syndicate of banks. The scheduled repayments of this debt are semi-annual installments of $43 through November 2010 and $22 from May 2011 through November 2013. Amounts outstanding under the
project financing were $480 and $566 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.

The project financing facility is non-recourse to Newmont and
substantially all of PTNNT’s assets are pledged as collateral. The carrying value of the property, plant and mine development was $1,456 and $1,449 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Under the terms of the project financing
facility, PTNNT maintains an escrow account for the next interest and principal installment due. Such amount totaled $61 and $62 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and was included in

Other long-term assets

. The facility
contains certain covenants that limit indebtedness and restricted payments to partners, among others. In addition, PTNNT must maintain certain financial ratios. As of December 31, 2006, PTNNT was in compliance with these covenants.

The interest rate is based on blended fixed and floating rates and at market rates on December 31, 2006, the weighted average interest rate
approximated LIBOR plus 1.6%. The weighted average interest rates were 6.7%, 5.7% and 5.1% during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and the interest rates were 7.0% and 6.5% as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The fair market value
cannot be practicably determined due to the lack of available market information for this type of debt.

Ahafo

Proposed financing.

In June 2006, Newmont Ghana Gold Limited (“NGGL”), a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a $125 project financing with the International Finance
Corporation (“IFC”). The financing is comprised of a $75 A-loan funded by the IFC; and a $50 B-loan funded by a syndicate of commercial lenders. The financing contains certain Conditions of Disbursement that must be completed
prior to funds being made available. NGGL anticipates meeting the Conditions of Disbursement during the first half of 2007. Amounts borrowed under the financing will be collateralized by the assets of the Ahafo project and will be
guaranteed by Newmont pending the successful completion of requirements associated with the Project Financial Completion Certificate (“Project Financial Completion”). The loans will require semi-annual payments beginning in April
2007. The A-loan has a final maturity of October 2018 and borrowings will be subject to an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.125% pre-completion, and LIBOR plus 2.00% following Project Financial Completion. The B-loan has a final maturity of
October 2017 and borrowings will be subject to an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.80% pre-completion, and LIBOR plus 1.40% post-completion for the first 4-years. The interest rate on the B-loan then increases to LIBOR plus 1.70% (years 5-7);
LIBOR plus 1.90% (years 8-9) and LIBOR plus 2.00% (thereafter).

Corporate Revolving Credit Facilities

The Company has an uncollateralized $1,250 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks, which matures in July 2010. The facility
contains a letter of credit sub-facility. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company’s senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest at an annual interest rate of
the greater of LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.22% to 1.00%, the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the lead bank’s prime interest rate. Facility fees accrue at an annual rate ranging from 0.080% to 0.250% of the aggregate commitments. The
Company also pays a utilization fee of 0.10% on the amount of revolving credit loans and letters of credit outstanding under the facility for each day on which the sum of such loans and letters of credit exceed 50% of the commitments under the
facility. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the facility fees were 0.09% of the commitment. There was $321 and $275 outstanding under the letter of credit sub-facility as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Debt Covenants

public debt covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, limitation on sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions.

In addition to the covenants noted above, the corporate revolving credit facility contains financial ratio covenants requiring the Company to maintain a
net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of less than or equal to 4.0 and a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to
62.5%. Furthermore, the corporate revolving credit facility contains covenants limiting the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, certain change of control provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets.

Certain of the Company’s project debt facilities contain debt covenants and default provisions including limitations on dividends subject to certain
debt service cover ratios, limitations on sales of assets, negative pledges on certain assets, change of control provisions and limitations of additional permitted debt.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company and its related entities were in compliance with all debt covenants and default provisions.

NOTE 20    EMPLOYEE-RELATED BENEFITS

Pension Plans

The Company’s pension plans include: (1) two qualified non-contributory defined benefit plans (for salaried employees and substantially all domestic hourly union employees); (2) one non-qualified plan
(for salaried employees whose benefits under the qualified plan are limited by federal legislation); (3) two qualified plans for salaried and hourly Canadian employees; (4) one non-qualified plan for employees of PTNNT and (5) an
international plan for select employees who are not eligible to participate in the U.S.-based plans because of citizenship. The vesting period for plans identified in (1) and (2) is five years of service. These plans’ benefit formulas
are based on an employee’s years of credited service and either (i) such employee’s highest consecutive five years average pay (salaried plan) or (ii) a flat dollar amount adjusted by a service-weighted multiplier (hourly plan).
The Canadian plan provides for full vesting of benefits upon remittance and the benefit formula is based on a percentage of annual pay. The PTNNT plan is based on Indonesian Labor Law and provides for benefits to employees at age 55 or if employment
is terminated at mine closing. The benefits formula under the Indonesian Labor Law is based on an employee’s current salary and years of service prior to retirement or termination of employment at mine closing. The international retirement
plan’s basic and savings accounts have a graded vesting schedule and are fully vested after four years of service. The international retirement plan’s supplemental account is vested after attaining age 55 with 10 years of service or
attaining age 62. The plan’s benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document.

Pension costs
are determined annually by independent actuaries and pension contributions to the qualified plans are made based on funding standards established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

Other Benefit Plans

The Company provides defined
medical and life insurance benefits to selected qualified U.S. and Canadian retirees (generally salaried employees and to a limited extent their eligible dependents). In general, participants



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

become eligible for these benefits upon retirement directly from the Company if they are at least 55 years old and, for U.S. employees, the combination of
their age and years of service with the Company equals 75 or more. This benefit is not provided to employees who joined the Company after January 1, 2003.

Defined medical benefits cover most of the reasonable and customary charges for hospital, surgical, diagnostic and physician services and prescription drugs. Life insurance benefits are based on a percentage of final
base annual salary and decline over time after retirement commences. The majority of the costs of these medical and life insurance benefits are paid by the Company. In 2003, the Company began a strategy to more equitably share costs with retirees;
by 2008, 75% of retiree medical coverage cost will be paid by the Company. Qualified retirees that become eligible after January 1, 2003 are required to contribute additional amounts to the medical coverage.

Under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”), beginning in 2006, the Act provides a prescription
drug benefit under Medicare Part D, as well as a federal subsidy to plan sponsors of retiree healthcare plans that provide a prescription drug benefit to their participants that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit that is available
under Medicare. The Company sponsors retiree health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits to eligible retirees that our plan actuaries have determined are actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The effect of the Act was to decrease
post-retirement projected benefit obligation by $8 in 2006.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB
Statement No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (“FAS 158”). FAS 158 required employers that
sponsor one or more defined benefit plans to (i) recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in its statement of financial position, (ii) recognize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period as a
component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, (iii) measure the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end statement of financial position, and (iv) disclose in the notes to the
financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. The
impact of adopting FAS 158 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows:

The following tables provide a reconciliation of changes in the plans’ benefit obligations and
assets’ fair values for the two-year period ended December 31, 2006:

The Company’s qualified pension plans are funded with cash contributions in compliance with
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) rules and regulations. The Company’s non-qualified and other benefit plans are currently not funded, but exist as general corporate obligations. The information contained in the above tables indicates
the combined funded status of qualified and non-qualified plans, in accordance with accounting pronouncements. Assumptions used for IRS purposes differ from those used for accounting purposes. The funded status shown above compares the projected
benefit obligation (“PBO”) of all plans, which is an actuarial present value of obligations that takes into account assumptions as to future compensation levels of plan participants, to the fair value of the assets held in trust for the
qualified plans. Accounting pronouncements also prescribe a computation for the plans’ accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”), which is an actuarial present value of benefits (whether vested or nonvested) attributed to employees based
on employee service and compensation prior to the end of the period presented. The Company is currently planning to contribute $65 to its retirement benefit programs in 2007.

The following plans have an ABO in excess of the market value of plan assets:

For the pension plans, prior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average
remaining service period of active participants. Gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants. Pension
and postretirement benefits are accrued during an employee’s service to the Company.

Significant assumptions were as follows:

Yield curves matching our benefit obligations were derived using a cash flow analysis under the
Citigroup pension discount curve. The Citigroup pension discount curve shows the relationship between interest rates and duration for hypothetical zero coupon investments. Under this approach, Treasury par curve data is used to set the shape of the
yield curve and calculate the AA corporate spot yield at each maturity. The resulting curve was used to identify a discount rate for the Company of 5.9% and 5.75% in 2006 and 2005, respectively, based on the timing of future benefit payments. The
decision to use 8% as the expected long-term return on plan assets was made based on an analysis of the actual plan asset returns over multiple time horizons and review of assumptions used by other U.S. corporations with defined benefit plans of
similar size and investment strategy and is reviewed periodically by the audit committee. The average actual return on plan assets during the 18 years ended December 31, 2006 approximated 10%.

The pension plan employs several independent investment firms which invest the assets of the plan in certain approved funds that correspond to specific
asset classes with associated target allocations. Depending upon actual sector performance, the assets in the plan are periodically rebalanced to match the established target levels for the asset classes. The goal of the pension fund investment
program is to achieve expected rates of return consistent with the investment risk associated with the approved investment portfolio. The investment performance of the plan and that of the individual investment firms is measured against recognized
market indices. This performance is monitored by an investment committee comprised of members of the Company’s management, which is advised by an independent investment consultant. The performance of the plan is reviewed annually with the Audit
Committee of the Company’s board of directors. The following is a summary of the target asset allocations for 2006 and the actual asset allocation for 2006.

The assumed health care cost trend rate to measure the expected cost of benefits was 10% for 2007, 9%
for 2008, 8% for 2009, 7% for 2010, 6% for 2011 and 5% each year thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost

Savings Plans

The Company has two qualified defined contribution savings plans, one that covers salaried and non-union hourly employees and one that covers substantially all hourly union employees. In addition, the Company has one
non-qualified supplemental savings plan for salaried employees whose benefits under the qualified plan are limited by federal regulations. When an employee meets eligibility requirements, the Company matches 100% of employee contributions of up to
6% and 5% of base salary for the salaried (including non-union hourly employees) and hourly plans, respectively. Matching contributions are made with Newmont stock; however, no holding restrictions are placed on such contributions, which totaled $11
in 2006, $10 in 2005 and $9 in 2004.

NOTE 21    STOCK BASED COMPENSATION

Employee Stock Options

The Company has a Stock
Incentive Plan (“Stock Plan”) for executives and eligible employees. Under this Stock Plan, options to purchase shares of stock can be granted with exercise prices not less than fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of
grant. Fair market value of a share of common stock as of the grant date is the average of the high and low sales prices for a share of the Company’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company also maintains prior stock plans, but
no longer grants awards under these plans. Options granted under the Company’s stock plans vest over periods ranging from two to four years and are exercisable over a period of time not to exceed 10 years from grant date. As of
December 31, 2006, 17,551,234 shares were available for future grants under the Stock Plan. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, 1,238,750, 2,002,638 and 2,030,722 stock option awards were granted, respectively.



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(dollars in
millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

The value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option award and stock price volatility. The expected term of options granted is derived from historical
data on employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination experience. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. In
addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those options expected to vest. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our recorded and pro forma stock-based compensation expense could have
been different from that reported. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model used the following assumptions:

The following table summarizes annual activity for all stock options for each of the three years

As of December 31, 2006, there was $25 of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested
stock options. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.9 years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $54, $25 and $58, respectively.

Other Stock-Based Compensation

The Company grants restricted stock to certain employees upon achievement of certain financial and operating thresholds at fair market value on the grant
date. Prior to vesting, these shares of restricted stock are subject to certain restrictions related to ownership and transferability. Holders of restricted stock are entitled to vote the shares and to receive any dividends declared on the shares.
In 2006, 2005, and 2004, 102,491, 169,661, and 285,155 shares of restricted stock, respectively, were granted and issued, at the weighted-average fair market value of $58, $45, and $42, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, 100,258, 99,924 and
77,004 shares remained unvested for the 2006, 2005 and 2004 grants, respectively. The shares of restricted stock vest in three equal increments over three years.

Restricted stock units are granted upon achievement of certain financial and operating thresholds to employees in certain foreign jurisdictions. In 2006, 2005, and 2004 the Company granted 19,181, 27,386, and 18,788
restricted stock units, respectively, at the weighted-average fair market value of $58, $45 and $42, respectively, per underlying share of the Company’s common stock. As of December 31, 2006, 13,193, 11,791 and 1,214 shares remain unvested
for the 2006, 2005 and 2004 grants, respectively. These restricted stock units vest in three equal increments over three years. Prior to vesting, holders of restricted stock units are not entitled to vote the underlying shares or receive dividends.
Upon vesting, the employee is entitled to receive for each restricted stock unit one share of the Company’s common stock and an amount equivalent to accrued dividends.

The Company grants deferred stock awards to certain other employees. The deferred stock awards vest over periods between two to three years. In 2006,
2005 and 2004, the Company granted deferred stock awards of 237,946, 165,251, and 158,219 shares of the Company’s common stock, respectively, at weighted-average fair

and 2004 awards, respectively. Prior to vesting, holders of deferred stock are not entitled to vote the underlying shares or receive dividends. Upon vesting, the employee is entitled to receive the number of shares of the Company’s common stock
specified in the deferred stock award.

Compensation expense recorded for other stock-based compensation was $8, $15 and $15 in 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. The total fair value of other stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $20, $15 and $15, respectively.

NOTE 22    OTHER LIABILITIES

NOTE 23    RECLAMATION AND REMEDIATION (ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS)

The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the
environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations are in compliance with
applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. Estimated
future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, $520 and $428,
respectively, were accrued for reclamation obligations relating to currently or recently producing mineral properties. In addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily
historic, mining activities.

NOTE 27    SEGMENT AND RELATED
INFORMATION

Newmont predominantly operates in a single industry, namely exploration for and production of gold. Newmont’s major
operations include Nevada, Yanacocha, Australia/New Zealand, Batu Hijau and Africa. Newmont also has an Exploration Segment and a Merchant Banking Segment.

The Exploration Segment is responsible for all activities, regardless of location, associated with the Company’s efforts to discover new mineralized material that will advance into proven and probable reserves.

Merchant Banking activities include the development of value optimization strategies for operating and non- operating assets, managing the
equity investment portfolio, business development activities related to potential merger and acquisition analysis and negotiations, managing and building the royalty business, managing the investments in the down-stream gold refining and
distribution business, mobilizing and monetizing inactive exploration properties, capitalizing on Newmont’s proprietary technology know-how and acting as an internal resource for other corporate divisions to improve and maximize business
outcomes. For segment reporting purposes, the Merchant Banking Segment is considered to be a separate operating segment because it engages in activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses and its operating results are regularly and
separately reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker.

The Company identifies its reportable segments as those consolidated mining
operations or functional groups that represent more than 10% of the combined revenue, profit or loss or total assets of all reported operating segments. Consolidated mining operations or functional groups not meeting this threshold are aggregated at
the applicable geographic or corporate level for segment reporting purposes. Earnings from operations do not reflect general corporate expenses, interest (except project-specific interest) or income taxes (except for equity investments).
Intercompany revenue and expense amounts have been eliminated within each segment in order to report on the basis that management uses internally for evaluating segment performance.

NOTE 29    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

General

The Company follows FAS No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies,” in determining its accruals and disclosures with respect to loss contingencies. Accordingly, estimated losses from loss contingencies are accrued by a charge to income when information available prior to
issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable (greater than a 75% probability) that a liability could be been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal expenses associated with the contingency are
expensed as incurred. If a loss contingency is not probable or reasonably estimable, disclosure of the loss contingency is made in the financial statements when it is at least reasonably possible that a material loss could be incurred.

Operating Segments

The Company’s operating
segments are identified in Note 27. Except as noted in this paragraph, all of the Company’s commitments and contingencies specifically described in this Note 29 relate to the Corporate and Other reportable segment. The Nevada Operations matters
under Newmont USA Limited relate to the Nevada reportable segment. The PT Newmont Minahasa Raya matters relate to the Other Operations reportable segment. The Yanacocha matters relate to the Yanacocha reportable segment. The Newmont Yandal
Operations Pty Limited and the Newmont Australia Limited matters relate to the Australia/New Zealand reportable segment.

Environmental Matters

The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the
environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations are in compliance with
applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.

Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
$520 and $428, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to mineral properties in accordance with FAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” of which $67 is classified as current liabilities expected
to be spent in 2007. See Note 23.

In addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated
with former mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. The Company believes that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in
nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the compliance required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon the Company’s best estimate of its liability for these matters, $85 and $77 were
accrued for such obligations as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. These amounts are included in

Other current liabilities

and

Reclamation and remediation liabilities

. Depending upon the ultimate
resolution of these matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 89% greater or 27% lower than the amount accrued as of December 31, 2006. The amounts accrued for these
matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are recorded in

Other expense, net

in the period estimates are revised.

Details about certain of the more significant matters involved are discussed below.

Dawn Mining Company LLC (“Dawn”)—51% Newmont Owned

Midnite Mine Site.

Dawn previously leased an open pit uranium mine, currently inactive, on the Spokane Indian Reservation in
the State of Washington. The mine site is subject to regulation by agencies of the U.S. Department of Interior (the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land Management), as well as the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(“EPA”).

In 1991, Dawn’s mining lease at the mine was terminated. As a result, Dawn was required to file a formal mine
closure and reclamation plan. The Department of Interior commenced an analysis of Dawn’s proposed plan and alternate closure and reclamation plans for the mine. Work on this analysis has been suspended indefinitely. In mid-2000, the mine was
included on the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). In March 2003, the EPA notified Dawn and Newmont that it had thus far expended $12 on the Remedial
Investigation/Feasibility Study under CERCLA (“RI/FS”). In October 2005, the EPA issued the RI/FS on this property in which it indicated a preferred remedy estimated to cost approximately $150. Newmont and Dawn filed comments on the RI/FS
with the EPA in January 2006. On October 3, 2006, the EPA issued a final Record of Decision in which it formally selected the preferred remedy identified in the RI/FS.

On January 28, 2005, the EPA filed a lawsuit against Dawn and Newmont under CERCLA in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Washington. The EPA has asserted that Dawn and Newmont are liable for reclamation or remediation work and costs at the mine. Dawn does not have sufficient funds to pay for the reclamation plan it proposed or for any alternate plan, or for any
additional remediation work or costs at the mine. Newmont intends to vigorously contest any claims as to its liability.

Newmont cannot
reasonably predict the likelihood or outcome of this lawsuit or any other action against Dawn or Newmont arising from this matter.

Dawn
Mill Site.

Dawn also owns a uranium mill site facility, located on private land near Ford, Washington, which is subject to state and federal regulation. In late 1999, Dawn sought and later received state approval for a
revised closure plan that expedites the reclamation process at the site. The currently approved plan for the site is guaranteed by Newmont.

Idarado Mining Company (“Idarado”)—80.1% Newmont Owned

In July 1992, Newmont and Idarado signed a
consent decree with the State of Colorado (“State”), which was agreed to by the U.S. District Court of Colorado, to settle a lawsuit brought by the State under CERCLA.

Idarado agreed in the consent decree to undertake specified remediation work at its former mining site in the Telluride/Ouray area of Colorado.
Remediation work at this property is substantially complete. If the remediation does not achieve specific performance objectives defined in the consent decree, the State may require Idarado to implement supplemental activities at the site, also as
defined in the consent decree. Idarado and Newmont obtained a $6 reclamation bond to secure their potential obligations under the consent decree. In addition, Idarado settled natural resources damages and past and future response costs, and agreed
to habitat enhancement work under the consent decree. All of this work is substantially complete.

Newmont Capital Limited—100% Newmont Owned

In February 1999, the EPA placed the Lava Cap mine site in Nevada County, California on the National Priorities List under CERCLA. The EPA then initiated
a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study under CERCLA to determine environmental conditions and remediation options at the site.

Newmont
Capital, formerly known as Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation, Inc., owned the property for approximately three years from 1984 to 1986 but never mined or conducted exploration at the site. The EPA asserts that Newmont Capital is responsible for clean
up costs incurred at the site. Newmont Capital and the EPA have entered into an agreement tolling the statute of limitations until December 31, 2007 to facilitate on-going settlement negotiations with respect to potential claims under CERCLA.
Based on Newmont Capital’s limited involvement at Lava Cap, it does not believe it has any liability for environmental conditions at the site, and intends to vigorously defend any formal claims by the EPA. Newmont cannot reasonably predict the
likelihood or outcome of any future action arising from this matter.

Newmont USA Limited—100% Newmont Owned

Pinal Creek.

Newmont is a defendant in a lawsuit brought on November 5, 1991 in U.S. District Court in Arizona by
the Pinal Creek Group, alleging that the company and others are responsible for some portion of costs incurred to address groundwater contamination emanating from copper mining operations located in the area of Globe and Miami, Arizona. Two former
subsidiaries of Newmont, Pinto Valley Copper Corporation and Magma Copper Company (now known as BHP Copper Inc.), owned some of the mines in the area between 1983 and 1987. The court has dismissed plaintiffs’ claims seeking to hold Newmont
liable for the acts or omissions of its former subsidiaries. Based on information presently available, Newmont believes it has strong defenses to plaintiffs’ remaining claims, including, without limitation, that Newmont’s agents did not
participate in any pollution causing activities; that Newmont’s liabilities, if any, were contractually transferred to one of the plaintiffs; that portions of plaintiffs’ claimed damages are not recoverable; and that Newmont’s
equitable share of liability, if any, would be immaterial. While Newmont has denied liability and is vigorously defending these claims, we cannot reasonably predict the final outcome of this lawsuit.

Nevada Operations.

On November 19, 2002, Great Basin Mine Watch and the Mineral Policy Center (Appellants) filed suit
in U.S. District Court in Nevada against the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), challenging and seeking to enjoin the BLM’s July 2002 Record of Decision approving the Company’s amended Plan of Operations
covering the Gold Quarry South Layback Project, and the BLM’s September 2002 Record of Decision approving a new Plan of Operations for the Leeville Mine. Appellants sought a declaration that the BLM’s decisions were unlawful and an
injunction prohibiting Newmont’s approved activities. Newmont intervened in this action on behalf of the government defendants and filed an answer denying all of Appellants’ claims. In March 2004, the Court granted summary judgment in
favor of the government and Newmont on all claims, thus ending the U.S. District Court proceedings. In June 2004, Appellants appealed the U.S. District Court’s decision to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 1, 2006, the
Ninth Circuit affirmed the U.S. District Court’s decision in all respects except one, remanding the case to the District Court to address the need for additional cumulative impact studies, including air emissions and hazardous waste disposal.
In January, 2007, the parties entered into a stipulation ending their dispute in this matter and requiring BLM to prepare supplemental environmental impact statements evaluating the cumulative impacts of these projects. On January 16, 2007, the
Court, pursuant to the parties' request, entered final judgment to reflect this agreement.

On October 16, 2002, Great Basin Mine
Watch filed an appeal with the Nevada State Environmental Commission, challenging the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection’s (NDEP) renewal of the Clean



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(dollars in
millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Water Act discharge permit for Newmont’s Gold Quarry Mine. This permit governs the conditions under which Newmont may discharge mine-dewatering water in
connection with its ongoing mining operations. Great Basin Mine Watch alleged that the terms of the renewed permit violate the Clean Water Act and Nevada water quality laws. Newmont intervened in this action on behalf of the NDEP. A hearing before
the Nevada State Environmental Commission was held in June 2003 in Elko, Nevada. At the end of the hearing, the Commission ruled in favor of NDEP on all claims and affirmed NDEP’s renewal of the Clean Water Act discharge permit. Great Basin
Mine Watch appealed this decision in the Nevada District Court in Carson City, Nevada. In September 2004, the Nevada District Court ruled in favor of NDEP on most issues but ruled in favor of Great Basin Mine Watch with respect to certain proposed
permit amendments. Newmont and NDEP filed an appeal with the Nevada Supreme Court, seeking to uphold these proposed amendments. The Nevada District Court stayed its decision pending this appeal and Gold Quarry continued to operate under its new
permit. On December 5, 2006, a panel of the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the original decision of NDEP to grant the discharge permit. Newmont will now continue to operate under the new permit.

Grass Valley

.    On February 3, 2004, the City of Grass Valley, California brought suit against Newmont under CERCLA in
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. This matter involves an abandoned mine adit on property previously owned by a predecessor of Newmont and currently owned by the City of Grass Valley. The complaint alleges that the
adit is discharging metals-bearing water into a stream on the property, in concentrations in excess of current EPA drinking water standards. Newmont cannot reasonably predict the likely outcome of this matter.

Gray Eagle Mine Site

.    By letter dated September 3, 2002, the EPA notified Newmont that the EPA had expended $3 in
response costs to address environmental conditions associated with a historic tailings pile located at the Grey Eagle Mine site near Happy Camp, California, and requested that Newmont pay those costs. The EPA has identified four potentially
responsible parties, including Newmont. Newmont does not believe it has any liability for environmental conditions at the Grey Eagle Mine site, and intends to vigorously defend any formal claims by the EPA. Newmont cannot reasonably predict the
likelihood or outcome of any future action against it arising from this matter.

PT Newmont Minahasa Raya
(“PTNMR”)—80% Newmont Owned

In July 2004, a criminal complaint was filed against PTNMR, the Newmont subsidiary that
operated the Minahasa mine in Indonesia, alleging environmental pollution relating to submarine tailings placement into nearby Buyat Bay. The Indonesian police detained five PTNMR employees during September and October of 2004. The police
investigation and the detention of PTNMR’s employees was declared illegal by the South Jakarta District Court in December 2004, but in March 2005, the Indonesian Supreme Court upheld the legality of the police investigation, and the police
turned their evidence over to the local prosecutor. In July 2005, the prosecutor filed an indictment against PTNMR and its President Director, alleging environmental pollution at Buyat Bay. After the court rejected motions to dismiss the proceeding,
the trial proceeded and all evidence, including that of the defense, was presented in court as of September 2006. In November 2006 the prosecution filed its charge, seeking a three-year jail sentence for PTNMR’s President Director plus a
nominal fine. In addition, the prosecution has recommended a nominal fine against PTNMR. The defense filed responses in January 2007 and after final briefing a verdict is expected in the second quarter of 2007.

On March 9, 2005, the Indonesian Ministry of the Environment filed a civil lawsuit against PTNMR and its President Director in relation to these
allegations, seeking in excess of $100 in monetary damages. In October 2005, PTNMR filed an objection to the court’s jurisdiction, contending that the Government previously agreed to resolve any disputes through out-of-court conciliation or
arbitration. The Court upheld PTNMR’s objection and



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(dollars in
millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

dismissed the case in November 2005. The Government filed a notice of appeal of this ruling. On February 16, 2006, PTNMR and the Government of the
Republic of Indonesia signed an agreement settling the civil lawsuit. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government and PTNMR will nominate members to an independent scientific panel that will develop and implement a ten-year environmental
monitoring and assessment program to make a definitive, scientific conclusion regarding the condition of Buyat Bay. PTNMR is required to fund specific remedial measures if, as a result of its mining operations, pollution has occurred. The
agreement also provides for enhanced community development programs in North Sulawesi. PTNMR will provide initial funding of $12 to cover the cost of the monitoring and community development programs which is included in

Other current
liabilities

as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Over a ten year period, PTNMR will contribute an additional $18. The present value of $13 and $12 is included in

Other long-term liabilities

as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The funds will be managed by an organization governed by interested stakeholders. Accountability for the fund will be ensured through yearly reports that will be made available to the public. The transparency of the scientific
panel’s activities will also be assured through annual reports to the public. Pursuant to the agreement, the civil lawsuit against PTNMR has been terminated. The scientific panel held its first meeting in February 2007.

Independent sampling and testing of Buyat Bay water and fish, as well as area residents, conducted by the World Health Organization and the Australian
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, confirm that PTNMR has not polluted the Buyat Bay environment, and, therefore, has not adversely affected the fish in Buyat Bay or the health of nearby residents. The Company remains
steadfast that it has not caused pollution or health problems and will continue to vigorously defend itself against these allegations. However, Newmont cannot predict the outcome of the criminal proceeding or whether additional legal actions may
occur. This matter could adversely affect our ability to operate in Indonesia.

Resurrection Mining Company
(“Resurrection”)—100% Newmont Owned

Newmont, Resurrection and other defendants were named in lawsuits filed by the
State of Colorado under CERCLA in 1983, which were subsequently consolidated with a lawsuit filed by EPA in 1986. These proceedings sought to compel the defendants to remediate the impacts of pre-existing, historic mining activities near Leadville,
Colorado, which date back to the mid-1800s, and which the government agencies claim were causing substantial environmental problems in the area.

In 1988 and 1989, the EPA issued administrative orders with respect to one area on the site and the defendants have collectively implemented those orders by constructing a water treatment plant, which was placed in operation in early 1992.
Remaining remedial work for this area consists of water treatment plant operation and continuing environmental monitoring and maintenance activities. Newmont and Resurrection are currently responsible for 50% of these costs, but their share of such
costs could increase in the event other defendants become unable to pay their share of such costs. On August 9, 2005, ASARCO LLC, the party responsible for the other 50% of these costs, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. The company is evaluating the effect that the ASARCO bankruptcy could have on its obligations.

The parties also have entered into a consent decree with respect to the remaining areas at the site, which apportions liabilities and responsibilities for these areas. The EPA has approved remedial actions for selected components of
Resurrection’s portion of the site, which were initiated in 1995. The EPA has not yet selected the final remedy for the site. Accordingly, Newmont cannot yet determine the full extent or cost of its share of the remedial action that will be
required. The government agencies may also seek to recover for damages to natural resources. In March 1999, the parties entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) to facilitate the



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(dollars in
millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

settlement of natural resources damages claims under CERCLA for the upper Arkansas River Basin. In January 2004, an MOU report was issued that evaluated the
extent of natural resource damages and possible restoration activities that might be required, which Resurrection and other parties could potentially be required to fund.

Other Legal Matters

Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”)—51.35% Newmont Owned

Choropampa

.    In June 2000, a transport contractor of Yanacocha spilled approximately 151 kilograms of
elemental mercury near the town of Choropampa, Peru, which is located 53 miles (85 kilometers) southwest of the Yanacocha mine. Elemental mercury is not used in Yanacocha’s operations but is a by-product of gold mining and was sold to a Lima
firm for use in medical instruments and industrial applications. A comprehensive health and environmental remediation program was undertaken by Yanacocha in response to the incident. In August 2000, Yanacocha paid under protest a fine of 1,740,000
Peruvian soles (approximately $0.5) to the Peruvian government. Yanacocha has entered into settlement agreements with a number of individuals impacted by the incident. As compensation for the disruption and inconvenience caused by the incident
Yanacocha entered into agreements with and provided a variety of public works in the three communities impacted by this incident. Yanacocha cannot predict the likelihood of additional expenditures related to this matter.

Yanacocha, various wholly-owned subsidiaries of Newmont, and other defendants have been named in lawsuits filed by approximately 1,100 Peruvian citizens
in Denver District Court for the State of Colorado. These actions seek compensatory and punitive damages based on claims associated with the elemental mercury spill incident. In February 2005, Yanacocha and the various Newmont defendants answered
the complaint in the Denver District Court. The parties in these cases have agreed to submit these matters to binding arbitration.

Additional lawsuits relating to the Choropampa incident were filed against Yanacocha in the local courts of Cajamarca, Peru, in May 2002 by over 900 Peruvian citizens. A significant number of the plaintiffs in these lawsuits entered into
settlement agreements with Yanacocha prior to filing such claims. In September 2006, the Peruvian Supreme Court issued contradictory opinions on the validity of these settlement agreements. Subsequent lower court decisions have upheld the validity
of these settlement agreements, discharging a number of the lawsuits. In 2005, Yanacocha entered into settlement agreements with approximately 350 additional plaintiffs.

Neither Newmont nor Yanacocha can reasonably predict the final outcome of any of the above-described lawsuits.

Conga.

Yanacocha is involved in a dispute with the Provincial Municipality of Celendin regarding the authority of that governmental body to regulate the development of the Conga ore deposit. In the fourth
quarter of 2004, the Municipality of Celendin enacted an ordinance declaring the area around Conga to be a mining-free reserve and naturally protected area. Yanacocha has challenged this ordinance on the grounds that, under Peruvian law, local
governments lack authority to create such areas and deny the rights granted by Yanacocha’s mining concessions. Based on legal precedent established by Peru's Constitutional Tribunal, it is reasonable to believe that Yanacocha’s mining
rights will be upheld.

Yanacocha has carefully evaluated the social issues and dynamics of the communities in and around the area of
Conga. Yanacocha has engaged in extensive community and external affairs efforts at this early stage of the Conga project. It is Yanacocha’s current assessment that a significant percentage of the population in the communities immediately
surrounding the Conga area support the project. Yanacocha will continue to engage



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(dollars in
millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

actively with these communities during the process of permitting the project, and will expand its outreach efforts to communities in the surrounding region.
It will continually monitor and evaluate conditions in the area and any resulting impact on Yanacocha’s ability to successfully permit and develop the Conga deposit.

Newmont Mining Corporation

On June 8, 2005, UFCW Local 880—Retail Food Employers
Joint Pension Fund filed a putative class action in the federal district court in Colorado purportedly on behalf of purchasers of Newmont Mining Corporation (“Newmont”) publicly traded securities between July 28, 2004 and
April 26, 2005. The action named Newmont, Wayne W. Murdy, Pierre Lassonde and Bruce D. Hansen as defendants. Substantially similar purported class actions were filed in the same court on June 15, 2005 by John S. Chapman and on
June 20, 2005 by Zoe Myerson. In November 2005, the court consolidated these cases and, in March 2006, appointed a lead plaintiff. In April 2006, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint naming David Francisco, Russell Ball,
Thomas Enos and Robert Gallagher as additional defendants. It alleged, among other things, that Newmont and the individual defendants violated certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged operating
deficiencies and sought unspecified monetary damages and other relief. On October 20, 2006, the lead plaintiff, on behalf of a settlement class consisting of all purchasers of Newmont securities from November 1, 2003, through and including
March 23, 2006 (except defendants and certain related persons), entered into a Stipulation of Settlement with defendants. If approved by the Court, the Settlement (a) would release all claims asserted, or that could have been asserted, in
the action; (b) would provide for a payment by Newmont of $15 million to be distributed to class members pursuant to a plan of allocation developed by the lead plaintiff; and (c) would provide that all defendants deny any wrongdoing or
liability with respect to the settled matters. The parties have moved for preliminary approval of the settlement, but the court has not ruled on the motion. Gideon Minerals, U.S.A., Inc. (“Gideon”) has sought to intervene to bring a claim
alleging that Gideon has an interest in the Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia; the court has denied that motion. Gideon subsequently filed a substantially similar motion and moved for default judgment; the court has not ruled on these motions.

On June 14, 2005, June 30, 2005 and July 1, 2005, purported derivative actions were filed, on behalf of Newmont, by
Doris Staehr, Frank J. Donio and Jack G. Blaz, respectively, in the federal district court in Colorado against certain of Newmont’s current and former directors and officers. Each action alleged that certain defendants breached their fiduciary
duties by engaging in insider trading and misappropriation of information, and that all defendants breached their fiduciary duties and engaged in conduct that constituted abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust
enrichment in connection with, among other things, failing to disclose alleged operating deficiencies and failing to prevent alleged violations of environmental laws in Indonesia. The plaintiffs seek, on behalf of Newmont, among other remedies, all
damages sustained by the Company as a result of the allegedly improper conduct. In November 2005, the court consolidated these cases and in December 2005 the court appointed a lead plaintiff. On April 10, 2006, the lead plaintiff filed a
consolidated amended complaint. This action has been administratively closed without prejudice to any party filing a motion to reopen prior to June 19, 2007. The defendants deny the claims made and, should the case be re-opened, intend to
vigorously defend against them. The Company cannot reasonably predict the final outcome of these cases. In a related development, on January 13, 2006, a purported Newmont shareholder sent to the Board of Directors a letter demanding the Company
take action against the defendants in the purported derivative actions with respect to the matters alleged in the derivative complaints. The Board has taken the demand under consideration. Counsel for plaintiffs in the derivative actions,
counsel for the demanding shareholder and the Company have agreed to settle the action and related disputes on the basis of certain revisions to the Company's corporate governance arrangements, and are currently negotiating an attorneys' fee to be
paid by the Company.

Newmont Yandal Operations Pty Ltd (“NYOL”)—100% Newmont Owned

On September 3, 2003, J. Aron & Co. commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales (Australia) against
NYOL, its subsidiaries and the administrator in relation to the completed voluntary administration of the NYOL group. J. Aron & Co., an NYOL creditor, initially sought injunctive relief that was denied by the court on September 8,
2003. On October 30, 2003, J. Aron & Co. filed a statement of claim alleging various deficiencies in the implementation of the voluntary administration process and seeking damages and other relief against NYOL and other parties.
Newmont cannot reasonably predict the final outcome of this lawsuit.

Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture—50% Newmont Owned

In June 2006, an economic court in Uzbekistan ruled in favor of tax authorities and against the Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture
(“ZNJV”), which is 50% owned by the Company, on two claims to collect approximately $48 in taxes other than income taxes. The tax authorities argued that Decree 151, which protected ZNJV from changes in tax laws and provided other
financial and operational benefits, became ineffective and that the taxes and penalties claimed were owed for the period 2002-2005. Decree 151 had been granted by the Republic of Uzbekistan in 1992 as an incentive for the Company’s investment
in ZNJV. The benefits it provided, including the stability of the tax and legal regime in effect at that time, were guaranteed to remain in effect for so long as ZNJV had ongoing operations.

On July 26, 2006, the Republic of Uzbekistan caused the seizure of gold, silver and unfinished product belonging to ZNJV. On August 14, 2006,
the Company received notice that the economic court had accepted the petition of an agency of the Republic of Uzbekistan to institute a bankruptcy proceeding against ZNJV. Neither ZNJV nor the Company received advance notice that the petition was
filed or that a hearing would be held. The court ordered “supervisory measures” restricting normal operations, including the export of gold or repayment of loans, without the approval of a court-appointed temporary administrator, who has
been overseeing all operations of ZNJV.

At a September 19, 2006 meeting of the ZNJV creditor’s committee, which was principally
composed of government representatives, the committee voted to liquidate ZNJV. On September 29, 2006, the economic court concluded that ZNJV was insolvent and ordered ZNJV to be liquidated by December 29, 2006. At this hearing,
representatives of ZNJV and the Company were denied an opportunity to present the case against liquidation. The remaining assets of ZNJV are anticipated to be liquidated to pay the tax liabilities that have been imposed on ZNJV by the Republic of
Uzbekistan, resulting in the effective transfer to the Republic of Uzbekistan of the Company’s interest in ZNJV. The liquidation sale has been postponed two times, and is now scheduled for early March 2007. Despite the Company’s demands
for compensation for the losses it has suffered, the Republic of Uzbekistan has refused to provide such compensation. On October 31, 2006, the Company filed demands for arbitration against the Republic of Uzbekistan in two separate
international venues on the basis that the Republic of Uzbekistan repudiated its obligations to the Company under Decree 151, Uzbek and international law, and various agreements. The Company and the defendants are in the process of appointing
arbitrators. As of September 30, 2006, the Company has written off the book value of its ownership interest in ZNJV. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Income Taxes

The Company operates in numerous
countries around the world and accordingly it is subject to, and pays annual income taxes under, the various income tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local
government, and others are defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country. The Company has historically filed, and continues to file, all required income tax returns and to pay the taxes reasonably determined to be due. The tax
rules and regulations in many



NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(dollars in
millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. From time to time the Company is subject to a review of its historic income tax filings and in
connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules to the Company’s business conducted within the country involved. As of December 31, 2006 and
December 31, 2005, the Company has accrued income taxes (and related interest and penalties, if applicable) in the amount of $54 and $220, respectively, classified in

other long-term liabilities

. In December, the Company entered into an
in-principle HOA with the ATO. The HOA specifies the terms of a proposed settlement of the outstanding audit issues relating to Normandy for the tax years 1994-1999. These issues relate to years before the Company acquired Normandy. At the date of
the business combination, Normandy had recorded no income tax liability with respect to the tax positions taken in reporting certain transactions, therefore the Company’s initial best estimate of the FAS 5 income tax contingency relating to
these issues was recorded as a tax liability at the date of acquisition, February 15, 2002, by increasing the purchase price of Normandy. As of December 31, 2006, the long-term income tax liability balance relating to this proposed
settlement was reclassified to current income taxes payable.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

In a 1993 asset exchange, a wholly-owned subsidiary transferred a coal lease under which the subsidiary had collected advance royalty payments totaling
$484. From 1994 to 2018, remaining advance payments under the lease to the transferee total $390. In the event of title failure as stated in the lease, this subsidiary has a primary obligation to refund previously collected payments and has a
secondary obligation to refund any of the $390 collected by the transferee, if the transferee fails to meet its refund obligation. The subsidiary has title insurance on the leased coal deposits of $240 covering the secondary obligation. The Company
and the subsidiary regard the circumstances entitling the lessee to a refund as remote.

The Company has minimum royalty obligations on one
of its producing mines in Nevada for the life of the mine. Amounts paid as a minimum royalty (where production royalties are less than the minimum obligation) in any year are recoverable in future years when the minimum royalty obligation is
exceeded. Although the minimum royalty requirement may not be met in a particular year, the Company expects that over the mine life, gold production will be sufficient to meet the minimum royalty requirements. Minimum royalty payments payable are $8
for 2007, $13 for 2008, $2 in 2009 and 2010, $18 in 2011 and $98 thereafter.

As part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company
and its affiliates are required to provide surety bonds, bank letters of credit and bank guarantees as financial support for various purposes, including environmental reclamation, exploration permitting, workers compensation programs and other
general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, there were $445 and $386, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees. The surety bonds, letters of credit and bank guarantees
reflect fair value as a condition of their underlying purpose and are subject to fees competitively determined in the market place. The obligations associated with these instruments are generally related to performance requirements that the Company
addresses through its ongoing operations. As the specific requirements are met, the beneficiary of the associated instrument cancels and/or returns the instrument to the issuing entity. Certain of these instruments are associated with operating
sites with long-lived assets and will remain outstanding until closure. Generally, bonding requirements associated with environmental regulation are becoming more restrictive. In addition, the surety markets for certain types of environmental
bonding used by the Company have become increasingly constrained. The Company, however, believes it is in compliance with all applicable bonding obligations and will be able to satisfy future bonding requirements, through existing or alternative
means, as they arise.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(dollars in

Under the Batu Hijau Contract of Work with the Indonesian government, beginning in 2005, and
continuing through 2010, a portion of each foreign shareholders’ equity interest in the project must be offered for sale to the Indonesian government or to Indonesian nationals. The price at which such interest must be offered for sale to the
Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares of the project company would be accepted for listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or the fair market value of such interest in the project company as
a going concern. Pursuant to this provision of the Batu Hijau Contract of Work, it is possible that the ownership interest of the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership in Batu Hijau could be reduced to 49% by the end of 2010.

A company owned by an Indonesian national currently owns a 20% equity interest in Batu Hijau, and the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership was required to offer
a 3% interest in 2006. An offer to sell a 3% interest was made to the government of Indonesia. While the central government declined to participate, local governments in the area in which the mine is located have expressed interest in acquiring
shares, as have various Indonesian nationals. The Newmont/Sumitomo partnership continues discussions with various interested parties to meet its divestiture obligations. Under the terms of the Contract of Work, an additional 7% interest in Batu
Hijau must be offered for sale in 2007.

Newmont is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings related to its business. Except
in the above-described proceedings, management does not believe that adverse decisions in any pending or threatened proceeding or that amounts that may be required to be paid by reason thereof will have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

During the fiscal period
covered by this report, the Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
