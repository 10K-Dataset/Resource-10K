On February 3, 2011, Newmont and Fronteer Gold Inc.
    (“Fronteer”) announced that they entered into an
    agreement under which Newmont will acquire all of the
    outstanding common shares of Fronteer by way of a Plan of
    Arrangement (“Arrangement”). Under the Arrangement,
    shareholders of Fronteer will receive C$14.00 in cash and one
    common share in Pilot Gold Inc., a Canadian corporation, which
    will retain certain exploration assets of Fronteer, for each
    common share of Fronteer. The Arrangement will be subject to
    approval by at least 66% of the votes cast at a special meeting
    of Fronteer’s shareholders, expected to be held in April
    2011, and the subsequent approval of the Ontario Superior Court
    of Justice. The agreement also contains certain termination
    rights for both Newmont and Fronteer including a break fee of
    C$85 payable by Fronteer, if the transaction is not completed in
    certain specified circumstances. The transaction is expected to
    close in the second quarter of 2011 for approximately C$2,300.
    Fronteer owns, among other assets, the exploration stage Long
    Canyon project, which is located approximately one hundred miles
    from the Company’s existing infrastructure in Nevada and
    provides the potential for significant development and operating
    synergies.

Segment
    Information, Export Sales, etc.

Our operating segments include North America, South America,
    Asia Pacific and Africa. Our North America segment consists
    primarily of Nevada in the United States, La Herradura in
    Mexico and Hope Bay in Canada. Our South America segment
    consists primarily of Yanacocha and Conga in Peru. Our Asia
    Pacific segment consists primarily of Boddington in Australia,
    Batu Hijau in Indonesia and other smaller operations in
    Australia and New Zealand. Our Africa segment consists primarily
    of Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana. See Item 1A, Risk Factors,
    below and Note 3 to the Consolidated



Financial Statements for information relating to our operating
    segments, domestic and export sales, and lack of dependence on a
    limited number of customers.

Products

References in this report to attributable gold ounces or
    attributable copper pounds mean that portion of gold or copper
    produced, sold or included in proven and probable reserves based
    on our ownership

and/or

economic interest, unless otherwise noted.

Gold

General.

We had consolidated gold production
    of 6.5 million ounces (5.4 million ounces attributable
    to Newmont) in 2010, 6.5 million ounces (5.2 million
    ounces) in 2009 and 6.2 million ounces (5.2 million
    ounces) in 2008. Of our 2010 consolidated gold production,
    approximately 30% came from North America, 23% from South
    America, 39% from Asia Pacific and 8% from Africa.

For 2010, 2009 and 2008, 81%, 83% and 88%, respectively, of our

Sales

were attributable to gold. Most of our

Sales

comes from the sale of refined gold in the international
    market. The end product at our gold operations, however, is
    generally doré bars. Doré is an alloy consisting
    primarily of gold but also containing silver and other metals.
    Doré is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the
    required market standard of 99.95% gold. Under the terms of our
    refining agreements, the doré bars are refined for a fee,
    and our share of the refined gold and the separately-recovered
    silver are credited to our account or delivered to buyers. Gold
    sold from Batu Hijau in Indonesia and a portion of the gold from
    Boddington in Australia, Phoenix in Nevada and Yanacocha in
    Peru, is contained in a saleable concentrate containing other
    metals such as copper or silver.

Gold Uses.

Gold is generally used for
    fabrication or investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end
    uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and
    decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold
    investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry.

Gold Supply.

A combination of current mine
    production and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by
    governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations
    and private individuals make up the annual gold supply. Based on
    public information available for the years 2008 through 2010, on
    average, current mine production has accounted for approximately
    61% of the annual gold supply.

Gold Price.

The following table presents the
    annual high, low and average daily afternoon fixing prices for
    gold over the past ten years on the London Bullion Market

On February 18, 2011, the afternoon fixing gold price on
    the London Bullion Market was $1,384 per ounce and the spot
    market gold price on the New York Commodity Exchange was
    $1,388 per ounce.

We generally sell our gold at the prevailing market price during
    the month in which the gold is delivered to the customer. We
    recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable,
    the gold has been delivered, the title has been transferred and
    collection of the sales price is reasonably assured.

Copper

General.

We had consolidated copper production
    of 600 million pounds (327 million pounds attributable
    to Newmont) in 2010, 504 million pounds (227 million
    pounds) in 2009 and 285 million pounds (128 million
    pounds) in 2008. Copper production is in the form of saleable
    concentrate that is sold to smelters for further treatment and
    refining. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, 19%, 17% and 12%,
    respectively, of our

Sales

were attributable to copper.

Copper Uses.

Refined copper is incorporated
    into wire and cable products for use in the construction,
    electric utility, communications and transportation industries.
    Copper is also used in industrial equipment and machinery,
    consumer products and a variety of other electrical and
    electronic applications and is also used to make brass. Copper
    substitutes include aluminum, plastics, stainless steel and
    fiber optics. Refined, or cathode, copper is also an
    internationally traded commodity.

Copper Supply.

A combination of current mine
    production and recycled scrap material make up the annual copper
    supply.

Copper Price.

The copper price is quoted on
    the London Metal Exchange in terms of dollars per metric ton of
    high grade copper. The following table presents the dollar per
    pound equivalent of the annual high, low and average daily

On February 18, 2011, the high grade copper closing price
    on the London Metal Exchange was $4.48 per pound.

We generally sell our copper based on the monthly average market
    price for the third month following the month in which the
    delivery to the customer takes place. We recognize revenue from
    a sale when the price is determinable, the concentrate has been
    loaded on a vessel, the title has been transferred and
    collection of the sales price is reasonably assured. For revenue
    recognition, we use a provisional price based on the average
    prevailing market price during the two week period prior to



completion of vessel loading. The copper concentrate is marked
    to market through earnings until final settlement.

Gold and
    Copper Processing Methods

Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either heap
    leaching or milling, depending on the amount of gold contained
    in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related
    capital and operating costs. Higher grade oxide ores are
    generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into
    a fine powder and mixed with water in slurry, which then passes
    through a

carbon-in-leach

circuit. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using
    heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or

run-of-mine

ore on impermeable pads, where a weak cyanide solution is
    applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. In both
    cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected and pumped to
    process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or
    by zinc precipitation.

Gold contained in ores that are not naturally oxidized can be
    directly milled if the gold is amenable to cyanidation,
    generally known as free milling sulfide ores. Ores that are not
    amenable to cyanidation, known as refractory ores, require more
    costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free
    milling ore. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through
    either roasters or autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore
    to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the
    sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use
    heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores.

Some sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant or
    by bio-milling. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into
    slurry, then placed in a tank known as a flotation cell.
    Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing
    sulfides to attach to air bubbles and float to the top of the
    tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into
    a concentrate that can then be processed in an autoclave or
    roaster to recover the gold. Bio-milling incorporates patented
    technology that involves inoculation of suitable crushed ore on
    a leach pad with naturally occurring bacteria strains, which
    oxidize the sulfides over a period of time. The ore is then
    processed through an oxide mill.

At Batu Hijau, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a
    coarse size at the mine and then transported from the mine via
    conveyor to a concentrator, where it is finely ground and then
    treated by successive stages of flotation, resulting in a
    concentrate containing approximately 26% to 31% copper. The
    concentrate is dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for
    transport to smelters.

At Boddington, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a
    coarse size at the mine and then transported via conveyor to a
    process plant, where it is further crushed and then finely
    ground as a slurry. The ore is initially treated by flotation
    which produces a copper/gold concentrate containing
    approximately 18% copper. Flotation concentrates are processed
    via a gravity circuit to recover fine liberated gold and then
    dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for transport to
    smelters. The flotation tailing has a residual gold content that
    is recovered in a

carbon-in-leach

circuit.

Hedging
    Activities

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes
    in gold and copper prices by selling our gold and copper at
    current market prices and consequently, we do not hedge our gold
    and copper sales. We continue to manage certain risks associated
    with commodity input costs, interest rates and foreign
    currencies using the derivative market.

For additional information, see Hedging in Item 7A,
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and
    Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gold and Copper
    Reserves

At December 31, 2010 we had 93.5 million ounces of
    proven and probable gold reserves attributable to Newmont. We
    added 8.2 million ounces to proven and probable reserves,
    and depleted



6.5 million ounces during 2010. We also added
    0.3 million ounces to proven and probable reserves through
    acquisitions and divested 0.3 million ounces. 2010 reserves
    were calculated at a gold price assumption of $950, A$1,100 or
    NZ$1,350 per ounce, respectively. A reconciliation of the
    changes in proven and probable gold reserves during the past
    three years follows:

Our exploration efforts are directed to the discovery of new
    mineralized material and converting it into proven and probable
    reserves. We conduct near-mine exploration around our existing
    mines and greenfields exploration in other regions globally.
    Near-mine exploration can result in the discovery of additional
    deposits, which may receive the economic benefit of existing
    operating, processing, and administrative infrastructures. In
    contrast, the discovery of new mineralization through
    greenfields exploration efforts will likely require capital
    investment to build a separate, stand-alone operation. Our

Exploration

expense was $218, $187 and $213 in 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively.

For additional information, see Item 2, Properties, Proven
    and Probable Reserves.

Licenses and
    Concessions

Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing
    facilities, there are no third party patents, licenses or
    franchises material to our business. In many countries, however,
    we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to
    concessions granted by, or under contract with, the host



government. These countries include, among others, Australia,
    Canada, Ghana, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru and
    Suriname. The concessions and contracts are subject to the
    political risks associated with foreign operations. See
    Item 1A, Risk Factors, below. For a more detailed
    description of our Indonesian Contract of Work, see Item 2,
    Properties, below.

Condition of
    Physical Assets and Insurance

Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital
    investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of
    equipment and facilities. For more information, see Item 7,
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and
    Capital Resources, below.

We maintain insurance policies against property loss and
    business interruption and insure against risks that are typical
    in the operation of our business, in amounts that we believe to
    be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and
    limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to
    environmental liability and political risk. There can be no
    assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance
    policies in connection with a particular event. See
    Item 1A, Risk Factors, below.

Environmental
    Matters

Our United States mining and exploration activities are subject
    to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the
    protection of the environment, including the Clean Air Act; the
    Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and
    Community

Right-to-Know

Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Federal Land Policy and
    Management Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the
    Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and related state laws.
    These laws and regulations are continually changing and are
    generally becoming more restrictive. Our activities outside the
    United States are also subject to governmental regulations for
    the protection of the environment.

We conduct our operations so as to protect public health and the
    environment and believe our operations are in compliance with
    applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Each
    operating mine has a reclamation plan in place that meets all
    applicable legal and regulatory requirements. At
    December 31, 2010, $904 was accrued for reclamation costs
    relating to current or recently producing properties.

We are involved in several matters concerning environmental
    obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining
    activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and
    implementing remediation plans at the various sites. Based upon
    our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $144 was
    accrued at December 31, 2010 for such obligations
    associated with properties previously owned or operated by us or

    remediation activities, see Item 7, Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and
    Results of Operations, and Notes 4 and 31 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, below.

In addition to legal and regulatory compliance, we have
    developed complimentary programs to guide our company toward
    achieving environmental and sustainable development objectives.
    Evidencing our management’s commitment towards these
    objectives, in 2008, we moved our corporate headquarters to an
    environmentally sustainable, LEED, gold-certified building. We
    are also committed to managing climate change risks and
    responsibly reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. We have
    reported our greenhouse gas emissions annually to the Carbon
    Disclosure Project since 2004, became a Founding Reporter on The
    Climate Registry in 2008 and have committed to publicly
    reporting our independently-verified greenhouse gas emissions in
    the future. As a result of our efforts, we continue to achieve
    milestones, such as being the first gold company listed on the
    Dow Jones Sustainability Index World (“DJSI”),
    remaining a member of the DJSI for four consecutive years, and



receiving International Cyanide Management Code certification at
    100% of registered Newmont sites as of the end of 2009.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per
    pound amounts)

Our business activities are subject to significant risks,
    including those described below. Every investor or potential
    investor in our securities should carefully consider these
    risks. If any of the described risks actually occurs, our
    business, financial position and results of operations could be
    materially adversely affected. Such risks are not the only ones
    we face and additional risks and uncertainties not presently
    known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect
    our business.

A substantial
    or extended decline in gold or copper prices would have a
    material adverse effect on Newmont.

Our business is dependent on the prices of gold and copper,
    which fluctuate on a daily basis and are affected by numerous
    factors beyond our control. Factors tending to influence prices
    include:

•

gold sales or leasing by governments and central banks or
    changes in their monetary policy, including gold inventory
    management and reallocation of reserves;

•

speculative short positions taken by significant investors or
    traders in gold or copper;

•

the strength of the U.S. dollar;

•

expectations of the future rate of inflation;

•

interest rates;



•

recession or reduced economic activity in the United States and
    other industrialized or developing countries;

•

decreased industrial, jewelry or investment demand;

•

increased supply from production, disinvestment and scrap;

•

forward sales by producers in hedging or similar
    transactions; and

•

availability of cheaper substitute materials.

Any decline in our realized gold or copper price adversely
    impacts our revenues, net income and cash flows, particularly in
    light of our strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions
    with respect to gold or copper. We have recorded asset
    write-downs in the past and may experience additional
    write-downs as a result of lower gold or copper prices in the
    future.

In addition, sustained lower gold or copper prices can:

•

reduce revenues further through production declines due to
    cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits,
    that have become uneconomic at prevailing gold or copper prices;

•

reduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore
    stockpiles and ore on leach pads;

•

halt or delay the development of new projects;

•

reduce funds available for exploration with the result that
    depleted reserves may not be replaced; and

•

reduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can
    no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices.

Also see the discussion in Item 1, Business, Gold or Copper
    Price.

We may be
    unable to replace gold and copper reserves as they become
    depleted.

Gold and copper producers must continually replace reserves
    depleted by production to maintain production levels over the
    long term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted
    reserves can be replaced in several ways, including by expanding
    known ore bodies, by locating new deposits, or by acquiring
    interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly
    speculative in nature, involves many risks and frequently is
    unproductive. Our current or future exploration programs may not
    result in new mineral producing operations. Even if significant
    mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years
    from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of
    production, during which time the economic feasibility of
    production may change.

We may consider, from time to time, the acquisition of ore
    reserves related to development properties and operating mines.
    Such acquisitions are typically based on an analysis of a
    variety of factors including historical operating results,
    estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of ore
    reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash
    and other operating costs. Other factors that affect our
    decision to make any such acquisitions may also include our
    assumptions for future gold or copper prices or other mineral
    prices and the projected economic returns and evaluations of
    existing or potential liabilities associated with the property
    and its operations and projections of how these may change in
    the future. In addition, in connection with future acquisitions
    we may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties and
    which may contain information or data that we are unable to
    independently verify or confirm. Other than historical operating
    results, all of these factors are uncertain and may have an
    impact on our revenue, our cash and other operating issues, as
    well as contributing to the uncertainties related to the process
    used to estimate ore reserves. In addition, there may be intense
    competition for the acquisition of attractive mining properties.



As a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs and
    any acquisitions which we may pursue may not result in the
    expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore
    reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and
    financial position.

Estimates of
    proven and probable reserves and non reserve mineralization are
    uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may
    vary from our estimates.

The reserves stated in this report represent the amount of gold
    and copper that we estimated, at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, could be economically and legally extracted or produced at
    the time of the reserve determination. Estimates of proven and
    probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such
    estimates are, to a large extent, based on the prices of gold
    and copper and interpretations of geologic data obtained from
    drill holes and other exploration techniques. Producers use
    feasibility studies to derive estimates of capital and operating
    costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be
    mined and processed, the predicted configuration of the ore
    body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, the costs
    of comparable facilities, the costs of operating and processing
    equipment and other factors. Actual operating costs and economic
    returns on projects may differ significantly from original
    estimates. Further, it may take many years from the initial
    phases of exploration until commencement of production, during
    which time, the economic feasibility of production may change.

In addition, if the price of gold or copper declines from recent
    levels, if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease,
    or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, we
    can offer no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will
    be realized or that mineral reserves as currently reported can
    be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain
    of our ore reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately
    lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported reserves.
    Consequently, if our actual mineral reserves and resources are
    less than current estimates, our business, prospects, results of
    operations and financial position may be materially impaired.

Increased
    operating costs could affect our profitability.

Costs at any particular mining location are subject to variation
    due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grade, changing
    metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the
    physical shape and location of the ore body. In addition, costs
    are affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel,
    electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and
    concrete. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile
    price movements, including increases that could make production
    at certain operations less profitable and changes in laws and
    regulations affecting their price, use and transport. Reported
    costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. A
    material increase in costs at any significant location could
    have a significant effect on our profitability and operating
    cash flow.

We could have significant increases in capital and operating
    costs over the next several years in connection with the
    development of new projects in challenging jurisdictions and in
    sustaining existing operations. Costs associated with capital
    expenditures have escalated on an industry-wide basis over the
    last several years, as a result of factors beyond our control,
    including the prices of oil, steel and other commodities and
    labor. Increased costs for capital expenditures may have an
    adverse effect on the profitability of existing operations and
    economic returns anticipated from new projects.

Estimates
    relating to new development projects are uncertain and we may
    incur higher costs and lower economic returns than
    estimated.

Mine development projects typically require a number of years
    and significant expenditures during the development phase before
    production is possible. Such projects could experience
    unexpected problems and delays during development, construction
    and mine

start-up.



Our decision to develop a project is typically based on the
    results of feasibility studies, which estimate the anticipated
    economic returns of a project. The actual project profitability
    or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a
    result of any of the following factors, among others:

•

changes in tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of
    ore to be mined and processed;

•

higher input commodity and labor costs;

•

the quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were
    made;

•

adverse geotechnical conditions;

•

availability of adequate labor force and supply and cost of
    water and power;

•

fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates;

•

availability and terms of financing;

•

delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or
    changes in the laws and regulations related to those permits;

•

weather or severe climate impacts; and

•

potential delays relating to social and community issues.

Our future development activities may not result in the
    expansion or replacement of current production with new
    production, or one or more of these new production sites or
    facilities may be less profitable than currently anticipated or
    may not be profitable at all, any of which could have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
    position.

We may
    experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards
    and uncertainties associated with mining.

The exploration for natural resources and the development and
    production of mining operations are activities that involve a
    high level of uncertainty. These can be difficult to predict and
    are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control.
    These factors include, but are not limited to:

•

environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, pollutants
    or hazardous chemicals;

•

industrial accidents, including in connection with the operation
    of mining transportation equipment and accidents associated with
    the preparation and ignition of large-scale blasting operations,
    milling equipment and conveyor systems;

•

underground fires or floods;

•

unexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in
    mineral or gaseous form);

•

ground and water conditions;

•

fall-of-ground

accidents in underground operations;

•

failure of mining pit slopes and tailings dam walls;

•

seismic activity; and

•

other natural phenomena, such as lightning, cyclonic or tropical
    storms, floods or other inclement weather conditions.

The occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with
    our exploration activities and development and production of
    mining operations may result in the death of, or personal injury
    to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of
    mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties
    or production facilities, monetary losses, deferral or
    unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage
    and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely
    affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of
    operations and financial position.



Shortages of
    critical parts, equipment and skilled labor may adversely affect
    our operations and development projects.

The mining industry has been impacted by increased demand for
    critical resources such as input commodities, drilling
    equipment, tires and skilled labor. These shortages have, at
    times, impacted the efficiency of our operations, and resulted
    in cost increases and delays in construction of projects;
    thereby impacting operating costs, capital expenditures and
    production and construction schedules.

Mining
    companies are increasingly required to consider and provide
    benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate,
    and are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety
    laws and regulations.

As a result of public concern about the real or perceived
    detrimental effects of economic globalization and global climate
    impacts, businesses generally and large multinational
    corporations in natural resources industries, such as Newmont,
    in particular, face increasing public scrutiny of their
    activities. These businesses are under pressure to demonstrate
    that, as they seek to generate satisfactory returns on
    investment to shareholders, other stakeholders, including
    employees, governments, communities surrounding operations and
    the countries in which they operate, benefit and will continue
    to benefit from their commercial activities. Such pressures tend
    to be particularly focused on companies whose activities are
    perceived to have a high impact on their social and physical
    environment. The potential consequences of these pressures
    include reputational damage, legal suits and social investment
    obligations.

In addition, our ability to successfully obtain key permits and
    approvals to explore for, develop and operate mines and to
    successfully operate in communities around the world will likely
    depend on our ability to develop, operate and close mines in a
    manner that is consistent with the creation of social and
    economic benefits in the surrounding communities. Our ability to
    obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in
    particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or
    perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or
    those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human
    health and safety of communities in which we operate. Delays in
    obtaining or failure to obtain government permits and approvals
    may adversely affect our operations, including our ability to
    explore or develop properties, commence production or continue
    operations. Key permits and approvals may be revoked or
    suspended or may be varied in a manner that adversely affects
    our operations, including our ability to explore or develop
    properties, commence production or continue operations.

Our exploration, development, mining and processing operations
    are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing worker
    health and safety and the protection of the environment, which
    generally apply to air and water quality, protection of
    protected species, hazardous waste management and reclamation.
    We have made, and expect to make in the future, significant
    expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations.
    Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial
    costs and burdens, and can cause delays in obtaining, or failure
    to obtain, government permits and approvals which may adversely
    impact our operations.

Future changes in applicable laws, regulations and permits or
    changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could
    substantially increase costs to achieve compliance, lead to the
    revocation of existing or future exploration or mining rights or
    otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations
    and financial position. For instance, the operation of our mines
    in the United States is subject to regulation by the Federal
    Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under
    the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine
    Act”). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and
    issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation
    has occurred under the Mine Act. If such inspections result in
    an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines, penalties or
    sanctions and our mining operations could be subject to
    temporary or extended closures, which could have an adverse
    effect on our results of operations and financial position.
    Following passage of The Mine Improvement and New Emergency
    Response Act of 2006, MSHA significantly increased the



numbers of citations and orders charged against mining
    operations. The dollar penalties assessed for citations issued
    has also increased in recent years.

In addition, the United States Environmental Protection Agency
    (“EPA”) is currently seeking to regulate as hazardous
    waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
    (“RCRA”) secondary streams derived from core
    beneficiation operations, such as our roasting operations, in
    Nevada. Historically, such streams have been considered exempt
    from RCRA and have been regulated by the Nevada Division of
    Environmental Protection. The regulation of these streams as
    hazardous waste under RCRA could subject us to civil and
    criminal penalties for past practices and require us to incur
    substantial future costs to modify our waste water collection
    systems and retrofit our tailings storage facilities at our
    Nevada mining operations, which could have an adverse effect on
    our results of operations and financial position.

Increased global attention or regulation on water quality
    discharge, such as recently enacted water quality legislation
    applicable to our operations in Peru, and on restricting or
    prohibiting the use of cyanide and other hazardous substances in
    processing activities could similarly have an adverse impact on
    our results of operations and financial position due to
    increased compliance and input costs.

We have implemented a management system designed to promote
    continuous improvement in health and safety, environmental
    performance and community relations. However, our ability to
    operate, and thus, our results of operations and our financial
    position, could be adversely affected by accidents or events
    detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the health and
    safety of our employees, the environment or the communities in
    which we operate.

Mine closure
    and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed
    the provisions we have made.

Natural resource companies are required to close their
    operations and rehabilitate the lands that they mine in
    accordance with a variety of environmental laws and regulations.
    Estimates of the total ultimate closure and rehabilitation costs
    for gold and copper mining operations are significant and based
    principally on current legal and regulatory requirements and
    mine closure plans that may change materially. For example, we
    have conducted extensive remediation work at two inactive sites
    in the United States. We are conducting mill remediation
    activities at a third site in the United States, an inactive
    uranium mine and mill formerly operated by a subsidiary of
    Newmont, but remediation at the mine is subject to dispute. In
    late 2008, the EPA issued an order regarding water management at
    the mine. The environmental standards that may ultimately be
    imposed at this site remain uncertain and a risk exists that the
    costs of remediation may exceed the financial accruals that have
    been made for such remediation by a material amount.

Any underestimated or unanticipated rehabilitation costs could
    materially affect our financial position, results of operations
    and cash flows. Environmental liabilities are accrued when they
    become known, are probable and can be reasonably estimated.
    Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes
    known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased,
    the amount of that liability and additional cost will be
    recorded at that time and could materially reduce our
    consolidated net income attributable to Newmont stockholders in
    the related period. In addition, regulators are increasingly
    requesting security in the form of cash collateral, credit,
    trust arrangements or guarantees to secure the performance of
    environmental obligations, which could have an adverse effect on
    our financial position. For a more detailed discussion of
    potential environmental liabilities, see the discussion in
    Environmental Matters, Note 31 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

The laws and regulations governing mine closure and remediation
    in a particular jurisdiction are subject to review at any time
    and may be amended to impose additional requirements and
    conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental
    liabilities to be underestimated and could materially affect our
    financial position or results of operations.



Regulations
    and pending legislation governing issues involving climate
    change could result in increased operating costs which could
    have a material adverse effect on our business.

Energy is a significant input to our mining operations, with our
    principal energy sources being electricity, purchased petroleum
    products, natural gas and coal.

A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced
    or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the
    potential impacts of climate change that are viewed as the
    result of emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels.
    The December 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which ends in 2012,
    established a set of greenhouse gas emission targets for
    developed countries that have ratified the Protocol, which
    include Ghana, Australia and Peru. The Conference of Parties 15
    (“COP15”) of the United Nations Framework Convention
    on Climate Change held in Copenhagen, Denmark in December 2009
    was to determine the path forward after the Kyoto Protocol ends.
    COP15 resulted in the Copenhagen Accord (the
    “Accord”), a non-binding document calling for
    economy-wide emissions targets for 2020. Prior to the
    January 31, 2010 deadline, the United States, Australia,
    New Zealand, Indonesia, Ghana and Peru re-affirmed their
    commitment to the Accord. The U.S. Congress and several
    U.S. states have initiated legislation regarding climate
    change that will affect energy prices and demand for carbon
    intensive products. In December 2009, the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an endangerment
    finding under the U.S. Clean Air Act that current and
    projected concentrations of certain mixed greenhouse gases,
    including carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere threaten the public
    health and welfare. It is possible that proposed regulation may
    be promulgated in the United States to address the concerns
    raised by such endangerment finding. Additionally, the
    Australian Government may introduce legislation authorizing a
    national emissions trading scheme and mandatory renewable energy
    targets.

Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change
    could impose increased costs on us, our venture partners and our
    suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment,
    environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply
    with such regulations. Until the timing, scope and extent of any
    future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on
    our financial condition, financial position, results of
    operations and ability to compete.

The potential physical impacts of climate change on our
    operations are highly uncertain, and would be particular to the
    geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may
    include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities,
    water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures.
    These impacts may adversely impact the cost, production and
    financial performance of our operations.

Our operations
    are subject to risks of doing business.

Exploration, development, production and mine closure activities
    are subject to political, economic and other risks of doing
    business, including:

•

disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that
    are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the
    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;

•

changes in laws or regulations;

•

royalty and tax increases or claims, including retroactive
    increases and claims and requests to renegotiate terms of
    existing royalties and taxes, by governmental entities,
    including such increases, claims

and/or

requests by the governments of Ghana, Indonesia, Australia,
    Peru, the United States and the State of Nevada;

•

increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to
    requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of
    the country in which a particular operation is located;

•

delays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain,
    maintain or renew, necessary governmental permits and approvals;



•

claims for increased mineral royalties or ownership interests by
    local or indigenous communities;

•

expropriation or nationalization of property;

•

currency fluctuations, particularly in countries with high
    inflation;

•

foreign exchange controls;

•

restrictions on the ability of local operating companies to sell
    gold offshore for U.S. dollars, or on the ability of such
    companies to hold U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies
    in offshore bank accounts;

•

import and export regulations, including restrictions on the
    export of gold;

•

increases in costs relating to, or restrictions or prohibitions
    on, the use of ports for concentrate storage and shipping,
    particularly in relation to our Boddington and Batu Hijau
    operations where use of alternative ports is not currently
    economically feasible;

•

restrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore or to
    otherwise repatriate funds;

•

risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla
    activities, insurrection and terrorism;

•

risk of loss due to criminal activities such as trespass,
    illegal mining, theft and vandalism;

•

risk of loss due to disease and other potential endemic health
    issues;

•

disadvantages relating to submission to the jurisdiction of
    foreign courts or arbitration panels or enforcement or appeals
    of judgments at foreign courts or arbitration panels against a
    sovereign nation within its own territory; and

•

other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in
    which our operations are conducted, including risks inherent in
    contracts with government owned entities such as unilateral
    cancellation or renegotiation of contracts, licenses or other
    mining rights.

Consequently, our exploration, development and production
    activities may be affected by these and other factors, many of
    which are beyond our control, some of which could materially
    adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.

Our Batu Hijau
    operation in Indonesia is subject to political and economic
    risks.

We have a substantial investment in Indonesia, a nation that
    since 1997 has undergone financial crises and devaluation of its
    currency, outbreaks of political and religious violence and acts
    of terrorism, changes in national leadership, and the secession
    of East Timor, one of its former provinces. These factors
    heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy
    toward foreign investors, which in turn could result in
    unilateral modification of concessions or contracts, increased
    taxation, denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation
    of assets.

Presidential and parliamentary elections took place in July
    2009, and although the president was re-elected, new ministers
    or members of parliament may have different (and potentially
    more negative) views relating to mining in general, and our
    assets and operations in particular, and may have a preference
    for national mining companies to own Indonesia’s mineral
    assets.

Violence committed by radical elements in Indonesia and other
    countries, and the presence or increase of U.S. forces in
    Iraq and Afghanistan, may increase the risk that operations
    owned by U.S. companies will be the target of violence. If
    our Batu Hijau operation were so targeted it could have an
    adverse effect on our business.



Our Batu Hijau
    operation in Indonesia may be adversely affected by a delay in
    receiving certain permit renewals.

Over the years, we are required to apply for renewals of certain
    key permits related to Batu Hijau. PTNNT, the entity operating
    Batu Hijau, employs a submarine tailings disposal
    (“STD”) system. The STD system is operated pursuant to
    a permit from the government of Indonesia that is up for renewal
    in May 2011, and is a key requirement to continue normal
    operations at Batu Hijau. A delay or failure to receive a STD
    permit renewal could adversely impact Batu Hijau operations and
    may adversely impact our future operating and financial results.

Our ownership
    interest in Batu Hijau has been reduced in accordance with the
    Contract of Work issued by the Indonesian Government and future
    reductions in our interest in PTNNT may result in our loss of
    control over the Batu Hijau operations.

We operate Batu Hijau and currently have a 31.5% direct
    ownership interest, held through the Nusa Tenggara Partnership
    (“NTP”) with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of
    Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTP and a Sumitomo affiliate
    holds the remaining 43.75%. In December 2009, the Company
    entered into a transaction with P.T. Pukuafu Indah
    (“PTPI”), an unrelated noncontrolling partner of
    PTNNT, whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTPI in
    exchange for a pledge of the noncontrolling partner’s 20%
    share of PTNNT dividends, net of withholding tax, and the
    assignment of certain voting rights and obligations to the
    Company. On June 25, 2010, PTPI completed the sale of
    approximately a 2.2% interest in PTNNT to PT Indonesia Masbaga
    Investama (“PTIMI”) and the Company entered into a
    transaction with PTIMI, whereby we agreed to advance certain
    funds to PTIMI in exchange for a pledge of PTIMI’s 2.2%
    share of PTNNT dividends, net of withholding tax, and the
    assignment of certain voting rights and obligations to the
    Company. Based on the above transactions, the Company recognized
    an additional 17% effective economic interest in PTNNT. Combined
    with the Company’s 56.25% ownership in NTP, Newmont has a
    48.5% effective economic interest in PTNNT and continues to
    consolidate Batu Hijau in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Under the Contract of Work executed in 1986 between the
    Indonesian government and PTNNT, 51% of PTNNT’s shares must
    be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or,
    second, to Indonesian nationals by March 31, 2010. Pursuant
    to this divestiture provision, the ownership interest in the
    Batu Hijau mine’s production, assets and proven and
    probable equity reserves may be reduced in the future to as low
    as 27.56% and ownership interest of NTP in PTNNT could be
    reduced to 49%, thus reducing our ability to control the
    operation at Batu Hijau. Loss of control over PTNNT operations
    may result in our deconsolidation of PTNNT for accounting
    purposes, which would reduce our reported consolidated sales,
    total assets and operating cash flows. See Note 31 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the
    PTNNT share divestiture.

Furthermore, as part of the negotiation of the share
    divestitures with PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”),
    the consortium of Indonesian regional and local governments and
    an unrelated Indonesian company that purchased such shares, the
    parties executed an operating agreement under which each
    recognizes the right of NTP to operate Batu Hijau and binds the
    parties to adhere to NTP’s standards for safety,
    environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The
    operating agreement remains in effect for so long as NTP owns
    more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the operating agreement
    terminates, we will likely lose effective control over the
    operations of Batu Hijau and will be at risk for operations
    conducted in a manner that could potentially reduce the value of
    PTNNT or results in safety, environmental or social standards
    below those adhered to by NTP.



The Contract
    of Work has been and may continue to be the subject of dispute
    or legal review and is subject to termination by the Indonesian
    government if we do not comply with our obligations, which would
    result in loss of all or much of the value of Batu
    Hijau.

The divestiture provisions of the Contract of Work have been the
    subject of dispute. In 2008, the Department of Energy and
    Mineral Resources of the Indonesian government (the
    “DEMR”) alleged that PTNNT was in breach of its
    divestiture requirements under the Contract of Work and
    threatened to terminate the Contract of Work if PTNNT did not
    agree to divest shares in accordance with the direction of the
    DEMR. The matter was resolved by an international arbitration
    panel in March 2009. The arbitration decision led to NTP
    divesting 24% of PTNNT’s shares to PTMDB, the party
    nominated by the DEMR. NTP is in the concluding stages of
    working with the DEMR to divest the final 7% interest in PTNNT
    required to be divested under the Contract of Work. Following
    NTP’s divestiture of 24% of PTNNT’s shares to PTMDB,
    PTPI filed lawsuits in the South Jakarta District Court
    contending that it owns, or has rights to own, the shares in
    PTNNT that were divested by NTP to fulfill the requirements of
    the Contract of Work and the March 2009 arbitration award. In
    November 2010, the South Jakarta District Court issued a ruling
    with respect to one of the lawsuits, finding that PTPI has an
    entitlement to receive the full 31% interest in PTNNT required
    to be divested under the Contract of Work and awarding PTPI
    monetary damages of approximately $27. NTP has appealed the
    South Jakarta District Court ruling, a ruling which we believe
    contradicts both the Contract of Work and the March 2009
    arbitration. Although we are confident that the appellate courts
    will reverse the South Jakarta District Court ruling, there can
    be no assurance that NTP will prevail in this litigation.

Although the Indonesian government has acknowledged that PTNNT
    is currently in compliance with the Contract of Work, future
    disputes may arise under the Contract of Work. Moreover, there
    have been statements, from time to time, by some within the
    Indonesian government who advocate elimination of Contracts of
    Work and who may try to instigate future disputes surrounding
    the Contract of Work, particularly given that Batu Hijau is one
    of the largest businesses within the country. Although any
    dispute under the Contract of Work is subject to international
    arbitration, there can be no assurance that we would prevail in
    any such dispute and any termination of the Contract of Work
    could result in substantial diminution in the value of our
    interests in PTNNT. See Note 31 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for more information about the disputes
    involving the Contract of Work.

In January 2009, the Indonesian Government passed a new mining
    law. While the law preserves the right PTNNT to operate our Batu
    Hijau operations pursuant to the Contract of Work, no assurances
    can be provided that the Indonesian government will not seek to
    renegotiate certain provisions of the Contract of Work to
    conform to certain provisions of the new mining law, which could
    include requests for, among other things, higher royalty rates.

Our operations
    in Peru are subject to political risks.

During the last several years, Yanacocha, in which we own a
    51.35% interest, has been the target of numerous local political
    protests, some of which blocked the road between the Yanacocha
    mine complex and the City of Cajamarca in Peru. We cannot
    predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur
    and the recurrence of significant community opposition or
    protests could adversely affect Yanacocha’s assets and
    operations. In 2008, 2009, 2010 and thus far in 2011, no
    material roadblocks or protests occurred involving Yanacocha.

In December 2006, Yanacocha, along with other mining companies
    in Peru, entered into a five-year agreement with the central
    government to contribute 3.75% of net profits to fund social
    development projects. Although the current government has
    generally taken positions promoting private investment, we
    cannot predict future government positions on foreign
    investment, mining concessions, land tenure, environmental
    regulation or taxation. National elections are scheduled in
    April 2011 and a change in government positions on these issues
    could adversely affect Yanacocha’s assets and operations,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations and financial position.



Our Company
    and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical
    challenges, which could adversely impact our production and
    profitability.

Newmont and the mining industry are facing continued
    geotechnical challenges due to the older age of certain of our
    mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex
    deposits. This leads to higher pit walls, more complex
    underground environments and increased exposure to geotechnical
    instability and hydrological impacts. As our operations are
    maturing, the open pits at many of our sites are getting deeper
    and we have experienced certain geotechnical failures at some of
    our mines, including, without limitation, in Indonesia at the
    Batu Hijau open-pit mine and at our operations in Nevada and
    Peru. In January 2010, our affiliate, PTNNT, experienced a
    geotechnical failure on a portion of the southeast wall causing
    a slide, which regrettably resulted in a fatality of one of the
    mine employees. Operations were temporarily suspended to conduct
    investigations and operations have since recommenced.

No absolute assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse
    geotechnical and hydrological conditions, such as landslides and
    pit wall failures, will not occur in the future or that such
    events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical instabilities
    can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and
    hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and
    considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods,
    mudslides, wall instability, and seismic activity, which may
    result in slippage of material.

Geotechnical failures could result in limited or restricted
    access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government
    investigations, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs,
    loss of ore and other impacts, which could cause one or more of
    our projects to be less profitable than currently anticipated
    and could result in a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations and financial position.

Currency
    fluctuations may affect our costs.

Currency fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur at our
    operations. Gold and copper is sold throughout the world based
    principally on the U.S. dollar price, but a portion of our
    operating expenses are incurred in local currencies. The
    appreciation of those local currencies against the
    U.S. dollar increases our costs of production in
    U.S. dollar terms at mines located outside the
    United States.

The foreign currency that primarily impacts our results of
    operations is the Australian dollar. We estimate that every
    $0.10 increase in U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange
    rate increases annually the U.S. dollar

Costs applicable
    to sales

by approximately $79 for each ounce of gold
    produced from operations in Australia before taking into account
    the impact of currency hedging. From December 31, 2009 to
    December 31, 2010, the Australian dollar appreciated by
    approximately $0.12 per U.S. dollar, or approximately 13%.
    We hedge up to 90% of our future forecasted Australian dollar
    denominated operating expenditures to reduce the variability of
    our Australian dollar exposure. At December 31, 2010 we
    have hedged 72%, 45%, 22%, 17% and 8% of our forecasted
    Australian denominated operating costs in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014
    and 2015, respectively. Our Australian dollar derivative
    programs will limit the benefit to the Company of future
    decreases, if any, in the U.S. dollar/Australian dollar
    exchange rates. For additional information, see Item 7,
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Results of
    Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, below.
    For a more detailed description of how currency exchange rates
    may affect costs, see discussion in Foreign Currency in
    Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions About
    Market Risk.

Our business
    requires substantial capital investment and we may be unable to
    raise additional funding on favorable terms.

The construction and operation of potential future projects
    including the Akyem project in Ghana, the Conga project in Peru,
    the Hope Bay project in Nunavut, Canada, and various exploration
    projects will require significant funding. Our operating cash
    flow and other sources of funding may become insufficient to
    meet all of these requirements, depending on the timing and
    costs of development of these and other projects. As a result,
    new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding



requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business
    activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service
    significant new sources of capital will be a function of
    macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices, our
    operational performance and our current cash flow and debt
    position, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and
    copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges,
    or a further dislocation in the financial markets as experienced
    in recent years, our ability to pursue new business
    opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our
    ongoing operations, retire or service all of our outstanding
    debt and pay dividends could be significantly constrained.

Any downgrade
    in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could
    increase our future borrowing costs and adversely affect the
    availability of new financing.

At December 31, 2010 Standard & Poor’s
    Rating Services rated Newmont Mining Corporation BBB+, with a
    stable outlook, and Moody’s Investors Service rated Newmont
    Mining Corporation Baa1 with a stable outlook. There can be no
    assurance that any rating assigned will remain for any given
    period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that
    rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to
    the basis of the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain
    our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable
    to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects
    deteriorate, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating
    agencies, which could adversely affect the value of our
    outstanding securities, our existing debt and our ability to
    obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, and increase
    our borrowing costs, which in turn could impair our results of
    operations and financial position.

To the extent
    that we seek to expand our operations and increase our reserves
    through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing
    acquisitions or integrating acquired operations.

From time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective
    acquisitions in order to expand our operations and reported
    reserves. The success of any acquisition would depend on a
    number of factors, including, but not limited to:

•

identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating
    acceptable terms;

•

obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially
    the Company’s shareholders;

•

maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding
    distraction of management during the process of integrating the
    acquired business;

•

implementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at
    the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing
    liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; and

•

to the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which
    we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations
    and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any
    acquisitions successfully, or that any acquisition will achieve
    the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any
    material problems that we encounter in connection with such an
    acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations and financial position.

Our operations
    may be adversely affected by energy shortages.

Our mining operations and development projects require
    significant amounts of energy. Our principal energy sources are
    electricity, purchased petroleum products, natural gas and coal.
    Some of our operations are in remote locations requiring long
    distance transmission of power, and in some locations we compete
    with other companies for access to third party power generators
    or electrical supply networks. A disruption in the transmission
    of energy, inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the
    termination of any of our energy supply contracts could
    interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations.

We have periodically experienced power shortages in Ghana
    resulting primarily from drought, increasing demands for
    electricity and insufficient hydroelectric or other generating
    capacity which



caused curtailment of production at our Ahafo operations. As a
    result of the mining industry’s agreement to construct and
    install an 80 mega-watt power plant during 2007, the Ghanaian
    government has agreed, if required, to curtail power consumption
    as a result of power shortages and to distribute available power
    proportionately between participating mines and other industrial
    and commercial users. The need to use alternative sources of
    power may result in higher than anticipated costs, which will
    affect operating costs. Continued power shortages and increased
    costs may adversely affect our results of operations and
    financial position.

Continuation
    of our mining production is dependent on the availability of
    sufficient water supplies to support our mining
    operations.

Our mining operations require significant quantities of water
    for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Our
    operations in North and South America and Australia are in areas
    where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing
    access to water is significant. Continuous production at our
    mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights
    and claims and defeat claims adverse to our current water uses
    in legal proceedings. Although each of our operations currently
    has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational
    demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or
    future legal proceedings relating to our water rights, claims
    and uses. The loss of some or all water rights for any of our
    mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we
    have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining
    production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion
    opportunities. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some
    jurisdictions in which we operate which could limit our access
    to sufficient water resources in our operations, thus adversely
    affecting our operations.

The occurrence
    of events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flow
    and overall profitability.

We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against certain
    risks related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in
    amounts that we believe are reasonable depending upon the
    circumstances surrounding each identified risk. However, we may
    elect not to have insurance for certain risks because of the
    high premiums associated with insuring those risks or for
    various other reasons; in other cases, insurance may not be
    available for certain risks. Some concern always exists with
    respect to investments in parts of the world where civil unrest,
    war, nationalist movements, political violence or economic
    crises are possible. These countries may also pose heightened
    risks of expropriation of assets, business interruption,
    increased taxation or unilateral modification of concessions and
    contracts. We do not maintain insurance policies against
    political risk. Occurrence of events for which we are not
    insured may affect our results of operations and financial
    position.

Our business
    depends on good relations with our employees.

Production at our mines is dependent upon the efforts of our
    employees and, consequently, our maintenance of good
    relationships with our employees. Due to union activities or
    other employee actions, we could experience labor disputes, work
    stoppages or other disruptions in production that could
    adversely affect us. At December 31, 2010 union represented
    employees constituted approximately 48% of our worldwide work
    force. There can be no assurance that any future disputes will
    be resolved without disruptions to operations.

We rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of
    our operations and construction projects.

A significant portion of our operations and construction
    projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by
    contractors. As a result, our operations are subject to a number
    of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:

•

negotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;

•

the inability to replace a contractor and its operating
    equipment in the event that either party terminates the
    agreement;

•

reduced control over those aspects of operations which are the
    responsibility of the contractor;



•

failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;

•

interruption of operations or increased costs in the event that
    a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other
    unforeseen events;

•

failure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and
    regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for
    such compliance; and

•

problems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor
    unrest or other employment issues.

In addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result
    of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more
    of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations
    and financial position.

We are subject
    to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the
    future.

We are currently, or may in the future become, subject to
    litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other
    parties. If decided adversely to Newmont, these legal
    proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the
    future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending
    litigation, see Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we
    may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts
    or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting
    foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels
    in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and
    the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign
    courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our
    results of operations and financial position.

Title to some
    of our properties may be defective or challenged.

Although we have conducted title reviews of our properties,
    title review does not necessarily preclude third parties from
    challenging our title or related property rights. While we
    believe that we have satisfactory title to our properties, some
    titles may be defective or subject to challenge. In addition,
    certain of our Australian properties could be subject to native
    title or traditional landowner claims, and our ability to use
    these properties is dependent on agreements with traditional
    owners of the properties. For information regarding native title
    or traditional landowner claims, see the discussion under the
    Australia/New Zealand section of Item 2, Properties, below.

Competition
    from other natural resource companies may harm our
    business.

We compete with other natural resource companies to attract and
    retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other
    employees. We also compete with other natural resource companies
    for specialized equipment, components and supplies, such as
    drill rigs, necessary for exploration and development, as well
    as for rights to mine properties containing gold, copper and
    other minerals. We may be unable to continue to attract and
    retain skilled and experienced employees, to obtain the services
    of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or
    supplies, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties.

Our ability to
    recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on
    future cash flows and taxable income.

We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax
    assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than
    not of being realized, otherwise, a valuation allowance is
    applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the
    recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to
    make significant estimates related to expectations of future
    taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on
    forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of
    existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that
    future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from
    estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could
    be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could
    limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented
    by our deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2010 the
    Company’s current and long-term deferred tax assets were
    $177 and $1,437, respectively.



Returns for
    investments in pension plans are uncertain.

We maintain pension plans for certain employees which provide
    for specified payments after retirement. The ability of the
    pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our
    funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the
    plans. Returns, if any, on investments are subject to
    fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions.
    A sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could
    require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than
    anticipated. During the second half of 2008 and early 2009,
    market conditions caused the value of the investments in our
    pension plans to decrease significantly. As a result, we
    contributed $161 and $55 to the pension plans in 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. If future plan investment returns are not
    sufficient, we may be required to increase the amount of future
    cash contributions. For a more detailed discussion of the
    funding status and expected benefit payments to plan
    participants, see the discussion in Employee Related Benefits,
    Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Nevada, USA.

We have been mining gold in
    Nevada since 1965. Nevada operations include Carlin, located
    west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the
    Carlin Trend, the Phoenix mine, located 10 miles south of
    Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately
    15 miles north of Golconda, and the Midas mine near the
    town of the same name. We also participate in the Turquoise
    Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold
    Corporation (“Barrick”), which utilizes mill capacity
    at Twin Creeks.



Gold production from Nevada was approximately 1.7 million
    ounces for 2010 with ore mined from eight open pit and six
    underground mines. At December 31, 2010, we reported
    31.2 million ounces of gold reserves in Nevada, with 81% of
    those ounces in open pit mines and 19% in underground mines. We
    are pursuing several development opportunities in Nevada with
    significant reserve expansion potential.

The Nevada operations produce gold from a variety of ore types
    requiring different processing techniques depending on economic
    and metallurgical characteristics. To ensure the best use of
    processing capacity, we use a linear programming model to guide
    the flow of both mining sequence selection and routing of ore
    streams to various plants. Refractory ores, which require more
    complex, higher cost processing methods, generated 79% of
    Nevada’s gold production in 2010, compared with 77% in
    2009, and 72% in 2008. With respect to remaining reserves, we
    estimate that approximately 85% are refractory ores and 15% are
    oxide ores. Higher-grade oxide ores are processed by
    conventional milling and cyanide leaching at Carlin (Mill
    5) and Twin Creeks (Juniper). Lower-grade material with
    suitable cyanide solubility is treated on heap leach pads at
    Carlin and Twin Creeks. Higher-grade refractory ores are
    processed through either a roaster at Carlin (Mill 6) or
    autoclaves at Twin Creeks (Sage). Lower-grade refractory ores
    are processed at Carlin by either bio-oxidation/flotation or
    direct flotation at Mill 5. Mill 5 flotation concentrates are
    then processed at the Carlin roaster or the Twin Creeks
    autoclaves and additional gold is recovered from the flotation
    tails by cyanide leaching. The Phoenix mill produces a gravity
    gold concentrate and a copper/gold flotation concentrate and
    recovers additional gold from cyanide leaching of the flotation
    tails. Ore from the Midas mine is processed by conventional
    milling and Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation. Activated carbon
    from the various leaching circuits is treated to produce gold
    ore at the Carlin or Twin Creeks refineries. Zinc precipitate at
    Midas is refined

on-site.

We own, or control through long-term mining leases and
    unpatented mining claims, all of the minerals and surface area
    within the boundaries of the present Nevada mining operations
    (except for the Turquoise Ridge joint venture described below).
    The long-term leases extend for at least the anticipated mine
    life of those deposits. With respect to a significant portion of
    the Gold Quarry mine at Carlin, we own a 10% undivided interest
    in the mineral rights and lease the remaining 90%, on which we
    pay a royalty equivalent to 18% of the mineral production. We
    wholly-own or control the remainder of the Gold Quarry mineral
    rights, in some cases subject to additional royalties. With
    respect to certain smaller deposits in Nevada, we are obligated
    to pay royalties on production to third parties that vary from
    1% to 8% of production.

In Nevada, mining taxes are assessed on up to 5% of net proceeds
    of a mine. Net proceeds are calculated as the excess of gross
    yield over direct costs. Gross yield is determined as the value
    received when minerals are sold, exchanged for anything of value
    or removed from the state. Direct costs generally include the
    costs to develop, extract, produce, transport, refine and market
    minerals.

We have a 25% interest in a joint venture with Barrick in the
    Turquoise Ridge mine. Newmont has an agreement to provide up to
    2,000 tons per day of milling capacity at Twin Creeks to the
    joint venture. Barrick is the operator of the joint venture.
    Gold production of 38,000 ounces in 2010, 39,000 ounces in 2009
    and 45,000 ounces in 2008 were attributable to Newmont, based on
    our 25% ownership interest.

We have an ore sale agreement with Yukon-Nevada Gold Corporation
    (“Yukon-Nevada”) to process the Company’s ore. We
    recognized attributable gold sales, net of treatment charges, of
    15,000 ounces in 2010, 700 ounces in 2009 and 8,000 ounces in
    2008, pursuant to this agreement. During 2008, Yukon-Nevada
    discontinued operations; however, during the second half of
    2009, they resumed operations on a limited basis.

Mexico.

We have a 44% interest in
    La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora
    desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which
    owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises open pit
    operations with

run-of-mine

heap leach processing. La Herradura produced 174,000
    attributable ounces of gold in 2010 and at December 31,
    2010 we reported 2.3 million ounces of gold reserves.

Hope Bay, Canada.

We own 100% of the Hope Bay
    project, a large undeveloped gold project in the Nunavut
    Territory of Canada. Hope Bay is an 80 kilometer district in the
    Canadian arctic and is one of the last known undeveloped
    greenstone belts in the world. The exploration success over the
    last few



years continues to confirm the district’s significant
    long-term potential. In 2010, we commenced an underground
    decline at the Doris North deposit and expect the Doris phase 1
    project to provide access for test stoping and development
    drilling, progressing to a construction decision by the end of
    2011.

South
    America

The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“MYSRL”)
    include the mining operations at Yanacocha and the Conga
    project. We hold a 51.35% interest in MYSRL with the remaining
    interests held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A.
    (“Buenaventura”) (43.65%) and the International
    Finance Corporation (5%).

MYSRL has mining rights with respect to a large land position
    consisting of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to
    MYSRL and a related entity. These mining concessions provide for
    both the right to explore and exploit. However, MYSRL must first
    obtain the respective exploration and exploitation permits,
    which are generally granted in due course. MYSRL may retain
    mining concessions indefinitely by paying annual fees and,
    during exploitation, complying with production obligations or
    paying assessed fines. Mining concessions are freely assignable
    or transferable. MYSRL, along with other mining companies in
    Peru, agreed with the central government in December 2006 to
    contribute 3.75% of its net profits to fund social development
    projects for a period of five years.

Yanacocha, Peru.

Yanacocha is located
    approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and
    30 miles (48 kilometers) north of the city of Cajamarca, in
    Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993 and currently has three
    active open pit mines, Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua and
    Chaquicocha. Reclamation

and/or

backfilling activities at Carachugo, San José and
    Maqui Maqui are currently underway. Yanacocha has four leach
    pads, three processing facilities, and one mill, which began
    commercial production in the second quarter of 2008.
    Yanacocha’s gold production for 2010 was 1.5 million
    ounces (750,000 attributable ounces) and at December 31,
    2010 we reported 5.0 million ounces of gold reserves.

Conga, Peru.

The Conga project is located
    within close proximity of existing operations at Yanacocha.
    Feasibility studies on our preferred development option were
    completed in late 2009 and we continue to progress into the
    development stage with an emphasis on project engineering and
    obtaining all required permits. In 2010, we selected and
    mobilized the project engineering procurement and construction
    contractor. In October 2010, the project’s Environmental
    Impact Assessment was approved by the Peruvian authorities. A
    construction decision is expected in the first half of 2011. If
    all permits are secured, the commencement of production is
    expected in late 2014 or early 2015. At December 31, 2010
    we reported 6.1 million ounces of gold reserves and
    1,660 million pounds of copper reserves at Conga.

La Zanja, Peru.

Newmont holds a 46.94%
    interest in La Zanja, a gold project near the city of
    Cajamarca, Peru. The remaining interests are held by
    Buenaventura. The mine commenced operations in September 2010
    and is operated by Buenaventura. The site will consist of two
    small open pits and one oxide leach pad. La Zanja produced
    21,000 attributable gold ounces in 2010 and at December 31,
    2010 we reported 0.3 million ounces of gold reserves.

Australia/New Zealand.

In Australia, mineral
    exploration and mining titles are granted by the individual
    states or territories. Mineral titles may also be subject to
    native title legislation or, in the Northern Territory, to
    Aboriginal freehold title legislation that entitles indigenous
    persons to compensation calculated by reference to the gross
    value of production. In 1992, the High Court of Australia held
    that Aboriginal people who have maintained a continuing
    connection with their land according to their traditions and
    customs may hold certain rights in respect of the land (such
    rights commonly referred to as “native title”). Since
    the High Court’s decision, Australia has passed legislation
    providing for the protection of native title and established
    procedures for Aboriginal people to claim these rights. The fact
    that native title is claimed with respect to an area, however,
    does not necessarily mean that native title exists, and disputes
    may be resolved by the courts.



Generally, under native title legislation, all mining titles
    granted before January 1, 1994 are valid. Titles granted
    between January 1, 1994 and December 23, 1996,
    however, may be subject to invalidation if they were not
    obtained in compliance with applicable legislative procedures,
    though subsequent legislation has validated some of these
    titles. After December 23, 1996, mining titles over areas
    where native title is claimed to exist became subject to
    legislative processes that generally give native title claimants
    the “right to negotiate” with the title applicant for
    compensation and other conditions. Native title holders do not
    have a veto over the granting of mining titles, but if agreement
    cannot be reached, the matter can be referred to the National
    Native Title Tribunal for decision.

Native title claims are not expected to have a material adverse
    effect on any of our operations in Australia. The High Court of
    Australia determined in an August 2002 decision, which refined
    and narrowed the scope of native title, that native title does
    not subsist in minerals in Western Australia and that the rights
    granted under a mining title would, to the extent inconsistent
    with asserted native title rights, operate to extinguish those
    native title rights. Generally, native title is only an issue
    for Newmont with respect to obtaining new mineral titles or
    moving from one form of title to another, for example, from an
    exploration title to a mining title. In these cases, the
    requirements for negotiation and the possibility of paying
    compensation may result in delay and increased costs for mining
    in the affected areas. Similarly, the process of conducting
    Aboriginal heritage surveys to identify and locate areas or
    sites of Aboriginal cultural significance can result in
    additional costs and delay in gaining access to land for
    exploration and mining-related activities.

In Australia, various ad valorem royalties and taxes are paid to
    state and territorial governments, typically based on a
    percentage of gross revenues or earnings. Indigenous communities
    have negotiated royalty payments as a condition to granting
    access to areas where they have native title or other property
    rights.

Boddington.

Boddington (100% owned) is located
    81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Perth in Western
    Australia. Boddington has been wholly owned since June 2009 when
    Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold
    Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington
    poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial
    production in November 2009. Boddington produced 728,000 ounces
    of gold and 58 million pounds of copper in 2010 and at
    December 31, 2010 we reported 20.3 million ounces of
    gold reserves and 2,360 million pounds of copper reserves.

Kalgoorlie.

Kalgoorlie (50% owned) comprises
    the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit)
    and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder,
    373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth in Western
    Australia. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold
    Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick.
    The Super Pit is one of Australia’s largest gold mines in
    terms of gold production and annual mining volume. During 2010,
    the Kalgoorlie operations produced 754,000 ounces of gold
    (377,000 attributable ounces) and at December 31, 2010 we
    reported 3.8 million ounces of gold reserves.

Jundee.

Jundee (100% owned) is situated
    approximately 435 miles (700 kilometers) northeast of Perth
    in Western Australia. We mined ore at Jundee solely from
    underground sources in 2010, with mill feed supplemented from
    oxide stockpiles for blending purposes. Jundee produced 335,000
    ounces of gold in 2010 and at December 31, 2010 we reported
    0.8 million ounces of gold reserves.

Tanami.

Tanami (100% owned) includes the
    Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which
    are located in the Northern Territory approximately
    342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs,
    adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead Bullock Soak mining
    operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of
    the Granites. Operations are predominantly focused on the Callie
    underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed
    through the Granites treatment plant. During 2010, the Tanami
    operations produced 250,000 ounces of gold and at
    December 31, 2010 we reported 2.0 million ounces of
    gold reserves.



Waihi.

Waihi (100% owned) is located within
    the town of Waihi, approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers)
    southeast of Auckland, New Zealand and currently consists of the
    Favona underground deposit and the Martha open pit. The Waihi
    operation produced 108,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and at
    December 31, 2010 we reported 0.5 million ounces of
    gold reserves.

Duketon.

We have a 16.22% interest in Regis
    Resources Ltd. (“Regis”), a mineral company with
    significant gold and nickel exploration properties in Eastern
    Goldfields of Western Australia. Regis owns 100% of the Duketon
    gold project, which is located approximately 200 miles
    northeast of Kalgoorlie. Duketon commenced production in the
    third quarter of 2010 and produced 5,000 attributable ounces of
    gold in 2010. At December 31, 2010, we reported
    0.3 million ounces of gold reserves.

Batu Hijau, Indonesia.

Batu Hijau is located
    on the island of Sumbawa, approximately 950 miles (1,529
    kilometers) east of Jakarta. Batu Hijau is a large porphyry
    copper/gold deposit, which Newmont discovered in 1990.
    Development and construction activities began in 1997 and

start-up

occurred in late 1999. In 2010, Batu Hijau produced
    542 million pounds of copper (269 million attributable
    pounds) and 737,000 ounces of gold (364,000 attributable
    ounces). At December 31, 2010 we reported
    3,760 million pounds of copper reserves and
    3.7 million ounces of gold reserves at Batu Hijau.

We own 31.50% of the Batu Hijau mine through the Nusa Tenggara
    Partnership (“NTP”) with an affiliate of Sumitomo
    Corporation of Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTP and the
    Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTP in turn owns
    56% of PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”), the
    Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. Newmont entered into
    transactions with P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”) and
    PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama (“PTIMI”), unrelated
    noncontrolling partners of PTNNT, whereby we agreed to advance
    certain funds in exchange for a pledge of the shares as
    security, an assignment of the noncontrolling partners’
    combined 20% share of PTNNT dividends, net of withholding tax,
    and certain voting rights and obligations to the Company. As a
    result, PTPI and PTIMI were determined to be Variable Interest
    Entities (“VIEs”) as they have minimal attributable
    capital and certain voting rights and obligations to their 20%
    interest in PTNNT reside with Newmont. As a result, our
    effective economic interest in PTNNT increased by 17% to 48.50%
    at December 31, 2010. The remaining 24% interest in PTNNT
    is owned by PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”). We are
    currently the operator of Batu Hijau.

In Indonesia, rights are granted to foreign investors to explore
    for and to develop mineral resources within defined areas
    through Contracts of Work entered into with the Indonesian
    government. In 1986, PTNNT entered into a Contract of Work with
    the Indonesian government covering Batu Hijau, under which PTNNT
    was granted the exclusive right to explore in the contract area,
    construct any required facilities, extract and process the
    mineralized materials, and sell and export the minerals
    produced, subject to certain requirements including Indonesian
    government approvals and payment of royalties to the government.
    Under the Contract of Work, PTNNT has the right to continue
    operating the project for 30 years from operational

start-up,

or
    longer if approved by the Indonesian government.

Under the Contract of Work 51% of PTNNT’s shares must have
    been offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or,
    second, to Indonesian nationals by March 31, 2010. Pursuant
    to this provision, the ownership interest in the Batu Hijau
    mine’s proven and probable reserves may be reduced in the
    future to as low as 27.56% and ownership interest of NTP in
    PTNNT could be reduced to 49%, thus reducing our ability to
    control the operation at Batu Hijau. Furthermore, as part of the
    negotiation of the sale agreements with PTMDB, the parties
    executed an operating agreement under which each party
    recognizes the right of NTP to operate Batu Hijau and binds the
    parties to adhere to NTP’s standards for safety,
    environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The
    operating agreement remains in effect for so long as NTP owns
    more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the operating agreement
    terminates, then we will likely lose effective control over the
    operations of Batu Hijau and will be at risk for operations
    conducted in a manner that could potentially reduce the value of
    PTNNT or result in safety, environmental or social standards
    below those adhered to by NTP. Such loss of control may cause us
    to deconsolidate PTNNT for accounting purposes, which would
    reduce



our reported consolidated sales, cost applicable to sales,
    amortization, total assets and operating cash flow attributable
    to PTNNT. See Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Africa

Ahafo, Ghana.

Ahafo (100% owned) is located in
    the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles
    (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. We currently operate four
    open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 11 pits.
    Commercial production in the fourth pit, Amoma, began in October
    2010. The process plant consists of a conventional mill and

carbon-in-leach

circuit. Ahafo produced 545,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and at
    December 31, 2010 we reported 10.0 million ounces of
    gold reserves.

In December 2003, Ghana’s Parliament unanimously ratified
    an Investment Agreement between Newmont and the Government of
    Ghana. The Agreement establishes a fixed fiscal and legal
    regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of
    any Newmont project in Ghana. Under the Agreement, we will pay
    corporate income tax at the Ghana statutory tax rate (presently
    25% but not to exceed 32.5%) and fixed gross royalties on gold
    production of 3.0% (3.6% for any production from forest reserve
    areas). The Government of Ghana is also entitled to receive 10%
    of a project’s net cash flow after we have recouped our
    investment and may acquire up to 20% of a project’s equity
    at fair market value on or after the 15th anniversary of such
    project’s commencement of production. The Investment
    Agreement also contains commitments with respect to job training
    for local Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local
    goods and services and environmental protection. In 2009, the
    Minister of Finance implemented the National Fiscal
    Stabilization levy, which is an additional tax of profits.
    Negotiations are ongoing with the commissioner of the Ghana
    Internal Revenue Service on the applicability of the levy, given
    Newmont’s Investment Agreement. While negotiations are
    pending, we have paid and included $14 in

Income and mining
    tax expense

to date under the levy.

Akyem, Ghana.

Akyem (100% owned) is located
    approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra.
    In January 2010, we received the mining lease for Akyem. We
    continue to progress into the development stage with an emphasis
    on project engineering and obtaining all required land access
    and permits. In 2010, we selected and mobilized the project
    engineering procurement and construction contractor and we are
    advancing the project towards a construction decision in the
    first half of 2011. If all permits are secured, we expect this
    project to commence production in late 2013 or early 2014. At
    December 31, 2010, we reported 7.2 million ounces of
    gold reserves.

Proven and
    Probable Reserves

We had proven and probable gold reserves of 93.5 million
    ounces at December 31, 2010, calculated at a gold price
    assumption of $950, A$1,100 or NZ$1,350 per ounce, respectively.
    Our 2010 reserves would decline by approximately 5%
    (4.9 million ounces), if calculated at a $900 per ounce
    gold price. An increase in the gold price to $1,000 per ounce
    would increase reserves by approximately 3% (3.1 million
    ounces), all other assumptions remaining constant. For 2009,
    reserves were calculated at a gold price assumption of $800,
    A$1,000 or NZ$1,200 per ounce, respectively.

At December 31, 2010, our proven and probable gold reserves
    in North America were 33.5 million ounces. Outside of North
    America, year-end proven and probable gold reserves were
    60.0 million ounces, including 31.4 million ounces in
    Asia Pacific, 17.2 million ounces in Africa and
    11.4 million ounces in South America.

Our proven and probable copper reserves at December 31,
    2010 were 9,420 million pounds. For 2010, reserves were
    calculated at a copper price assumption of $2.50 or A$2.95 per
    pound, increased from $2.00 or A$2.40 per pound, used in 2009.

Under our current mining plans, all of our reserves are located
    on fee property or mining claims or will be depleted during the
    terms of existing mining licenses or concessions, or where
    applicable, any assured renewal or extension periods for such
    licenses or concessions.

Proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling,
    sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we
    determined economic feasibility. The price sensitivity of
    reserves depends upon several factors including grade,
    metallurgical recovery, operating cost,

waste-to-ore

ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending
    on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the
    production process used. The reserve tables below list the
    average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which
    takes into account the several different processing methods that
    we use. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralized
    material considered economic to process, varies with material
    type, metallurgical recoveries, operating costs and co- or
    by-product credits.

The proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are
    estimates based on information available at the time of
    calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels
    of recovery of gold and copper will be realized. Ounces of gold
    or pounds of copper included in the proven and probable reserves
    are calculated without regard to any losses during metallurgical
    treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on
    actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold



and copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced
    metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and
    probable reserves containing relatively lower grades of
    mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a
    reduction of reserves.

We publish reserves annually, and will recalculate reserves at
    December 31, 2011, taking into account metal prices,
    changes, if any, in future production and capital costs,
    divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and
    additions during 2011.

The following tables detail gold proven and probable reserves
    reflecting only those reserves attributable to Newmont’s
    ownership or economic interest at December 31, 2010 and
    2009:

ITEM 5.

MARKET
    FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
    AND ISSUER PURCHASE OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is listed and principally traded on the New
    York Stock Exchange under the symbol “NEM”.

On November 9, 2009, Newmont announced its intention to
    seek removal from the official list of the Australian Stock
    Exchange (“ASX”) and to suspend trading of the CHESS
    Depositary Interests (“CDIs”). The announcement was
    due to a low level of CDIs quoted on the ASX with low levels of
    trading when compared to other exchanges where it may trade.
    Further, investors seeking to purchase shares in Newmont could
    do so on the NYSE. The CDIs were suspended from trading on the
    ASX on February 10, 2010 and removed from the official list
    of the ASX on February 17, 2010.

Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited’s exchangeable
    shares (“Exchangeable Shares”) are listed on the
    Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol “NMC”.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the
    closing high and low sales prices per share of Newmont’s
    common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange
    Composite Tape:

On February 18, 2011, there were 486,564,649 shares of
    Newmont’s common stock outstanding, which were held by
    approximately 12,995 stockholders of record. A dividend of $0.15
    per share of common stock outstanding was declared in the third
    and fourth quarters of 2010, while a dividend of $0.10 per share
    of common stock outstanding was declared in the first and second
    quarters of 2010, for a total of $0.50 during 2010. A dividend
    of $0.10 per share of common stock outstanding was declared in
    each quarter of 2009, for a total of $0.40 during 2009.

The determination of the amount of future dividends will be made
    by Newmont’s Board of Directors from time to time and will
    depend on Newmont’s future earnings, capital requirements,
    financial condition and other relevant factors.

On February 18, 2011, there were outstanding 6,703,999
    Exchangeable Shares, which were held by 39 holders of record.
    The Exchangeable Shares are exchangeable at the option of the
    holders into Newmont common stock. Holders of Exchangeable
    Shares are therefore entitled to receive dividends equivalent to
    those that Newmont declares on its common stock.

No shares or other units of any class of Newmont’s equity
    securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, were purchased by the Company,
    or any affiliated purchaser, during the period October 1,
    2010 to December 31, 2010.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share,
    per ounce and per pound amounts)

The following discussion provides information that management
    believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the
    consolidated financial condition and results of operations of
    Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively,
    “Newmont,” the “Company,” “our”
    and “we”). We use certain non-GAAP financial
    performance measures in our MD&A. For a detailed
    description of each of the non-GAAP measures used in this
    MD&A, please see the discussion under
    “Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures”
    beginning on page 72. References to “A$” refer to
    Australian currency, “C$” to Canadian currency,
    “NZ$” to New Zealand currency, “IDR” to
    Indonesian currency and “$” to United States currency.

This discussion addresses matters we consider important for an
    understanding of our consolidated financial condition and
    results of operations at and for the three years ended
    December 31, 2010, as well as our future results. It
    consists of the following subsections:

•

“Overview,”

which provides a brief summary of
    our consolidated results and financial position and the primary
    factors affecting those results, as well as a summary of our
    expectations for 2011;

•

“Accounting Developments,”

which provides a
    discussion of recent changes to our accounting policies that
    have affected our consolidated results and financial position;

•

“Critical Accounting Policies,”

which provides
    an analysis of the accounting policies we consider critical
    because of their effect on the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, income

and/or

expenses in our consolidated financial statements

and/or

because they require difficult, subjective or complex judgments
    by our management;

•

“Consolidated Financial Results,”

which
    includes a discussion of our consolidated financial results for
    the last three years;

•

“Results of Consolidated Operations,”

which
    provides an analysis of the regional operating results for the
    last three years;

•

“Liquidity and Capital Resources,”

which
    contains a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, investing
    activities and financing activities, contractual obligations and
    off-balance sheet arrangements; and

•

“Non-GAAP Financial Measures,”

which
    includes descriptions of the various non-GAAP financial
    performance measures used by management, the reasons for their
    usage and a tabular reconciliation of these measures to the
    closest equivalent generally accepted accounting principle
    (“GAAP”) measure.

This item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
    financial statements and the notes thereto included in this
    annual report.

    option were completed in late 2009 and we continue to progress
    into the development stage with an emphasis on project
    engineering and obtaining all required permits. In 2010, we
    selected and mobilized the project engineering procurement and
    construction contractor. In October 2010, the project’s
    Environmental Impact Assessment was approved by the Peruvian
    authorities. A construction decision is expected in the first
    half of 2011. If all permits are secured, production is expected
    to commence in late 2014 or early 2015. At December 31,
    2010 we reported 6.1 million attributable ounces of gold
    reserves and 1,660 million attributable pounds of copper
    reserves at Conga; and

Consolidated
    Financial Performance

Sales increased 24% in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher
    average realized gold and copper prices and higher consolidated
    copper pounds sold, partially offset by fewer consolidated gold
    ounces sold. The average realized gold price increased 25% to
    $1,222 per ounce in 2010 from $977 per ounce in 2009. The
    average realized copper price, including $120 favorable mark to
    market adjustments on provisionally priced copper sales and net
    of treatment and refining charges, increased 32% to $3.43 per
    pound in 2010 compared to $2.60 per pound in 2009. Copper pounds
    sold increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher production
    at Batu Hijau and a full year of

ramp-up



production at Boddington. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2010
    compared to 2009 due to higher concentrates held in inventory at
    December 31, 2010 and lower production in North and South
    America, partially offset by higher production in Asia Pacific,
    primarily Boddington.

Costs applicable to sales

increased
    16% in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a full year of Boddington
    production and higher waste mining and milling costs, partially
    offset by lower gold sales volumes, higher by-product credits
    and a

build-up

of
    inventories and stockpiles. In addition, the effective income
    and mining tax rate was lower in 2010 due to $440 in benefits
    resulting from income tax planning for certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

•

Capital expenditures of $1,402;

•

Income and mining taxes paid of $1,185;

•

Proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau shares to noncontrolling
    interests of $229;

•

•

Acquisition of additional 17% Batu Hijau economic interest from
    noncontrolling interests for $110;

•

Dividends paid to common shareholders of $246; and

•

Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $462.

Looking
    Forward

We will continue to focus on operational and project excellence
    in 2011 to deliver on our plans and continue the advancement of
    our project pipeline, resulting in the following expectations
    for 2011:

•

Attributable gold production of approximately 5.1 to
    5.3 million ounces, primarily due to lower production at
    Batu Hijau as it moves into Phase 6 stripping, partially offset
    by higher production at Nevada and Ahafo;

•

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated gold ounce
    sold of $560 to $590 due to lower production at Batu Hijau
    combined with higher costs for energy, labor and contracted
    services;

•

Attributable copper production of approximately 190 to
    220 million pounds at

Costs applicable to sales

per
    consolidated copper pound sold of approximately $1.25 to $1.50;

•

We expect to close the Fronteer acquisition for approximately
    C$2,300 in the second quarter;

•

Consolidated capital expenditures of approximately $2,700 to
    $3,000 in 2011, with approximately 40% to be spent on major
    project initiatives, including further development of the Akyem
    project in Ghana, the Conga project in Peru, the Hope Bay
    project in Canada and the Nevada project portfolio. The
    remaining 60% is expected to be spent on several expansion and



optimization projects, routine replacements, new project
    development and other mine life extension efforts;

•

Exploration

expense of approximately $335 to
    $345; and

•

Advanced projects, research and development

expense of
    approximately $405 to $415.

Certain key factors will affect our future financial and
    operating results. These include, but are not limited to, the
    following:

•

Our 2011 expectations, particularly with respect to production
    volumes and

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce or pound,
    may differ significantly from actual quarter and full year
    results due to variations in mine planning and sequencing, ore
    grades and hardness, metal recoveries, waste removal, commodity
    input prices and foreign currency exchange rates; and

•

Potential future investments in the Hope Bay project in Canada,
    the Akyem project in Ghana, the Conga project in Peru and the
    Long Canyon project in Nevada to be acquired from Fronteer will
    require significant funding. Our operating cash flow may become
    insufficient to meet the funding requirements of these
    investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay
    dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new
    sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic
    conditions, future gold and copper prices and our operational
    performance, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and
    copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges,
    or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business
    opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our
    ongoing business activities and pay dividends could be
    significantly constrained.

Accounting
    Developments

For a discussion of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
    and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, see Note 2
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are
    critical to our financial statements due to the degree of
    uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and
    the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being
    reported.

Amortization

Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures
    that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment
    are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method at
    rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated
    future lives of such facilities or equipment and their
    components. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life
    based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of
    these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the
    relevant mine.

Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as
    incurred, where it has been determined that the property can be
    economically developed based on the existence of proven and
    probable reserves. At our surface mines, these costs include
    costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to
    initially expose the ore body. At our underground mines, these
    costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking
    and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and
    infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using
    the

units-of-production

(“UOP”) method over the estimated life of the ore body
    based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven
    and probable reserves.

Major development costs incurred after the commencement of
    production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated
    recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable
    reserves. To the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore
    body, they are amortized over the



estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable
    reserves of the entire ore body. Costs incurred to access
    specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the
    life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated
    recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of
    that specific ore block or area.

The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore
    the annual amortization charge to operations, could be
    materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the
    future is different from current forecasts of production based
    on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to
    the extent that there were significant changes in any of the
    factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These
    changes could include: (i) an expansion of proven and
    probable reserves through exploration activities;
    (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of
    production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates
    and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences
    between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions
    used in the estimation of reserves. If reserves decreased
    significantly, amortization charged to operations would
    increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly,
    amortization charged to operations would decrease. Such changes
    in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets
    depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are
    limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the
    life of the proven and probable reserves.

The expected useful lives used in amortization calculations are
    determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as
    described above. Significant judgment is involved in the
    determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given
    that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the
    useful lives assumed for the purpose of amortization
    calculations.

Carrying Value
    of Stockpiles

Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine
    and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured
    by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the
    stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on
    assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates
    (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore
    tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated
    to stockpiles based on relative values of material stockpiled
    and processed using current mining costs incurred up to the
    point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable overhead and
    amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are added to a
    stockpile based on current mining costs and removed at each
    stockpile’s average cost per recoverable ounce of gold or
    pound of copper in the stockpile. Stockpiles are reduced as
    material is removed and processed further. At December 31,
    2010 and 2009, our stockpiles had a total carrying value of
    $1,786 and $1,387, respectively.

Costs that are incurred in or benefit from the productive
    process are accumulated as stockpiles. We record stockpiles at
    the lower of average cost or net realizable value
    (“NRV”), and carrying values are evaluated at least
    quarterly. NRV represents the estimated future sales price based
    on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs
    to complete production and bring the product to sale. The
    primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of
    stockpiles include short-term and long-term metals prices and
    costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy,
    materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and
    actual production levels. The significant assumptions in
    determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit at
    December 31, 2010 included production cost and capitalized
    expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, a long-term
    gold price of $1,100 per ounce, a long-term copper price of
    $3.00 per pound and U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate
    of $0.90 per A$1.00. If short-term and long-term metals prices
    decrease, the value of the stockpiles decrease, and it may be
    necessary to record a write-down of stockpiles to NRV. During
    2008, we recorded a write-down of stockpiles to NRV of $2.

Cost allocation to stockpiles and the NRV measurement involves
    the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining
    operation regarding current and future operating and capital
    costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices,
    proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and
    other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in
    determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can
    be given that actual results will not differ significantly from
    those estimates and assumptions.

Carrying Value
    of Ore on Leach Pads

Ore on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed
    on leach pads where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the
    surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. Costs are added to ore
    on leach pads based on current mining costs, including
    applicable amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are
    removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on
    the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the
    leach pad.

Estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated
    from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured
    tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the
    leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage
    (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50%
    and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching,
    declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is
    complete.

Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach
    pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on
    pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical
    balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits
    the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result,
    the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and
    estimates are refined based on actual results over time.
    Historically, our operating results have not been materially
    impacted by variations between the estimated and actual
    recoverable quantities of gold on its leach pads. Variations
    between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes
    in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs
    to NRV are accounted for on a prospective basis. The significant
    assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine site reporting
    unit at December 31, 2010 apart from production cost and
    capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation
    included a long-term gold price of $1,100 per ounce. If
    short-term and long-term metals prices



decrease, the value of the ore on leach pads decrease, and it
    may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to
    NRV. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our leach pads had a
    total carrying value of $588 and $518, respectively.

Carrying Value
    of Long-Lived Assets

We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related
    carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is
    considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on
    an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the
    asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is
    measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash
    flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated
    quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other
    commodity prices (considering current and historical prices,
    trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs,
    capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on

life-of-mine

plans. The significant assumptions in determining the future
    cash flows for each mine site reporting unit at
    December 31, 2010 apart from production cost and
    capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation,
    included a long-term gold price of $1,100 per ounce, a long-term
    copper price of $3.00 per pound and U.S. to Australian
    dollar exchange rate of $0.90 per A$1.00. During 2008, we
    recorded an impairment of $120 to reduce the carrying value of
    property, plant and mine development as part of

Write-down of
    property, plant and mine development

.

Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven
    and probable reserves, including mineralization other than
    proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part
    of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are
    included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting
    units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether
    the assets are impaired. The term “recoverable
    minerals” refers to the estimated amount of gold or other
    commodities that will be obtained after taking into account
    losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of
    recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral
    interests are risk adjusted based on management’s relative
    confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows,
    assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are
    identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future
    cash flows from other asset groups.

As discussed above under Amortization, various factors could
    impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production
    schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally,
    production, capital and reclamation costs could differ from the
    assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess
    impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of
    recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests
    involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable
    to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have
    been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the
    identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined
    economically. Assets classified as exploration potential have
    the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset
    can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of
    geological confidence and economic modeling.



Derivative
    Instruments

With the exception of the Call Spread Transactions (as described
    in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), all
    financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative
    are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value. Changes
    in the fair market value of derivatives are recorded in the
    statements of consolidated income, except for the effective
    portion of the change in fair market value of derivatives that
    are designated as a cash flow hedge and qualify for cash flow
    hedge accounting. Management applies judgment in estimating the
    fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to
    assumptions regarding commodity prices, market volatilities,
    foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations
    in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or
    charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair market value
    of derivatives. Certain derivative contracts are accounted for
    as cash flow hedges, whereby the effective portion of changes in
    fair market value of these instruments are deferred in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

and will be
    recognized in the statements of consolidated income when the
    underlying transaction designated as the hedged item impacts
    earnings. The derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow
    hedges are designated against future foreign currency
    expenditures or future diesel expenditures, where management
    believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. To
    the extent that management determines that such future foreign
    currency or diesel expenditures are no longer probable of
    occurring, gains and losses deferred in

Accumulated other
    comprehensive income

would be reclassified to the statements
    of consolidated income immediately.

Reclamation
    and Remediation Obligations

Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the
    related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes
    in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of
    time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or
    amount of the reclamation and remediation costs. Reclamation
    obligations are based on when the spending for an existing
    environmental disturbance will occur. We review, on at least an
    annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine site in
    accordance with guidance for accounting for asset retirement
    obligations.

Reclamation obligations for inactive mines are accrued based on
    management’s best estimate of the costs expected to be
    incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where
    applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs.
    Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings
    in the period an estimate is revised.

Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires
    management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of
    the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and
    remediation work required to comply with existing laws and
    regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could
    differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to
    environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of
    reclamation and remediation work required. Any such increases in
    future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to
    earnings for reclamation and remediation.

Income and
    Mining Taxes

We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax
    assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than
    not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred
    tax assets requires management to make significant estimates
    related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of
    future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the
    application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer
    above to Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion of
    the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from
    estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable
    income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to
    realize deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date
    could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in
    the jurisdictions in which we operate could limit our ability to
    obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax
    assets recorded at the reporting date.



Our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments
    in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple
    jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many
    factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in
    various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from
    federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize
    potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated
    tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions
    based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,
    additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light
    of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the
    complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate
    resolution may result in a payment that is materially different
    from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our
    estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate
    assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If an
    estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the
    ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. We recognize
    interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in

Costs applicable to sales

for gold increased in 2010
    compared to 2009 due to a full year of Boddington production and
    higher mining and milling costs, partially offset by lower sales
    volumes, higher by-product credits and a

build-up

of
    inventories and stockpiles. The increase in 2009 compared to
    2008 was due to higher sales volumes and higher royalty and
    workers participation costs, partially offset by higher
    by-product sales and lower diesel costs.

Costs applicable to
    sales

for copper increased in 2010 from 2009 due to higher
    production and waste mining costs at Batu Hijau and a full year
    of Boddington production. The decrease in 2009 from 2008 was due
    to lower diesel and mining costs, partially offset by higher
    labor costs and the

start-up

of
    Boddington production. For a complete discussion regarding
    variations in operations, see

Results of Consolidated
    Operations

below.

Amortization

expense increased in 2010 from 2009 due to a
    full year of Boddington production, additional equipment
    purchases and higher capitalized mine development.

Amortization

expense increased in 2009 from 2008 due to
    the

start-up

of Boddington, higher underground production at Nevada and
    Jundee, development of North Lantern in Nevada, a full
    year’s amortization of Hope Bay infrastructure and higher
    production at Batu Hijau.

Amortization

expense fluctuates
    as capital expenditures increase or decrease and as production
    levels increase or decrease due to the use of the

units-of-production

amortization method for mineral interests and mine development.
    For a



complete discussion, see

Results of Consolidated
    Operations

Amortization

expense to
    be approximately $1,025 to $1,035 in 2011.

Exploration

expense increased to $218 in 2010 from $187
    in 2009 due to additional near mine expenditures in all regions,
    with the largest increase in Nevada at Leeville/Turf and Midas.

Exploration

expense decreased in 2009 from $213 in 2008
    due to a reduced drilling program related to our focus on net
    cash flow generation and a more selective and strategic
    exploration program. We expect

Exploration

expense to be
    approximately $335 to $345 in 2011.

During 2010, we added 8.2 million ounces to proven and
    probable reserves, with 6.5 million ounces of depletion.
    Reserve additions of 8.2 million ounces were primarily due
    to conversion of mineralized material at Leeville
    (1.8 million ounces), Ahafo (1.5 million ounces), Twin
    Creeks (1.4 million ounces), Phoenix (0.8 million
    ounces), La Herradura (0.7 million ounces) and Tanami



(0.7 million ounces) with most of the remaining additions
    coming from open pit and underground sources in the United
    States, Australia and South America (1.8 million ounces).
    Gold reserves were revised down by 0.5 million ounces at
    Akyem in Ghana, primarily due to new mining assumptions and
    higher cutoff grades. The estimated impact of the change in gold
    price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of
    1.7 million ounces.

During 2009, we added 6.4 million ounces to proven and
    probable reserves, with 6.8 million ounces of depletion.
    Reserve additions of 6.4 million ounces were primarily due
    to conversion of mineralized material at Gold Quarry
    (2.9 million ounces), Boddington (1.3 million ounces),
    Tanami (0.5 million ounces) and Ahafo (0.5 million
    ounces) with most of the remaining additions coming from open
    pit and underground sources in Australia and South America
    (0.6 million ounces). Gold reserves were revised down by
    0.3 million ounces at Phoenix in Nevada, primarily due to
    metallurgy, geology and modeling impacts. The estimated impact
    of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve
    additions was an increase of 1.7 million ounces.

During 2008, we added 5.2 million ounces to proven and
    probable reserves, with 6.7 million ounces of depletion.
    Reserve additions from exploration of 4.4 million ounces
    were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at
    Boddington (1.6 million ounces, 66.67% ownership), with
    most of the remaining additions coming from several open pit and
    underground sites in Nevada (totaling 1.2 million ounces)
    and from underground sites in Australia (0.7 million
    ounces). Gold reserves were revised down by 1.1 million
    ounces, primarily due to metallurgy, geology and modeling
    impacts at Phoenix in Nevada. The impact of the change in gold
    price assumption on reserve additions was an increase of
    1.9 million ounces.

Advanced projects, research and development

expense
    includes development project management costs, feasibility
    studies and certain drilling costs.

Advanced projects,
    research and development

expense increased 60% in 2010
    compared to 2009 due to additional spending at Hope Bay and
    increased spending to accelerate internal growth opportunities
    across our portfolio. Significant projects include the Hope Bay
    gold project in Nunavut, Canada, the Subika underground and
    Akyem gold projects in Ghana and the Conga copper and gold
    project in Peru. We expect

Advanced projects, research and
    development

expense to be approximately $405 to $415 in
    2011, with a focus on the major projects above.

General and administrative

expense increased to $178 in
    2010 compared to $159 in 2009 due to higher benefit and
    compensation costs.

General and administrative

expense
    increased in 2009 compared to $144 in 2008 due to higher
    benefits, mainly pension and other post retirement costs.

General and administrative

expense as a percentage of

Sales

was 1.9% in 2010, compared to 2.1% and 2.4% in 2009
    and 2008, respectively. We expect

General and administrative

expense to be approximately $190 to $200 in 2011.



Write-down of property, plant and mine development

totaled $6, $7 and $137 for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The 2010 write-down primarily related to asset
    disposals in North America and Asia Pacific. The 2009 write-down
    primarily related to asset disposals in Asia Pacific and South
    America. The 2008 write-down primarily related to mineral
    interests and other assets in North America and Asia Pacific. In
    North America, the Fort a la Corne JV assets were impaired
    based on 2008 geologic results and potential project economics
    leading to our decision to cease funding our share of project
    development costs.

Other expense, net

was $261, $358 and $240 for 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. The decrease in 2010 over 2009 is due to
    costs related to acquiring the remaining interest in Boddington,
    higher charges related to the Western Australian power plant,
    and a workforce reduction that impacted 3% of our global
    workforce in 2009, partially offset by higher community
    development costs at

Batu Hijau

in 2010. The
    increase in 2009 over 2008 is due to costs related to acquiring
    the remaining interest in Boddington in 2009, the workforce
    reduction that impacted 3% of our global workforce and an
    increase in expenses for the Western Australian power plant,
    partially offset by the recovery of provision for doubtful
    accounts expensed in 2008.

Other income, net

was $109, $88 and $123 for 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 over 2009 is
    primarily related to an increase in Canadian Oil Sands Trust
    distributions due to higher oil prices in 2010 and sales of
    non-core assets, partially offset by foreign currency exchange
    losses. The decrease in 2009 over 2008 is primarily related to a
    decrease in Canadian Oil Sands Trust distributions due to lower
    oil prices in 2009 and higher gains on sale of investments and
    exploration properties in 2008, partially offset by the

other-than-temporary

investment impairment in 2008.

Interest expense, net

was $279, $120 and $135 for 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $21,
    $111 and $47 in each year, respectively.

Interest expense,
    net

increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the reduction
    in capitalized interest as Boddington achieved commercial
    production in November 2009 and interest related to the 2019 and
    2039 senior notes issued during September 2009, partially offset
    by lack of interest due to the prepayment in 2010 of the PTNNT
    project financing and Yanacocha senior notes and credit
    facility.

Interest expense, net

decreased in 2009 from
    2008 due to higher capitalized interest related to the higher
    construction investments at Boddington, partially offset by
    additional interest on the senior notes issued in September 2009
    and convertible senior notes issued in February 2009. We expect

Interest expense, net

to be approximately $235 to $245 in
    2011.

Income and mining tax expense

was $856, $829 and $142 in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effective tax rates were
    21%, 28% and 11% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower
    effective tax rate in 2010 and 2008 is primarily due to tax
    benefits recognized as a result of “check the box”
    elections made with respect to certain of our

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

As a result of the elections, the subsidiaries are treated as
    flow-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
    The restructurings in 2010 resulted in the recording of a
    deferred tax asset, calculated as the difference between fair
    market valuations of the subsidiaries compared to the underlying
    financial statement basis in the assets. The restructuring in
    2008 resulted in a significant loss that allowed us to recover
    income taxes paid in prior years. Without the restructuring, the
    effective tax rate for 2010 and 2008 would have been 32% and
    24%, respectively. Although the 2010 tax benefit from the
    restructuring was much larger than the amount in 2008 ($440 as
    opposed to $159), the impact to the overall effective tax rate
    was diluted due to the large pretax book income for that year.

The factors that most significantly impacted our effective tax
    rates for the three periods are percentage depletion, changes in
    estimates of reserves for income tax uncertainties and the
    impact of certain specific transactions. Many of these factors
    are sensitive to the average realized price of gold and other
    metals. For a complete discussion, see Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the
    factors influencing our effective tax rate and the sensitivity
    of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed
    above, the



effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods.
    The effective tax rate is expected to be between 28% and 32% in
    2011.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

increased in 2010 from 2009 as a result of higher earnings
    at Batu Hijau and the required March 2010 divestiture of Batu
    Hijau, partially offset by lower earnings at Yanacocha and the
    additional 17% economic interest in Batu Hijau as a result of
    advancing funds to certain noncontrolling partners in exchange
    for their share of Batu Hijau’s dividends, net of
    withholding tax (for a complete discussion see Results of
    Consolidated Operations below). The 2009 increase over 2008
    resulted from increased earnings at Batu Hijau and
    Yanacocha and divestiture of a portion of Batu Hijau in
    accordance with the provisions of the Contract of Work. See

    previously sold to third parties.

In July 2009, we sold our interest in Kori Kollo in Bolivia. As
    part of the transaction, a reclamation trust fund was

2010 compared
    to 2009

Consolidated gold ounces produced decreased slightly due to:

•

lower production from South America due to mine sequencing
    resulting in increased waste mining, lower leach placement and
    lower mill ore grade; and

•

lower production from North America due to completion of mining
    at Deep Post in 2009 and geotechnical issues at Gold Quarry;
    mostly offset by

•

higher production from Asia Pacific due to a full year of
    Boddington production and higher ore grade and throughput at
    Batu Hijau; and

•

higher production from Africa due to higher ore grade.

Consolidated copper pounds produced increased 19% due to higher
    ore grade and throughput at Batu Hijau and a full year of
    Boddington production.

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated gold ounce
    sold increased 18% due to lower production from South America, a
    full year of higher cost production at Boddington and higher
    diesel, royalty and waste mining costs, partially offset by
    higher by-product credits.

Costs applicable to sales

per
    consolidated copper pound sold increased 25% due to higher waste
    mining at Batu Hijau and a full year of higher cost production
    at Boddington, partially offset by higher production at Batu
    Hijau.

2009 compared
    to 2008

Consolidated gold ounces produced increased 6% due to:

•

higher production from Asia Pacific primarily as a result of
    higher ore grade and throughput at Batu Hijau and the

start-up

of
    Boddington; and

•

higher production from South America as a result of higher grade
    and throughput at the Yanacocha mill; partially offset by

•

lower production from North America due to lower grade and lower
    leach placement in Nevada.

Consolidated copper pounds produced increased 77% due to higher
    ore grades and throughput at Batu Hijau and the

start-up

of
    Boddington.

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated gold ounce
    sold decreased 4% due to higher production, lower diesel costs
    and higher by-product credits partially offset by higher
    royalties and workers’ participation costs.

Costs
    applicable to sales

per consolidated copper pound sold
    decreased 54% due to higher copper production, lower waste
    removal costs at Batu Hijau, lower diesel costs and a lower
    co-product allocation of costs to copper at Batu Hijau.

We expect 2011 gold production of approximately 5.1 to
    5.3 million ounces attributable to Newmont, primarily due
    to lower production at Batu Hijau as it moves into Phase 6
    stripping, partially offset by higher production at Nevada and
    Ahafo. Consolidated

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce
    for 2011 are expected to be approximately $560 to $590 due to
    lower production at Batu Hijau combined with higher costs for
    energy, labor and contracted services. We expect 2011 copper
    production attributable to Newmont of approximately 190 to
    220 million pounds at consolidated

Costs applicable to
    sales

per pound of approximately $1.25 to $1.50 due to lower
    production at Batu Hijau.

Nevada, USA.

Gold ounces produced decreased
    13% due to the completion of underground mining at Deep Post in
    2009, lower Gold Quarry ore mined as a result of a geotechnical
    issue which occurred in December 2009 and lower leach tons
    placed at Twin Creeks and Carlin, partially offset by increased
    underground mining at Leeville. Total ore tons mined were 26%
    lower primarily due to the Gold Quarry slope failure and the
    completion of mining at North Lantern in April 2010. Ore placed
    on leach pads decreased 62% to 4.5 million tons.

Costs
    applicable to sales

per ounce increased 11% due to lower
    production, partially offset by higher by-product credits.

Amortization

    due to lower leach production at Yanacocha.

Costs applicable
    to sales

per ounce are expected to increase in 2011 to
    approximately $500 to $550, primarily due to lower gold
    production and higher contracted services and supplies.

Boddington, Australia.

Boddington produced
    728,000 ounces of gold and 58 million pounds of copper at

Costs applicable to sales

of $590 per ounce ($487 on a
    by-product basis; see “Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures” on page 72) and $1.86 per pound on a
    co-product basis. As Boddington continued to

ramp-up

in
    2010, production was below original expectations due to lower
    than anticipated gold grade and mill throughput.

Costs
    applicable to sales

were higher than expected due to higher
    mining and mill maintenance costs.

Amortization

per ounce
    was higher than expected due to lower production.

2010 compared
    to 2009

Batu Hijau, Indonesia.

Copper and gold
    production increased 10% and 32%, respectively, due to higher
    grade and mill throughput as a result of mining at the bottom of
    Phase 5 and processing softer ore, partially offset by lower
    recovery. Unseasonably dry weather permitted additional mining
    in the bottom of Phase 5 during the fourth quarter. Beginning in
    2011, we expect to process primarily stockpiled ore until Phase
    6 ore becomes the primary mill feed commencing in late 2013.

Costs applicable to sales

increased 11% per pound and per
    ounce due to higher waste mining and milling



costs, including higher labor and diesel costs.

Amortization

increased 19% per pound and 15% per ounce due to higher
    equipment additions, partially offset by higher production.

Other Australia/New Zealand.

Gold production
    decreased 7% due to lower mill grade at Jundee and Waihi and
    lower mill grade and throughput at Tanami, partially offset by
    higher grade, throughput and recovery at Kalgoorlie.

Costs
    applicable to sales

per ounce increased 9% due to lower
    production and a weaker U.S. dollar. Changes in Australia
    and New Zealand exchange rates increased

Costs applicable to
    sales

per ounce by $33.

Amortization

per ounce
    decreased 14% due to lower mine development costs at Waihi and
    Jundee, partially offset by lower production.

2009 compared
    to 2008

Batu Hijau, Indonesia.

Consolidated copper
    pounds and gold ounces produced increased 73% and 108%,
    respectively, due to higher mill throughput, grade and recovery
    due to processing higher grade Phase 5 ore compared to ore
    sourced primarily from lower grade and harder ore stockpiles in
    2008.

Costs applicable to sales

decreased 55% per pound
    and 48% per ounce due to higher production.

Costs applicable
    to sales

per ounce also decreased due to a higher co-product
    allocation of costs to copper due to a higher realized copper
    price.

Amortization

decreased 43% per pound and 35% per
    ounce due to higher production.

Other Australia/New Zealand.

Gold ounces
    produced decreased 4% due to lower throughput as a result of
    unplanned mill maintenance and lower grade at Tanami and a
    temporary suspension of milling operations due to an electrical
    fire at Waihi, partially offset by higher throughput and grade
    at Jundee and higher throughput, grade and recovery at
    Kalgoorlie.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce decreased
    8% due to lower diesel prices, partially offset by lower
    production, a stronger Australian dollar and higher royalties.

Amortization

per ounce increased 14% due to lower
    production, a higher mix of underground production at Jundee and
    a shortened mine life adjustment at Tanami.

Gold production for Asia Pacific is expected to decrease in 2011
    to approximately 1.9 to 2.0 million ounces attributable to
    Newmont at higher consolidated

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce of approximately $600 to $675 in 2011, primarily
    due to lower production at Batu Hijau. We expect copper
    production for the Asia Pacific region of approximately 190 to
    220 million pounds attributable to Newmont at consolidated

Costs applicable to sales

per pound of approximately
    $1.25 to $1.50 in 2011.

Ahafo, Ghana.

Gold ounces produced increased
    due to higher grade ore mined at Apensu in 2010 and the
    commencement of production at Amoma in October 2010.

Costs
    applicable to sales

per ounce increased slightly due to
    higher labor, power, diesel and royalty costs, partially offset
    by higher production.

Ahafo, Ghana.

Gold ounces produced increased
    due to higher throughput, partially offset by lower mill
    recovery.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased
    9% due to higher labor, contracted



services, maintenance and power costs, partially offset by lower
    diesel prices.

Amortization

per ounce decreased slightly
    as higher production was offset by equipment additions.

Gold production for the Africa operations is expected to be
    approximately 550,000 to 590,000 ounces in 2011 due to mining
    higher ore grade.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce of
    approximately $485 to $535 are expected for 2011, primarily as a
    result of higher energy prices and higher labor and royalty
    costs.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rates

In addition to our domestic operations in the United States, we
    have operations in Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Indonesia,
    Ghana and other foreign locations. Our operations sell their
    production based on U.S. dollar metal prices.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to
    the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and

Costs applicable to sales

to the extent costs are paid in
    foreign currencies. Such fluctuations have not had a material
    impact on our revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout
    the world principally in U.S. dollars. Approximately 36%,
    24% and 27% of our

Costs applicable to sales

were paid in
    currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Our

Costs applicable to sales

are
    most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian
    dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. However, variations in
    the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate
    historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the
    U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or
    decreases in costs at Australian locations due to exchange rate
    changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in
    sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations. No
    assurance, however, can be given that the Australian
    dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be
    strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the
    future.

Variations in local currency exchange rates in relation to the
    U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations increased

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce $10, net of hedging,
    in 2010 compared to 2009, and decreased

Costs applicable to
    sales

per ounce $6, net of hedging, in 2009 from 2008,
    primarily due to movements in the Australian dollar.

We hedge a portion of our forecasted Australian dollar
    denominated operating expenditures. At December 31, 2010,
    we have hedged 72%, 45% and 22% of our forecasted Australian
    denominated operating costs in 2011, 2012 and 2013,
    respectively, at an average rate of 0.82, 0.84 and 0.84,
    respectively.

Foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the
    U.S. dollar have not had a material impact on our
    determination of proven and probable reserves in the past.
    However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in
    relation to the Australian dollar,

and/or

to
    other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were
    not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar
    gold price or by other factors, the amount of proven and
    probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be
    reduced as certain proven and probable reserves may no longer be
    economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on
    a variety of factors including the length of time of any such
    weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management’s
    long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. Future
    reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily
    result in reduced gold or copper sales and increased
    amortization and, depending on the level of reduction, could
    also result in impairments of property, plant and mine
    development, mineral interests

and/or

goodwill.

Net cash provided from continuing operations

was a record
    $3,180 in 2010, an increase of $266 from 2009 due to higher
    realized gold and copper prices of $1,569 and $418,
    respectively, and increased consolidated copper sales volume of
    $88; partially offset by decreased gold sales volume of $234, as
    discussed above in

Consolidated Financial Results.

The
    increase was also partially offset by higher costs applicable to
    sales of $476, primarily from a full year of Boddington
    operations, higher interest expense of $159, higher current
    income and mining tax expense of $408, and an additional $527
    investment in working capital (trade receivables, inventories,
    stockpiles and ore on leach pads). Cash flow provided from
    operations during 2009 was $2,914, an increase of $1,517 from
    2008 due to higher realized gold prices of $690 and increased
    gold and copper sales volume of $337 and $623, respectively, as
    discussed above in

Consolidated Financial Results

and a
    $400 lower investment in working capital. The increase was
    partially offset by lower distributions from the Canadian Oil
    Sands Trust of $84 and higher current income and mining tax
    expense of $370.

We are currently planning to contribute $18 to our retirement
    benefit programs in 2011. For additional discussion see

    payable on one-third of gold sales from Boddington beginning in
    the second quarter of 2010. During 2010, we paid $4 in
    contingent payments in accordance with the Boddington
    acquisition agreement. Additionally, we paid $11 for a mining
    property near the La Herradura, Mexico operation in 2009.
    During the first quarter of 2008, we paid $318 to complete the
    acquisition of the Hope Bay project. In April 2008, we purchased
    additional shares of EGR for $7, net of cash acquired, bringing
    our ownership interest to 56.67% from 46.72%. In November 2008,
    EGR repurchased 6.55% of its own shares from a noncontrolling
    shareholder bringing our ownership to 60.64%.

Purchases and sales of marketable
    securities.

During 2010, we purchased marketable
    securities of $28 and we received $3 for the sale of marketable
    securities. During 2009, we purchased marketable securities of
    Regis Resources for $5 and we received $17 for the sale of Regis
    Resources shares and other marketable securities. During 2008,
    we purchased marketable securities of Gabriel Resources Ltd. for
    $11 and other marketable securities for $6 and we received $50
    for the sale of marketable securities.

Proceeds from sale of other assets.

During
    2010, we received $13 from the sale of our 40% interest in AGR
    and $5 and $4 for the sale of exploration properties in Armenia
    and Guyana, respectively. We also received $34 from the sale of
    other assets including non-core assets held at



Tanami. During 2009 and 2008, proceeds included $14 and $32,
    respectively, for the sale of other mining projects.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash provided from (used in) financing activities of
    continuing operations

was $(915) in 2010, compared to $2,572
    and $127 in 2009 and 2008, respectively, for the reasons
    explained below.

Proceeds from debt, net.

During 2009, we
    received proceeds from debt of $4,299, including $1,756 under
    our revolving credit facility, $1,080 net proceeds from the
    issuance of senior notes due in 2039, $895 net proceeds
    from the issuance of senior notes due in 2019, $504 net
    proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes due in

    received proceeds from debt of $5,078, including $4,987 under
    our revolving credit facility, $75 at Ahafo from an
    International Finance Corporation loan and $18 from shareholder
    loans.

At December 31, 2010 $153 of the $2,000 revolving credit
    facility is currently used to secure the issuance of letters of
    credit, primarily supporting reclamation obligations (see

“Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements”

below).

Repayment of debt.

During 2010, we repaid $430
    of debt, including pre-payment of the $220 remaining under the
    PTNNT project financing facility and $96 and $52 under
    Yanacocha’s senior notes and credit facility, respectively,

    sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant (classified
    as a capital lease) and $38 on other credit facilities and
    capital leases. During 2009, we repaid $2,731 of debt, including
    $2,513 under our revolving credit facility, $86 for Batu Hijau
    project financing scheduled debt repayments, $72 for short-term
    borrowings at Batu Hijau, $24 related to the sale-leaseback of
    the refractory ore treatment plant (classified as a capital
    lease) and $36 on other credit facilities and capital leases.
    During 2008, we repaid $4,483 of debt, including $4,230 under
    our revolving credit facility and scheduled debt repayments of
    $119 on maturity of the Australia notes, $87 related to Batu
    Hijau project financing, $22 related to the sale-leaseback of
    the refractory ore treatment plant (classified as a capital
    lease) and $25 on other credit facilities and capital leases.

Scheduled minimum debt repayments are $259 in 2011, $559 in
    2012, $42 in 2013, $533 in 2014, $18 in 2015 and $3,030
    thereafter. We expect to be able to fund maturities of debt from

Net cash provided by operating activities

, short-term
    investments, existing cash balances and available credit
    facilities.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we were in compliance with
    all required debt covenants and other restrictions related to
    our debt agreements.

Proceeds from stock issuance, net.

We received
    proceeds of $60, $1,278 and $29 during 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, from the issuance of common stock. In February
    2009, we completed a public offering of 34,500,000 shares
    of common stock at $37 per share for net proceeds of $1,236.

Sale of subsidiary shares to noncontrolling
    interests.

In March 2010, November 2009 and
    December 2009, Nusa Tenggara Partnership (“NTP”)
    completed the sale of 7%, 10% and 7% of shares in PTNNT to a
    third party buyer, respectively. These transactions reduced our
    direct ownership interest in PTNNT to 31.5%. Cash proceeds from
    the 2010 and 2009 sales were $229 and $638, respectively, with
    our 56.25% share being $129 and $359, respectively, and the
    remaining balances paid to our NTP partner.

Acquisition of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling
    interests.

On June 25, 2010,
    P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an unrelated
    noncontrolling partner of PTNNT, completed the sale of
    approximately a 2.2% interest in PTNNT to PT Indonesia Masbaga
    Investama (“PTIMI”). To enable the transaction to
    proceed, we released our rights to the dividends payable on this
    2.2% interest and released our security interest in the
    associated shares. We further agreed to advance certain funds to
    PTIMI to enable it to purchase the interest in exchange for an
    assignment by PTIMI to us of the dividends



payable on the 2.2% interest (net of withholding tax), a pledge
    of the shares as security for the loan and certain voting rights
    and obligations. The funds that we advanced to PTIMI and which
    it paid to PTPI for the shares were used by PTPI to reduce its
    outstanding loan balance with us. Upon completion of this
    transaction, PTPI requested and was allowed to make additional
    draw-downs under our agreement with PTPI. Our economic interest
    in PTPI’s and PTIMI’s combined 20% interest in PTNNT
    remains at 17% and has not changed as a result of these
    transactions.

On December 22, 2009, we entered into a transaction with
    PTPI whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTPI in
    exchange for a pledge of the noncontrolling partner’s 20%
    share of PTNNT dividends, net of withholding tax, certain voting
    rights and obligations and a commitment from PTPI to support the
    application of our standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau
    mine. As a result, our effective economic interest in PTNNT
    increased by 17%. In connection with the above transaction, we
    advanced additional funds to PTPI during 2010.

Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests.

We
    paid dividends of $462, $394 and $389 to noncontrolling
    interests during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    dividends paid in 2010 and 2009 included $100 and $279,
    respectively, for our NTP partner’s share of the interest
    sold in Batu Hijau during those years.

Dividends paid to common stockholders.

We paid
    annual dividends of $0.50 per common share during 2010 and
    $0.40 per common share during 2009 and 2008. Additionally,
    Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited, a subsidiary of
    the Company, paid annual dividends of C$0.52, C$0.46 and C$0.43
    during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. On February 23,
    2011, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.15 per
    share, payable March 30, 2011 to holders of record at the
    close of business on March 15, 2011. Total dividends paid
    to common stockholders were $246, $196 and $182 in 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively.

was $11 in 2008 and included accrued expense
    payments on the royalty portfolio sale of $11 and additions to
    property, plant and mine development of $5 at Kori Kollo
    partially offset by proceeds of $5 from the sale of other former
    mining assets.

Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued
    operations

was $2 and $4 in 2009 and 2008, respectively, for
    repayment of debt at Kori Kollo.

Corporate
    Revolving Credit Facility

The Company has an uncollateralized $2,000 revolving credit
    facility with a syndicate of commercial banks, which matures in
    April 2012. The facility contains a letter of credit

sub-facility.

Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the credit
    ratings of the Company’s senior, uncollateralized,
    long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest at
    an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.28% or the
    lead bank’s prime interest rate. Facility fees accrue at an
    annual rate of 0.07% of the aggregate commitments. The Company
    also pays a utilization fee of 0.05% on the amount of revolving



credit loans and letters of credit outstanding under the
    facility for each day on which the sum of such loans and letters
    of credit exceed 50% of the commitments under the facility. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the facility fees were 0.07% of
    the commitment. There was $153 and $452 outstanding under the
    letter of credit

sub-facility

at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At
    December 31, 2010, $nil was borrowed under the facility.

Debt
    Covenants

The Company’s senior notes, and sale-leaseback of the
    refractory ore treatment plant debt facilities contain various
    covenants and default provisions including payment defaults,
    limitation on liens, limitation on sales and leaseback
    agreements and merger restrictions.

The Ahafo project facility contains a financial ratio covenant
    requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of
    cash and cash equivalents) to EBITDA (earnings before interest
    expense, income and mining taxes, depreciation and amortization)
    ratio of less than or equal to 4.0 and a net debt to total
    capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5%.

In addition to the covenants noted above, the corporate
    revolving credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant
    requiring us to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and
    cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less than or
    equal to 62.5%. Furthermore, the corporate revolving credit
    facility contains covenants limiting the sale of all or
    substantially all of our assets, certain change of control
    provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we were in compliance with
    all debt covenants and provisions related to potential defaults.

Shelf
    Registration Statement

In September 2009, we filed with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (the “SEC”) a shelf registration statement
    on

Form S-3

which enables the Company to issue an indeterminate number or
    amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities,
    guarantees of debt securities and warrants from time to time at
    indeterminate prices. It also included the resale of an
    indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock and debt
    securities from time to time upon exercise of warrants or
    conversion of convertible securities.

Future Cash
    Flows

We anticipate significant future capital expenditures (see
    Investing Activities, above), funding of exploration and
    advanced projects, debt repayments and dividends to both common
    shareholders and noncontrolling interests will impact

Net
    cash used in investing activities

and

Net cash used in
    financing activities

and exceed

Net cash provided by
    operations

. Our ability to raise and service significant new
    sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic
    conditions, future gold and copper prices as well as our
    operational performance, current cash flow and debt position,
    among other factors. Although we currently carry a large cash
    balance, we may determine that it may be necessary or
    appropriate to issue additional equity or other securities,
    defer projects or sell assets. Additional financing may not be
    available when needed or, if available, the terms of such
    financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering
    equity securities, may involve substantial dilution to existing



stockholders. In the event of lower gold and copper prices,
    unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding
    limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities,
    invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business
    activities, retire or service all outstanding debt and pay
    dividends could be significantly constrained. For information on
    our long-term debt, capital lease obligations and operating
    leases, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

On February 3, 2011, we announced an agreement with
    Fronteer Gold, Inc. (“Fronteer”) to acquire all of the
    outstanding common shares of Fronteer. Fronteer shareholders
    will receive C$14.00 in cash and one common share of Pilot Gold
    Inc., a Canadian Corporation, which will retain certain
    exploration assets of Fronteer, for each common share of
    Fronteer. The transaction is expected to close in the second
    quarter of 2011 for approximately C$2,300.

Cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the
    realized prices of gold and copper. For information on the
    sensitivity of our

Net cash provided by operations

to
    metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures about Market Risk.

Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in
    foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the
    U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Australian
    dollar. Accordingly, we have entered into derivative instruments
    to reduce the volatility of

Costs applicable to sales

in
    Asia Pacific. For information concerning the sensitivity of our

Costs applicable to sales

to changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates, see Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rates, above. For information on the
    sensitivity of our

Net cash provided from operations

to
    foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7A, Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Net cash
    provided from operations

will also be impacted in 2011 as a
    result of planned contributions of $18 for our post-retirement
    benefit programs.

Based on expected attributable production of between 5.1 and
    5.3 million ounces of gold and between 190 and
    220 million pounds of copper in 2011, we do not anticipate
    reasonably expected variations in our production profile alone
    to influence our ability to pay our debt and other obligations
    in 2011.

Environmental

Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various
    federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection
    of the environment. We have made, and expect to make in the
    future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations,
    but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.
    At December 31, 2010 and 2009, $904 and $698, respectively,
    were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently or
    recently producing mineral properties, of which $46 is
    classified as a current liability. For more information on the
    Company’s reclamation and remediation liabilities, see
    Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning
    environmental obligations associated with former mining
    activities. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for
    these matters, $144 and $161 were accrued for such obligations
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We spent $23,
    $20 and $39 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for
    environmental obligations related to former, primarily historic,
    mining activities, and have classified $18 as a current
    liability. Expenditures for 2010 related primarily to the Con
    mine in Canada which was acquired as part of the Miramar
    acquisition, the Mt. Leyshon property in Australia, which is a
    legacy Normandy site, the Dawn mill site and Resurrection, a
    mine site in Leadville, Colorado. Expenditures for 2009 related
    primarily to Grass Valley in California, the Mt. Leyshon
    property, the Dawn mill site in Washington State and the Con
    mine. Expenditures for 2008 related primarily to Resurrection as
    well as the Mt. Leyshon property. For more information on the
    Company’s obligations associated with former mining
    activities, see Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.



Included in capital expenditures were $118, $131 and $231 in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, to comply with environmental
    regulations. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental
    regulations have not been a significant component of

Costs

Forward-Looking
    Statements

The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain
    information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor
    created thereby. See the discussion in Forward-Looking
    Statements in Item 1, Business.

Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures

Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional
    information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed
    by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
    These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a
    substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance
    with GAAP.

Adjusted net
    income

Management of the Company uses Adjusted net income to evaluate
    the Company’s operating performance, and for planning and
    forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the
    use of Adjusted net income allows investors and analysts to
    compare results of the continuing operations of the Company and
    its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production
    and sale of minerals to similar operating results of other
    mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items,
    income or loss from discontinued operations and the permanent
    impairment of assets, including marketable securities and
    goodwill. Management’s determination of the components of
    Adjusted net income are evaluated periodically and based, in
    part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining
    industry analysts.

Revenue and

Costs applicable to sales

for Boddington are
    presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements for both gold
    and copper due to the significant portion of copper production
    (approximately

15-20%

of
    total revenue based on the latest

life-of-mine

plan and metal price assumptions). The co-product method
    allocates costs applicable to sales to each metal based on
    specifically identifiable costs where applicable and on a
    relative proportion of revenue values for other



costs. Management also assesses the performance of the
    Boddington mine on a by-product basis due to the majority of
    revenues being derived from gold and to determine contingent
    consideration payments that may be paid to AngloGold for the
    acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in Boddington. The
    by-product method deducts copper revenue from costs applicable
    to sales as shown in the following table:

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (dollars in
    millions except per share, per ounce and per pound
    amounts)

Metal
    Price

Changes in the market price of gold and copper significantly
    affect our profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can
    fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand;
    forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and
    lending; investor sentiment; the relative strength of the
    U.S. dollar and global mine production levels. Copper is
    traded on established international exchanges and copper prices
    generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be
    influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by
    currency exchange rates.

Foreign
    Currency

Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to
    the U.S. dollar may affect our profitability and cash flow.
    Foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to
    numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and
    U.S. currencies and U.S. and foreign country economic
    conditions. In addition to our operations in the United States,
    we have assets or operations in Australia, Peru, Indonesia,
    Canada, New Zealand, Ghana and Mexico. Our

non-U.S. operations

sell their metal production based on a U.S. dollar gold
    price. Fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in
    relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit
    margins and

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce to the
    extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations.
    The Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate has had the
    greatest impact on our

Costs applicable to sales

, as
    measured in U.S. dollars. However, variations in the
    Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate have
    historically been strongly correlated to variations in the
    U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or
    decreases in costs at Australian gold operations due to exchange
    rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in
    sales reported in U.S. dollars for such locations. No
    assurance can be given that the Australian
    dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be
    strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the
    future, or that short-term changes in the Australian
    dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will not have an impact on
    our profitability and cash flow. Foreign currency exchange rates
    in relation to the U.S. dollar have not had a material
    impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves in
    the past. However, if a sustained weakening of the
    U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar,

and/or

to
    other foreign currencies that impact our cost



structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the
    U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, profitability,
    cash flows and the amount of proven and probable reserves in the
    applicable foreign country could be reduced. The extent of any
    such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors
    including the length of time of any such weakening of the
    U.S. dollar, and management’s long-term view of the
    applicable exchange rate. For information concerning the
    sensitivity of our

Costs applicable to sales

to changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7,
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated
    Results of Operations and Financial Condition-Results of
    Consolidated Operations-Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above.

Hedging

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes
    in gold and copper prices by selling our production at spot
    market prices. Consequently, we do not hedge our gold and copper
    sales. We have and will continue to manage certain risks
    associated with commodity input costs, interest rates and
    foreign currencies using the derivative market.

By using derivatives, we are affected by credit risk, market
    risk and market liquidity risk. Credit risk is the risk that a
    third party might fail to fulfill its performance obligations
    under the terms of a financial instrument. We mitigate credit
    risk by entering into derivatives with high credit quality
    counterparties, limiting the amount of exposure to each
    counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of the
    counterparties. Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a
    derivative might be adversely affected by a change in underlying
    commodity prices, interest rates, or currency exchange rates,
    and that this in turn affects our financial condition. We manage
    market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit
    the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. We
    mitigate this potential risk to our financial condition by
    establishing trading agreements with counterparties under which
    we are not required to post any collateral or make any margin
    calls on our derivatives. Our counterparties cannot require
    settlement solely because of an adverse change in the fair value
    of a derivative. Market liquidity risk is the risk that a
    derivative cannot be eliminated quickly, by either liquidating
    it or by establishing an offsetting position. Under the terms of
    our trading agreements, counterparties cannot require us to
    immediately settle outstanding derivatives, except upon the
    occurrence of customary events of default such as covenant
    breeches, including financial covenants, insolvency or
    bankruptcy. We further mitigate market liquidity risk by
    spreading out the maturity of our derivatives over time.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

We utilize foreign currency contracts to reduce the variability
    of the US dollar amount of forecasted foreign currency
    expenditures caused by changes in exchange rates. We hedge a
    portion of our A$ and NZ$ denominated operating expenditures
    which results in a blended rate realized each period. The
    hedging instruments are fixed forward contracts with expiration
    dates ranging up to five years from the date of issue. The
    principal hedging objective is reduction in the volatility of
    realized

period-on-period

$/A$ and $/NZ$ rates, respectively. We use diesel contracts to
    reduce the variability of our operating cost exposure related to
    diesel prices of fuel consumed at our Nevada operations. All of
    the currency and diesel contracts have been designated as cash
    flow hedges of future expenditures, and as such, changes in the
    market value have been recorded in

Accumulated other
    comprehensive income

. Gains and losses from hedge
    ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings.

Treasury Rate
    Lock Contracts

In connection with the 2019 and 2039 notes issued in September
    2009, we acquired treasury rate lock contracts to reduce the
    variability of the proceeds realized from the bond issuances.
    The treasury rate locks resulted in $6 and $5 unrealized gains
    for the 2019 and 2039 notes, respectively. We previously
    acquired treasury rate locks in connection with the issuance of
    the 2035 notes that resulted in a $10 unrealized loss. The
    gains/losses from these contracts are recognized in

Interest

Interest Rate
    Risk

At December 31, 2010, we had $222 fixed to floating swap
    contracts designated as a hedge against our


/


% debentures
    due 2011. The interest rate swap contracts assist in managing
    our mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Under the hedge
    contract terms, we receive fixed-rate interest payments at 8.63%
    and pay floating-rate interest amounts based on periodic London
    Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) settings plus a
    spread, ranging from 2.60% to 7.63%. The interest rate swap
    contracts were designated as fair value hedges and changes in
    fair value have been recorded in income in each period,
    consistent with recording changes to the

mark-to-market

value of the underlying hedged liability in income. The fair
    value of the interest rate swaps was $3 and $7 at
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.



Provisional
    Copper and Gold Sales

Our provisional copper and gold sales contain an embedded
    derivative that is required to be separated from the host
    contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the
    receivable from the sale of the gold and copper concentrates at
    the prevailing indices’ prices at the time of sale. The
    embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge
    accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period
    prior to final settlement.

The average LME copper price was $3.43 per pound during 2010,
    compared with our recorded average provisional price of $3.42
    before

mark-to-market

gains and treatment and refining charges. During 2010,
    increasing copper prices resulted in a provisional pricing

mark-to-market

gain of $120 ($0.22 per pound). At December 31, 2010, we
    had copper sales of 111 million pounds priced at an average
    of $4.40 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next
    several months. Each $0.10 change in the price for provisionally
    priced sales would have an approximate $4 effect on our

Net
    income attributable to Newmont stockholders

.

The average London P.M. fix for gold was $1,225 per ounce during
    2010, compared with our recorded average provisional price of
    $1,224 per ounce before

mark-to-market

gains and treatment and refining charges. During 2010,
    increasing gold prices resulted in a provisional pricing

mark-to-market

gain of $41 ($7 per ounce). At December 31, 2010, we had
    gold sales of 105,000 ounces priced at an average of $1,411 per
    ounce, subject to final pricing over the next several months.
    Each $10 change in the price for provisionally priced gold sales
    would have an approximate $1 effect on our

Net income
    attributable to Newmont stockholders

.

Fixed and
    Variable Rate Debt

We have both fixed and variable rate debt. 99% and 93% of our
    debt portfolio was fixed rate debt at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively. The carrying value of fixed rate debt
    increased primarily due to note discount amortization. Variable
    rate debt as a percentage of total debt decreased primarily due
    to the full repayment of the PTNNT project financing facility of
    $219, Yanacocha credit facility of $62, and Yanacocha senior
    notes of $100. We may manage our fixed and variable rate debt
    blend by entering into interest rate swap agreements (see
    Interest Rate Risk above). Our fixed rate debt exposure at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 is summarized as follows:

At December 31,

    facilities were also excluded in 2009, prior to their full
    repayment in 2010. The estimated fair value quoted above may or

    variations may differ from the above assumptions.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    Company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors,
    management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting at
    December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, the
    Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

. Based
    upon its assessment, management concluded that, at
    December 31, 2010, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company’s assessment of internal
    control over financial reporting at December 31, 2010 has
    been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
    which appears herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Newmont Mining
    Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
    income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows present fairly,
    in all material respects, the financial position of Newmont
    Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting at
    December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8.
    Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements and on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted
    our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in
    millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound
    amounts)

NOTE 1

THE
    COMPANY

Newmont Mining Corporation and its affiliates and subsidiaries
    (collectively, “Newmont” or the “Company”)
    predominantly operates in the mining industry, focused on the
    exploration for and production of gold and copper. The Company
    has significant assets in the United States, Australia, Peru,
    Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, New Zealand and Mexico. The cash flow
    and profitability of the Company’s operations are
    significantly affected by the market price of gold, and to a
    lesser extent, copper. The prices of gold and copper are
    affected by numerous factors beyond the Company’s control.

References to “A$” refers to Australian currency,
    “C$” to Canadian currency, “NZ$” to New
    Zealand currency, “IDR” to Indonesian currency and
    “$” to United States currency.

NOTE 2

SUMMARY OF
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of
    Estimates

The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been
    prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
    accounting principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of the
    Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires the
    Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The more
    significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and
    assumptions relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for
    future cash flow estimates utilized in impairment calculations
    and

units-of-production

amortization calculations; environmental, reclamation and
    closure obligations; estimates of recoverable gold and other
    minerals in stockpile and leach pad inventories; estimates of
    fair value for certain reporting units and asset impairments
    (including impairments of goodwill, long-lived assets and
    investments); write-downs of inventory, stockpiles and ore on
    leach pads to net realizable value; post-employment,
    post-retirement and other employee benefit liabilities;
    valuation allowances for deferred tax assets; reserves for
    contingencies and litigation; and the fair value and accounting
    treatment of financial instruments including marketable
    securities and derivative instruments. The Company bases its
    estimates on historical experience and on various other
    assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
    circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may differ
    significantly from these estimates under different assumptions
    or conditions.

Principles of
    Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
    Newmont Mining Corporation and more-than-50%-owned subsidiaries
    that it controls and entities over which control is achieved
    through means other than voting rights. The Company also
    includes its pro-rata share of assets, liabilities and
    operations for unincorporated joint ventures in which it has an
    interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
    have been eliminated. The functional currency for the majority
    of the Company’s operations, including the Australian
    operations, is the U.S. dollar.

The Company follows

FASB Accounting Standards Codification

(“ASC”) guidance for identification and reporting
    of entities over which control is achieved through means other
    than voting rights. The guidance defines such entities as
    Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”). Newmont
    identified the Nusa Tenggara Partnership (“NTP”), a
    partnership between Newmont and an affiliate of Sumitomo, that
    owns a 56% interest in PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara
    (“PTNNT” or “Batu Hijau”), as a VIE due to
    certain capital structures and contractual relationships.
    Newmont also identified PT Pukuafu Indah

(“PTPI”) and PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama
    (“PTIMI”), unrelated noncontrolling partners of PTNNT,
    as VIEs. Newmont entered into transactions with PTPI and PTIMI,
    whereby the Company agreed to advance certain funds in exchange
    for a pledge of the noncontrolling partners’ combined 20%
    share of PTNNT dividends, net of withholding tax. The agreements
    also provide Newmont with certain voting rights and obligations
    related to the noncontrolling partners’ combined 20% share
    of PTNNT and commitments from PTPI and PTIMI to support the
    application of Newmont’s standards to the operation of the
    Batu Hijau mine. The Company has determined itself to be the
    primary beneficiary of these entities and controls the
    operations of Batu Hijau, and therefore consolidates PTNNT in
    the Company’s financial statements.

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and
    highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
    months or less. Because of the short maturity of these
    investments, the carrying amounts approximate their fair value.
    Cash and cash equivalents are invested in United States Treasury
    securities and money market securities. Restricted cash is
    excluded from cash and cash equivalents and is included in other
    current and long-term assets.

Investments

Management determines the appropriate classification of its
    investments in equity securities at the time of purchase and
    reevaluates such determinations at each reporting date.
    Investments in incorporated entities in which the Company’s
    ownership is greater than 20% and less than 50%, or which the
    Company does not control through majority ownership or means
    other than voting rights, are accounted for by the equity method
    and are included in long-term assets. The Company accounts for
    its equity security investments as available for sale securities
    in accordance with ASC guidance on accounting for certain
    investments in debt and equity securities. The Company
    periodically evaluates whether declines in fair values of its
    investments below the Company’s carrying value are

other-than-temporary

in accordance with guidance for the meaning of

other-than-temporary

impairment and its application to certain investments. The
    Company’s policy is to generally treat a decline in the
    investment’s quoted market value that has lasted
    continuously for more than six months as an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. The Company also monitors its investments for
    events or changes in circumstances that have occurred that may
    have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the
    investment and evaluates qualitative and quantitative factors
    regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss and
    the Company’s ability to hold the investment until a
    forecasted recovery occurs to determine if the decline in value
    of an investment is

other-than-temporary.

Declines in fair value below the Company’s carrying value
    deemed to be

other-than-temporary

are charged to earnings. Additional information concerning the
    Company’s equity method and security investments is
    included in Note 18.

Stockpiles,
    Ore on Leach Pads and Inventories

As described below, costs that are incurred in or benefit the
    productive process are accumulated as stockpiles, ore on leach
    pads and inventories. Stockpiles, ore on leach pads and
    inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or net
    realizable value. Net realizable value represents the estimated
    future sales price of the product based on current and long-term
    metals prices, less the estimated costs to complete production
    and bring the product to sale. Write-downs of stockpiles, ore on
    leach pads and inventories, resulting from net realizable value
    impairments, are reported as a component of

Costs applicable
    to sales

. The current portion of stockpiles, ore on leach
    pads and inventories is determined based on the expected amounts
    to be processed within the next 12 months.



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Stockpiles, ore on leach pads and inventories not expected to be
    processed within the next 12 months are classified as
    long-term. The major classifications are as follows:

Stockpiles

Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine
    and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured
    by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the
    stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on
    assay data) and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates
    (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore
    tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated
    to stockpiles based on relative values of material stockpiled
    and processed using current mining costs incurred up to the
    point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable overhead and
    amortization relating to mining operations, and removed at each
    stockpile’s average cost per recoverable unit.

Ore on Leach
    Pads

The recovery of gold from certain gold oxide ores is achieved
    through the heap leaching process. Under this method, oxide ore
    is placed on leach pads where it is treated with a chemical
    solution, which dissolves the gold contained in the ore. The
    resulting gold-bearing solution is further processed in a plant
    where the gold is recovered. Costs are added to ore on leach
    pads based on current mining costs, including applicable
    amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed
    from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the
    average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the
    leach pad.

The estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are
    calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads
    (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed
    on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery
    percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover
    between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year
    of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching
    process is complete.

Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach
    pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on
    pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical
    balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits
    the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result,
    the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and
    estimates are refined based on actual results over time.
    Historically, the Company’s operating results have not been
    materially impacted by variations between the estimated and
    actual recoverable quantities of gold on its leach pads.
    Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting
    from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in
    write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a
    prospective basis.

In-process
    Inventory

In-process inventories represent materials that are currently in
    the process of being converted to a saleable product. Conversion
    processes vary depending on the nature of the ore and the
    specific processing facility, but include mill in-circuit, leach
    in-circuit, flotation and column cells, and carbon in-pulp
    inventories. In-process material is measured based on assays of
    the material fed into the process and the projected recoveries
    of the respective plants. In-process inventories are valued at
    the average cost of the material fed into the process
    attributable to the source material coming from the mines,
    stockpiles

and/or

leach
    pads plus the in-process conversion costs, including applicable
    amortization relating to the process facilities incurred to that
    point in the process.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Precious Metals
    Inventory

Precious metals inventories include gold doré

and/or

gold
    bullion. Precious metals that result from the Company’s
    mining and processing activities are valued at the average cost
    of the respective in-process inventories incurred prior to the
    refining process, plus applicable refining costs.

Concentrate
    Inventory

Concentrate inventories represent copper and gold concentrate
    available for shipment. The Company values concentrate inventory
    at the average cost, including an allocable portion of support
    costs and amortization. Costs are added and removed to the
    concentrate inventory based on tons of concentrate and are
    valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.

Materials and
    Supplies

Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost
    or net realizable value. Cost includes applicable taxes and
    freight.

Property,
    Plant and Mine Development

Facilities and
    equipment

Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures
    that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment
    are capitalized and recorded at cost. The facilities and
    equipment are amortized using the straight-line method at rates
    sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated productive
    lives, which do not exceed the related estimated mine lives, of
    such facilities based on proven and probable reserves.

Mine
    Development

Mine development costs include engineering and metallurgical
    studies, drilling and other related costs to delineate an ore
    body, the removal of overburden to initially expose an ore body
    at open pit surface mines and the building of access ways,
    shafts, lateral access, drifts, ramps and other infrastructure
    at underground mines. Costs incurred before mineralization are
    classified as proven and probable reserves are expensed and
    classified as

Exploration

or

Advanced projects,
    research and development

expense. Capitalization of mine
    development project costs, that meet the definition of an asset,
    begins once mineralization is classified as proven and probable
    reserves.

Drilling and related costs are capitalized for an ore body where
    proven and probable reserves exist and the activities are
    directed at obtaining additional information on the ore body or
    converting non-reserve mineralization to proven and probable
    reserves and the benefit is expected to be realized over a
    period beyond one year. All other drilling and related costs are
    expensed as incurred. Drilling costs incurred during the
    production phase for operational ore control are allocated to
    inventory costs and then included as a component of

Costs
    applicable to sales

.

The cost of removing overburden and waste materials to access
    the ore body at an open pit mine prior to the production phase
    are referred to as “pre-stripping costs.”
    Pre-stripping costs are capitalized during the development of an
    open pit mine. Where multiple open pits exist at a mining
    complex utilizing common processing facilities, pre-stripping
    costs are capitalized at each pit. The removal, production, and
    sale of de minimis saleable materials may occur during
    development and are recorded as

Other income

, net of
    incremental mining and processing costs.

The production phase of an open pit mine commences when saleable
    minerals, beyond a de minimis amount, are produced. Stripping
    costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

variable production costs that are included as a component of
    inventory to be recognized in

Costs applicable to sales

in the same period as the revenue from the sale of
    inventory. The Company’s definition of a mine and the
    mine’s production phase may differ from that of other
    companies in the mining industry resulting in incomparable
    allocations of stripping costs to deferred mine development and
    production costs. Other mining companies may expense
    pre-stripping costs associated with subsequent pits within a
    mining complex.

Mine development costs are amortized using the

units-of-production

(“UOP”) method based on estimated recoverable ounces
    or pounds in proven and probable reserves. To the extent that
    these costs benefit an entire ore body, they are amortized over
    the estimated life of the ore body. Costs incurred to access
    specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the
    life of that area are amortized over the estimated life of that
    specific ore block or area.

Mineral
    Interests

Mineral interests include acquired interests in production,
    development and exploration stage properties. The mineral
    interests are capitalized at their fair value at the acquisition
    date, either as an individual asset purchase or as part of a
    business combination.

The value of such assets is primarily driven by the nature and
    amount of mineralized material believed to be contained in such
    properties. Production stage mineral interests represent
    interests in operating properties that contain proven and
    probable reserves. Development stage mineral interests represent
    interests in properties under development that contain proven
    and probable reserves. Exploration stage mineral interests
    represent interests in properties that are believed to
    potentially contain mineralized material consisting of
    (i) mineralized material such as inferred material within
    pits; measured, indicated and inferred material with
    insufficient drill spacing to qualify as proven and probable
    reserves; and inferred material in close proximity to proven and
    probable reserves; (ii) around-mine exploration potential
    such as inferred material not immediately adjacent to existing
    reserves and mineralization, but located within the immediate
    mine area; (iii) other mine-related exploration potential
    that is not part of measured, indicated or inferred material and
    is comprised mainly of material outside of the immediate mine
    area; (iv) greenfields exploration potential that is not
    associated with any other production, development or exploration
    stage property, as described above; or (v) any acquired
    right to explore or extract a potential mineral deposit. The
    Company’s mineral rights generally are enforceable
    regardless of whether proven and probable reserves have been
    established. In certain limited situations, the nature of a
    mineral right changes from an exploration right to a mining
    right upon the establishment of proven and probable reserves.
    The Company has the ability and intent to renew mineral
    interests where the existing term is not sufficient to recover
    all identified and valued proven and probable reserves

and/or

undeveloped mineralized material.

Asset
    Impairment

The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for
    impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An
    impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future
    cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying
    amount of the assets, including goodwill, if any. An impairment
    loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated
    future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on
    quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other
    commodity prices (considering current and historical prices,
    trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs,
    capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on

life-of-mine

plans. Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond
    proven and probable reserves, including mineralization that is
    not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base,
    are included when determining the fair value of mine



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in
    determining whether the assets are impaired. The term
    “recoverable minerals” refers to the estimated amount
    of gold or other commodities that will be obtained after taking
    into account losses during ore processing and treatment.
    Estimates of recoverable minerals from such exploration stage
    mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management’s
    relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash
    flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there
    are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of
    future cash flows from other asset groups. The Company’s
    estimates of future cash flows are based on numerous assumptions
    and it is possible that actual future cash flows will be
    significantly different than the estimates, as actual future
    quantities of recoverable minerals, gold and other commodity
    prices, production levels and costs and capital are each subject
    to significant risks and uncertainties.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized, net of treatment and refining charges,
    from a sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    the price is determinable, the product has been delivered, the
    title has been transferred to the customer and collection of the
    sales price is reasonably assured. Revenues from by-product
    sales are credited to

Costs applicable to sales

as a
    by-product credit.

Concentrate sales are initially recorded based on 100% of the
    provisional sales prices. Until final settlement occurs,
    adjustments to the provisional sales prices are made to take
    into account the

mark-to-market

changes based on the forward prices for the estimated month of
    settlement. For changes in metal quantities upon receipt of new
    information and assay, the provisional sales quantities are
    adjusted as well. The principal risks associated with
    recognition of sales on a provisional basis include metal price
    fluctuations between the date initially recorded and the date of
    final settlement. If a significant decline in metal prices
    occurs between the provisional pricing date and the final
    settlement date, it is reasonably possible that the Company
    could be required to return a portion of the sales proceeds
    received based on the provisional invoice.

The Company’s sales based on a provisional price contain an
    embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the
    host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the
    receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward
    exchange price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative,
    which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market
    through earnings each period prior to final settlement.

Income and
    Mining Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability
    method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the
    financial reporting basis of the Company’s liabilities and
    assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and
    assets. This method generates either a net deferred income tax
    liability or asset for the Company, as measured by the statutory
    tax rates in effect. The Company derives its deferred income tax
    charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net
    deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year.
    Mining taxes represent state and provincial taxes levied on
    mining operations and are classified as income taxes; as such
    taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. With respect
    to the earnings that the Company derives from the operations of
    its consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the
    earnings are indefinitely reinvested, no deferred taxes have
    been provided on the unremitted earnings (including the excess
    of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for
    financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of such equity)
    of these consolidated companies.

The Company’s deferred income tax assets include certain
    future tax benefits. The Company records a valuation allowance
    against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when it



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

believes, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more
    likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income
    tax asset will not be realized.

The Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties
    and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in
    multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon
    many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in
    various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from
    federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company
    recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for
    anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax
    jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent
    to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company adjusts
    these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances;
    however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties,
    the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is
    materially different from the Company’s current estimate of
    the tax liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax
    liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an
    additional charge to expense would result. If the estimate of
    tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate
    assessment, a tax benefit would result. The Company recognizes
    interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in

Income and mining tax expense

.

Reclamation
    and Remediation Costs

Reclamation obligations are recognized when incurred and
    recorded as liabilities at fair value. The liability is accreted
    over time through periodic charges to earnings. In addition, the
    asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the asset’s
    carrying value and amortized over the life of the related asset.
    Reclamation costs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes
    in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of
    time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or
    amount of the reclamation and abandonment costs. The reclamation
    obligation is based on when spending for an existing
    environmental disturbance will occur. The Company reviews, on an
    annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary, the reclamation
    obligation at each mine site in accordance with ASC guidance for
    accounting reclamation obligations.

Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on
    management’s best estimate at the end of each period of the
    costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates
    include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and
    monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are
    reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised.

Foreign
    Currency

The functional currency for the majority of the Company’s
    operations, including the Australian operations, is the
    U.S. dollar. All monetary assets and liabilities where the
    functional currency is the U.S. dollar are translated at
    current exchange rates and the resulting adjustments are
    included in

Other income, net

. All monetary assets and
    liabilities recorded in functional currencies other than
    U.S. dollars are translated at current exchange rates and
    the resulting adjustments are charged or credited directly to

Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies are translated at
    the weighted-average exchange rates for the period.

Derivative
    Instruments

Newmont has fixed forward contracts designated as cash flow
    hedges in place to hedge against changes in foreign exchanges
    rates and diesel prices and fixed to floating interest rate swap
    contracts designated as fair value hedges to provide balance to
    the Company’s mix of fixed and floating rate debt. The fair
    value of derivative contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges are
    reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. To the
    extent these hedges are effective in offsetting forecasted cash
    flows from production costs (the “effective portion”),
    changes in fair value are deferred in

Accumulated

other comprehensive income

. Amounts deferred in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

are reclassified
    to

Costs applicable to sales

, as applicable, when the
    hedged transaction has occurred. The ineffective portion of the
    change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in

Other income, net

in each period. Cash transactions
    related to the Company’s derivative contracts accounted for
    as hedges are classified in the same category as the item being
    hedged in the statement of cash flows.

When derivative contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges are
    settled, accelerated or restructured before the maturity date of
    the contracts, the related amount in

Accumulated other
    comprehensive income

at the settlement date is deferred and
    reclassified to earnings, as applicable, when the originally
    designated hedged transaction impacts earnings.

The fair value of derivative contracts qualifying as fair value
    hedges are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance
    sheet. Changes in fair value are recorded in income in each
    period, consistent with recording changes to the

mark-to-market

value of the underlying hedged asset or liability in income.
    Changes in the

mark-to-market

value of the effective portion of interest rate swaps utilized
    by the Company to swap a portion of its fixed rate interest rate
    risk to floating rate risk are recognized as a component of

Interest expense, net

.

Newmont assesses the effectiveness of the derivative contracts
    periodically using either regression analysis or the dollar
    offset approach, both retrospectively and prospectively, to
    determine whether the hedging instruments have been highly
    effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged
    items. The Company will also assess periodically whether the
    hedging instruments are expected to be highly effective in the
    future. If a hedging instrument is not expected to be highly
    effective, the Company will stop hedge accounting prospectively.
    In those instances, the gains or losses remain in

Accumulated
    other comprehensive income

until the hedged item affects
    earnings.

The ASC guidance for derivatives and hedging was updated for
    enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments, how derivative instruments and the related hedged
    items are accounted for, and how derivative instruments and the
    related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance and cash flows. The Company adopted the
    updated guidance on January 1, 2009.

Net Income per
    Common Share

Basic and diluted income per share are presented for

Net
    income attributable to Newmont stockholders

and for

Income from continuing operations attributable to Newmont
    stockholders

. Basic income per share is computed by dividing
    income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
    number of outstanding common shares for the period, including
    the exchangeable shares (see Notes 14 and 23). Diluted
    income per share reflects the potential dilution that could
    occur if securities or other contracts that may require the
    issuance of common shares in the future were converted. Diluted
    income per share is computed by increasing the weighted-average
    number of outstanding common shares to include the additional
    common shares that would be outstanding after conversion and
    adjusting net income for changes that would result from the
    conversion. Only those securities or other contracts that result
    in a reduction in earnings per share are included in the
    calculation.

Comprehensive
    Income

In addition to

Net income, Comprehensive income (loss)

includes all changes in equity during a period, such as
    adjustments to minimum pension liabilities, foreign currency
    translation adjustments, the effective portion of changes in

Variable Interest
    Entities

In June 2009, the ASC guidance for consolidation accounting was
    updated to require an entity to perform a qualitative analysis
    to determine whether the enterprise’s variable interest
    gives it a controlling financial interest in a VIE. This
    qualitative analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE
    as the entity that has both of the following characteristics:
    (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and
    (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits
    from the entity that could potentially be significant to the
    VIE. The updated guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of
    the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Adoption of the updated
    guidance, effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2010, had no impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Fair Value
    Accounting

In January 2010, ASC guidance for fair value measurements and
    disclosure was updated to require additional disclosures related
    to transfers in and out of level 1 and 2 fair value
    measurements. The guidance was amended to clarify the level of
    disaggregation required for assets and liabilities and the
    disclosures required for inputs and valuation techniques used to
    measure the fair value of assets and liabilities that fall in
    either level 2 or level 3. The updated guidance was
    effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2010. The adoption had no impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 16 for further
    details regarding the Company’s assets and liabilities
    measured at fair value.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Business
    Combinations

In December 2010, the ASC guidance for business combinations was
    updated to clarify existing guidance which requires a public
    entity to disclose pro forma revenue and earnings of the
    combined entity as though the business combination(s) that
    occurred during the current year had occurred as of the
    beginning of the comparable prior annual period only. The update
    also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures required to
    include a description of the nature and amount of material,
    nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the
    business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue
    and earnings. The updated guidance is effective for the
    Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2011. The
    Company is evaluating the potential impact of adopting this
    guidance on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

Fair Value
    Accounting

In January 2010, the ASC guidance for fair value measurements
    and disclosure was updated to require enhanced detail in the
    level 3 reconciliation. The updated guidance is effective
    for the

Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2011. The
    Company expects minimal impact from adopting this guidance.

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

The Company predominantly operates in a single industry, namely
    exploration for and production of gold. The Company’s
    reportable segments are based upon the Company’s management
    structure that is focused on the geographic region for the
    Company’s operations and include North America, South
    America, Asia Pacific, Africa and Corporate and Other. The
    Company’s major operations include Nevada, Yanacocha,
    Boddington, Batu Hijau, Other Australia/New Zealand and Ahafo.
    The Company identifies its reportable segments as those
    consolidated mining operations or functional groups that
    represent more than 10% of the combined revenue, profit or loss
    or total assets of all reported operating segments. Consolidated
    mining operations or functional groups not meeting this
    threshold are aggregated at the applicable geographic region or
    corporate level for segment reporting purposes. Earnings from
    operations do not reflect general corporate expenses, interest
    (except project-specific interest) or income and mining taxes
    (except for equity investments). Intercompany revenue and
    expense amounts have been eliminated within each segment in
    order to report on the

RECLAMATION AND
    REMEDIATION

The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject
    to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the
    protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are
    continually changing and are generally becoming more
    restrictive. The Company conducts its operations to protect
    public health and the environment and believes its operations
    are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all
    material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in
    the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and
    regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future
    expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based
    principally on legal and regulatory requirements.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, $904 and $698, respectively,
    were accrued for reclamation obligations relating to mineral
    properties. In addition, the Company is involved in several
    matters concerning environmental obligations associated with
    former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally, these
    matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at
    the various sites involved. At December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    $144 and $161, respectively, were accrued for such obligations.
    These amounts are also included in

Reclamation and
    remediation liabilities

.

Included in

Other long-term assets

at December 31,
    2010 and 2009 is $12 and $11, respectively, of restricted cash
    that is legally restricted for purposes of settling asset
    retirement obligations related to the Con mine in Yellowknife,
    NWT, Canada. Included in

Investments

at December 31,
    2010 and 2009 are $10 and $10 of long-term marketable debt
    securities, respectively, and $6 and $5 long-term marketable
    equity securities, respectively, which are legally pledged for
    purposes of settling asset retirement obligations related to the
    San Jose Reservoir in Yanacocha.

    increase in the tailings area at Kalgoorlie, increased backfill
    at Phoenix, increased activity at Hope Bay and $2 for historic
    mining operations primarily related to additional water
    management costs.

Additions to the reclamation liability in 2009 of $105 include
    $90 for currently or recently producing properties due mainly to
    increased disturbance area at Batu Hijau, post-mine backfilling
    of underground operations and an increase in the tailings area
    at Kalgoorlie, increased backfill at Phoenix and the acquisition
    of the remaining one-third of Boddington. Additions to the

Pension and
    Other Benefit Plans

The Company provides defined benefit pension plans to eligible
    employees. Benefits are generally based on years of service and
    the employee’s average annual compensation. Various
    international pension plans are based on local laws and
    requirements. Pension costs are determined annually by
    independent actuaries and pension contributions to the qualified
    plans are made based on funding standards established under the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

The Company sponsors retiree health care plans that provide
    prescription drug benefits to eligible retirees that our
    plans’ actuaries have determined are actuarially equivalent
    to Medicare Part D. The effect of the federal subsidies
    received decreased post-retirement projected accumulated benefit
    obligation (“ABO”) by $7 in 2009. In 2010, Congress
    passed certain measures of healthcare reform which changed the
    tax-free status of Medicare Part D subsidies and eliminated
    the impact on the post-retirement ABO.

Yield curves matching our benefit obligations were derived using
    a model based on high quality corporate bond data from Bloomberg
    in 2010. The model develops a discount rate by selecting a
    portfolio of high quality corporate bonds whose projected cash
    flows match the projected benefit payments of the plan. In 2009,
    the Company used yield curves modeled from cash flow analysis
    under the Citigroup Above Median Pension Discount Curve. The
    resulting curves were used to identify a discount rate for the
    Company of 5.75% and 6.10% in 2010 and 2009, respectively, based
    on the timing of future benefit payments. The decision to use 8%
    as the expected long-term return on plan assets was made based
    on an analysis of the actual plan asset returns over multiple
    time horizons and comparable other U.S. corporations. The
    average actual return on plan assets during the 22 years
    ended December 31, 2010 approximated 9%.

The pension plans employ several independent investment firms
    which invest the assets of the plans in certain approved funds
    that correspond to specific asset classes with associated target
    allocations. The goal of the pension fund investment program is
    to achieve prudent actuarial funding ratios while maintaining
    acceptable risk levels. The investment performance of the plans
    and that of the individual investment firms is measured against
    recognized market indices. The performance of the pension funds
    are monitored by an investment committee comprised of members of
    the Company’s management, which is advised by an
    independent investment consultant. With the exception of global
    capital market economic risks, the Company has identified no
    significant portfolio risks associated to asset classes. The
    following is a summary of the target asset allocations for 2010

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are classified
    within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are
    valued using quoted market prices. The cash equivalent
    instruments that are valued based on quoted market prices in
    active markets are primarily money market securities and
    U.S. Treasury securities.

The Company’s commingled fund investments are classified
    within Level 2. The funds are managed by several fund
    managers and are valued at the net asset value per share for
    each fund. Although the majority of underlying assets in the
    funds consist of actively traded equity securities and bonds,
    the unit of account is considered to be at the fund level, and
    therefore, the investments are classified as Level 2. At
    December 31, 2010, the underlying assets of the commingled
    funds consist of U.S. equity investments (40%),
    international equity investments (25%) and fixed income
    investments (35%).

The assumed health care cost trend rate to measure the expected
    cost of benefits was 8.00% for 2011, 7.25% for 2012, 6.50% for
    2013, 5.75% for 2014, and 5.00% for 2015 and each year
    thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
    significant effect on amounts reported for the health care
    plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost
    trend rates would have the following effects:

    2012, $4 in 2013, $5 in 2014, $5 in 2015, and $31 in total over
    the five years from 2015 through 2020.

Savings
    Plans

The Company has two qualified defined contribution savings
    plans, one that covers salaried and non-union hourly employees
    and one that covers substantially all hourly union employees. In
    addition, the Company has one non-qualified supplemental savings
    plan for salaried employees whose benefits under the qualified
    plan are limited by federal regulations. When an employee meets
    eligibility requirements, the Company matches 100% of employee
    contributions of up to 6% of base salary for the salaried and
    hourly union plans. Effective March 2008, the Company makes a
    contribution between 5.0% and 7.5% (based on continuous years of
    service) to each non-union hourly employee’s retirement
    contribution account at its sole discretion. Matching
    contributions are made with Newmont stock; however, no holding
    restrictions are placed on such contributions, which totaled $15
    in 2010, $15 in 2009 and $14 in 2008.

NOTE 9

STOCK BASED
    COMPENSATION

The Company has stock incentive plans for executives and
    eligible employees. Stock incentive awards include options to
    purchase shares of stock with exercise prices not less than fair
    market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant,
    restricted stock units and performance leveraged stock units. At
    December 31, 2010, 10,516,994 shares were available
    for future stock incentive plan awards.

Employee Stock
    Options

Stock options granted under the Company’s stock incentive
    plans vest over periods of three years or more and are
    exercisable over a period of time not to exceed 10 years
    from the grant date. The value of each option award is estimated
    at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
    The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of
    subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the
    option award and stock price volatility. The expected term of
    options granted is derived from historical data on employee
    exercise and post-vesting employment termination experience.
    Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our
    stock at the grant date. These estimates involve inherent
    uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment.
    In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture
    rate and only recognize expense for those options expected to
    vest. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our
    recorded stock based compensation expense would have been
    different from that reported. The Black-Scholes option pricing
    model used the following assumptions:

Other Stock
    Based Compensation

The Company grants restricted stock units to executives and
    eligible employees upon achievement of certain financial and
    operating results. Restricted stock units vest over periods of
    three years or more. Prior to vesting, holders of restricted
    stock units do not have the right to vote the underlying shares;
    however, executives accrue dividend equivalents on their
    restricted stock units, which are paid at the time the
    restricted stock units vest. The restricted stock units are
    subject to forfeiture risk and

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

other restrictions. Upon vesting, the employee is entitled to
    receive one share of the Company’s common stock for each
    restricted stock unit. In 2010, 2009 and 2008 the Company
    granted 483,408, 450,195 and 16,360 restricted stock units,
    respectively, at a weighted-average fair market value of $52,
    $42 and $39, respectively, per underlying share of the
    Company’s common stock. At December 31, 2010, 454,256,
    255,230 and 3,765 shares remain unvested for the 2010, 2009
    and 2008 grants, respectively.

The Company grants financial performance stock bonuses to
    eligible executives upon achievement of certain financial and
    operating results, based on a targeted number of shares at the
    beginning of each performance period. At the end of the
    performance period, one third of the bonus is paid in common
    stock and two-thirds of the bonus is paid in restricted stock
    units that vest in equal annual increments at the second and
    third anniversaries of the start of the performance period. In
    2010 and 2009, the Company granted 64,646 and 40,078 common
    shares, respectively, and 129,302 and 80,172 restricted stock
    units, respectively, included in the restricted stock unit
    grants above at a fair market value of $50 and $43 per
    underlying share of the Company’s common stock,
    respectively, under the financial performance stock bonus plan.

Beginning in 2010, the Company grants performance leveraged
    stock units (“PSUs”) to eligible executives. In 2010,
    the Company granted 204,732 PSUs at a weighted-average fair
    market value of $69. The actual number of PSUs earned will be
    determined at the end of a three year performance period (except
    two partial awards that will be based on a one and two year
    performance period, respectively), based upon certain measures
    of shareholder return.

Prior to 2009, the Company granted restricted stock awards to
    executives and deferred stock awards to eligible employees upon
    achievement of certain financial and operating results. Shares
    of restricted stock and deferred stock vest over periods of
    three years or more from the grant date and are subject to
    certain restrictions related to ownership and transferability
    prior to vesting. The Company no longer grants restricted stock
    or deferred stock. In 2008, 218,697 shares of restricted
    stock, were granted at a weighted-average fair market value of
    $39 per underlying share of the Company’s common stock. At
    December 31, 2010, 126,391 shares remained unvested
    for the 2008 restricted stock awards. In 2008, the Company
    granted 394,095 shares of deferred stock, at a
    weighted-average fair market value of $44 per underlying share
    of the Company’s common stock. At December 31, 2010,
    106,168 shares remained unvested for the 2008 deferred
    stock awards.

The total intrinsic value of other stock based compensation
    awards that vested in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $28, $19 and $14,
    respectively. At December 31, 2010, there was $25 of
    unrecognized compensation costs related to the unvested other
    stock based compensation awards. This cost is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
    2 years.

Factors that
    Significantly Impact Effective Tax Rate

In 2010, the Company converted certain

non-U.S. entities

to U.S. entities for U.S. income tax purposes. The
    lower effective tax rate in 2010 and 2008 is primarily due to
    tax benefits recognized as a result of “check the box”
    elections made with respect to certain of the Company’s
    non-US subsidiaries. As a result of the elections, the
    subsidiaries are treated as flow-through entities for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes. The restructurings in
    2010 resulted in the recording of a deferred tax asset,
    calculated as the difference between fair market valuations of
    the subsidiaries compared to the underlying financial statement
    basis in the assets. The restructuring in 2008 resulted in a
    significant loss that allowed the Company to recover income
    taxes paid in prior years.



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion
    that may exceed the tax basis in mineral reserves) are available
    under the income tax laws of the United States for operations
    conducted in the United States or through branches and
    partnerships owned by U.S. subsidiaries included in the
    Company’s consolidated United States income tax return. The
    deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold and other
    minerals produced by the Company.

Tax expense decreased due to the reduction in income taxes from
    revised estimates of reserves for uncertain income tax positions
    recorded in jurisdictions where either the statutes of
    limitations expired or where uncertain income tax positions were
    settled.

The reduction in valuation allowances in 2010 and 2009 are a
    result of the increase in value of certain marketable
    securities, and higher forecasted taxable income from certain
    mining operations caused by the increase in the average price of
    gold and the realization of capital loss benefits. In addition,
    $44 of the valuation allowance, when recognized, will not reduce
    the Company’s effective tax rate, but will be recorded
    directly to equity. The valuation allowance remaining at the end
    of 2010 primarily is attributable to

non-U.S. subsidiaries

tax loss carryforwards.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company reclassified certain
    income based state and provincial taxes from

Costs applicable
    to sales

to

Income and mining tax expense

. Tax
    expense increased due to the inclusion of such taxes as

Income and mining tax expense

. The reclassification
    resulted in $33, $27 and $27 (net of federal benefit) increases
    to income and mining taxes for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Other

Newmont intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from certain
    foreign operations. Accordingly, U.S. and

non-U.S. income

and withholding taxes for which deferred taxes might otherwise
    be required, have not been provided on a cumulative amount of
    temporary differences (including, for this purpose, any
    difference between the tax basis in the stock of a consolidated
    subsidiary and the amount of the subsidiary’s net equity
    determined for financial reporting purposes) related to
    investments in foreign subsidiaries of approximately $7 and $117
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease
    shown above is due to the change in the Company’s assertion
    regarding unremitted earnings that resulted from the conversion
    of

non-U.S. entities

to U.S. entities in 2010. As such, deferred taxes are now
    being provided for the foreign operations included in the
    restructuring.

Company’s
    Unrecognized Tax Benefits

At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company had $116,
    $130 and $181 of total gross unrecognized tax benefits,

At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, $45, $63 and $116,
    respectively, represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits
    that, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective
    income tax rate.

The Company operates in numerous countries around the world and
    accordingly it is subject to, and pays annual income taxes
    under, the various income tax regimes in the countries in which
    it operates. Some of these tax regimes are defined by
    contractual agreements with the local government, and others are
    defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country.
    The Company has historically filed, and continues to file, all
    required income tax returns and paid the taxes reasonably
    determined to be due. The tax rules and regulations in many
    countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. From
    time to time, the Company is subject to a review of its historic
    income tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes
    can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or
    application of certain rules to the Company’s business
    conducted within the country involved.

On June 25, 2008, the United States Tax Court issued an
    opinion for Santa Fe Pacific Gold Company and Subsidiaries
    (“Santa Fe”), by and through its successor in
    interest, Newmont USA Limited, a member of the Newmont Mining
    Corporation affiliated group. The Tax Court issued the ruling
    for the tax years 1994 through 1997, which were years prior to
    Newmont’s acquisition of Santa Fe. The Tax Court ruled
    unfavorably on certain issues relating to the method in which
    Santa Fe was calculating adjustments related to percentage
    depletion in its Alternative Minimum Tax calculation. On
    April 27, 2009, the United States Tax Court issued a
    decision in favor of Santa Fe, with respect to the
    $65 million Homestake

break-up

fee
    deducted by Santa Fe in tax year 1997. Following procedural
    rules, the Internal Revenue Service was given 90 days from
    the date the decision was entered in which to file an appeal.
    The entry of decision was made on July 16, 2009. The
    Internal Revenue Service did not file an appeal, and as a
    result, as of October 15, 2009 the decision stands. The
    result of this decision resulted in overpayments for each of the
    tax years 1994 through 1997. The Company has adjusted the
    unrecognized tax benefits accordingly.

In 2010, PTNNT, the Company’s partially owned subsidiary in
    Indonesia, received a final tax assessment from the Indonesian
    Tax Office. Although required to pay $132 (of which, $119
    related to corporate income tax matters) of tax and penalties
    upon receipt of the tax assessment, PTNNT intends to vigorously
    defend its positions through all processes available to it.
    PTNNT believes it is more likely than not that it will prevail
    based on prior experience and therefore recorded a corresponding
    receivable in the third quarter.

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns
    in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and
    foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no
    longer subject to U.S. Federal, state and local, and

non-U.S. income

tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2005. As a
    result of (i) statute of limitations that will begin to
    expire within the next 12 months in various jurisdictions,
    and (ii) possible settlements of audit-related issues with
    taxing authorities in various jurisdictions with respect to
    which none of the issues are individually significant, the
    Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total
    amount of its net unrecognized income tax benefits will decrease
    between $1 to $3 in the next 12 months.

The Company’s continuing practice is to recognize interest

and/or

penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its
    income and mining tax expense. At December 31, 2010 and
    2009, the total amount of accrued income-tax-related interest
    and penalties included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was
    $10 and $13, respectively. During 2010, the Company released
    through the Statements of Consolidated Income $4 of interest and
    penalties. During 2009 and 2008, the Company accrued through the
    Statements of Consolidated Income an additional $9 and $31 of
    interest and penalties.

    forwards, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, $857
    and $1,020, respectively, of net operating loss carry forwards
    are attributable to operations in Australia, Ghana and France
    for which current tax law provides no expiration period. The
    remaining net operating loss carryforwards expire at various
    dates through 2030. Valuation allowances have been recorded on
    net operating loss carryforwards where the Company believes
    based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that
    the net operating losses will not be realized.

Tax credit carry forwards for 2010 and 2009 of $53 and $158
    consist of foreign tax credits available in the United States;
    substantially all such credits not utilized will expire at the
    end of 2018. Other credit carry forwards at the end of 2010 and
    2009 in the amounts of $115 and $121, respectively, represent
    alternative minimum tax credits attributable to the
    Company’s U.S. operations for which the current tax
    law provides no period of expiration.

Differences in tax rates and other foreign income tax law
    variations make the ability to fully utilize all available
    foreign income tax credits on a

year-by-year

basis highly dependent on the price of the gold and copper
    produced by the Company and the costs of production, since lower
    prices or higher costs can result in having insufficient sources
    of taxable income in the United States to utilize all available
    foreign tax credits. Such credits have limited carry back and
    carry forward periods and can only be used to reduce the United
    States income tax imposed on foreign earnings included in the
    annual United States consolidated income tax return.

AGR Matthey
    Joint Venture

The AGR Matthey Joint Venture (“AGR”), a gold
    refinery, in which Newmont held a 40% interest, was dissolved on
    March 30, 2010. Newmont received consideration of $14 from
    the dissolution and recorded a gain of $6 during 2010. Newmont
    received dividends of $7 and $2 during 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, from its interests in AGR. See also Note 26
    for details of Newmont’s transactions with AGR.

Regis
    Resources Ltd.

Prior to December 2009, Newmont held a 23.15% interest in Regis
    Resources Ltd. (“Regis Resources”). On
    December 22, 2009, Regis Resources issued common shares
    through a rights issue. As a result, Newmont’s ownership
    interest in Regis Resources was diluted and the Company
    discontinued equity accounting.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

Discontinued operations include Kori Kollo sold in July 2009 and
    various other operations sold to third parties.

In December 2010, the Company recognized a $28 charge, net of
    tax benefits, for legal claims related to historic operations
    previously sold to third parties.

In July 2009, the Company sold its interest in Kori Kollo in
    Bolivia. As part of the transaction, a reclamation trust fund
    was established with the proceeds to be made available
    exclusively to pay for closure and reclamation costs when
    operations eventually cease. The Company recognized a $16 charge
    in 2009, net of tax benefits, related to the sale.

Newmont has accounted for these dispositions in accordance with
    accounting guidance for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
    assets. The Company has reclassified the income statement

In June 2010, PTPI completed the sale of an approximate 2.2%
    interest in PTNNT to PTIMI. To enable the transaction to
    proceed, the Company released its rights to the dividends
    payable on this 2.2% interest and released the security interest
    in the associated shares. The Company further agreed, however,
    to advance certain funds to PTIMI to enable it to purchase the
    interest in exchange for an assignment by PTIMI to the Company
    of the dividends payable on the 2.2% interest (net of
    withholding tax), a pledge of the shares as security on the
    advance, and certain voting rights and obligations. The funds
    that the Company advanced to PTIMI and which it paid to PTPI for
    the shares were used by PTPI to reduce its outstanding balance
    with the Company. Upon completion of this transaction, PTPI
    requested and was allowed to borrow additional funds under the
    Company’s agreement with PTPI. The Company’s economic
    interest in PTPI’s and PTIMI’s combined 20% interest
    in PTNNT remains at 17% and has not changed as a result of these
    transactions.

In March 2010, the Company (through NTP) completed the sale and
    transfer of shares for a 7% interest in PTNNT, the Indonesian
    subsidiary that operates Batu Hijau, to PT Multi Daerah Bersaing
    (“PTMDB”) in compliance with divestiture obligations
    under the Contract of Work, reducing NTP’s ownership
    interest to 56% from 63%. In 2009, the Company (through NTP)
    completed the sale and

    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

transfer of shares for a 17% interest in PTNNT to PTMDB in
    compliance with divestiture obligations under the Contract of
    Work, reducing NTP’s ownership interest to 63% from 80%.
    The 2010 and 2009 share transfers resulted in gains of
    approximately $16 (after tax of $33) and $63 (after tax of
    $115), respectively, that were recorded as

Additional paid-in
    capital

. For information on the Batu Hijau Contract of Work
    and divestiture requirements, see the discussion in Note 31
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2009, the Company entered into a transaction with
    PTPI, whereby the Company agreed to advance certain funds to
    PTPI in exchange for a pledge of the noncontrolling
    partner’s 20% share of PTNNT dividends, net of withholding
    tax, and certain voting rights and obligations, and a commitment
    from PTPI to support the application of Newmont’s standards
    to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine. Based on the
    transaction with PTPI, the Company recognized an additional 17%
    effective economic interest in PTNNT.

At December 31, 2010, Newmont had a 48.50% effective
    economic interest in PTNNT. Based on ASC guidance for variable
    interest entities, Newmont continues to consolidate PTNNT in its
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Newmont has a 51.35% ownership interest in Yanacocha, with the
    remaining interests held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura,
    S.A.A. (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%).

Newmont Common
    Stock

In October 2007, Newmont filed a shelf registration statement on

Form S-3

under which it can issue an indeterminate number or amount of
    common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of
    debt securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate
    prices. It also included the resale of an indeterminate amount
    of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time
    to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible
    securities.

Treasury
    Stock

Treasury stock is acquired by the Company when certain
    restricted stock awards vest or are forfeited (see Note 9).
    At vesting, a participant has a tax liability and, pursuant to
    the participant’s award agreement, may elect withholding of
    restricted stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The
    withheld or forfeited stock is accounted for as treasury stock
    and carried at the par value of the related common stock.

Exchangeable
    Shares

In connection with the acquisition of Franco-Nevada Corporation
    (“Franco”) in February 2002, certain holders of Franco
    common stock received 0.8 of an exchangeable share of Newmont
    Mining Corporation of Canada Limited (formerly Franco) for each
    share of common stock held. These exchangeable shares are
    convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of Newmont
    common stock on a

one-for-one

basis, and entitle holders to dividends and other rights
    economically equivalent to holders of Newmont common stock. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the value of these no-par
    shares was included in

Additional paid-in capital

Options to purchase 2 million, 4 million and
    4 million shares of common stock at average exercise prices
    of $57, $47 and $48 were outstanding at December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, but were not included in the
    computation of diluted weighted average number of common shares
    because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

In February 2009 and July 2007, Newmont issued $518 and $1,150,
    respectively, of convertible notes that, if converted in the
    future, would have a potentially dilutive effect on the
    Company’s stock. The notes issued in 2009 and 2007 are
    convertible, at the holder’s option, equivalent to a
    conversion price of $46.18 per share of common stock
    (11,206,150 shares of common stock) and $46.13 per share of
    common stock (24,929,547 shares of common stock),
    respectively. Under the indentures for the convertible notes,
    upon conversion Newmont is required to settle the principal
    amount of the convertible notes in cash and may elect to settle
    the remaining conversion obligation (stock price in excess of
    the conversion price) in cash, shares or a combination thereof.
    The effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted
    earnings per share is calculated under the net share settlement
    method in accordance with ASC guidance. The average price of the
    Company’s common stock for the year ended December 31,
    2010 exceeded the conversion price of $46.18 and $46.13 for the
    notes issued in 2009 and 2007, respectively, and therefore,
    6 million additional shares were included in the
    computation of diluted weighted average common shares for the
    year ended December 31, 2010.



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In connection with the 2007 convertible senior notes offering,
    the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions and
    warrant transactions (“Call Spread Transactions”).
    These transactions included the purchase of call options and the
    sale of warrants. As a result of the Call Spread Transactions,
    the conversion price of $46.13 was effectively increased to
    $60.17. Should the warrant transactions become dilutive to the
    Company’s earnings per share (i.e. Newmont’s share
    price exceeds $60.17) the underlying shares will be included in
    the computation of diluted income per common share.

ACQUISITIONS

On June 25, 2009 the Company completed the acquisition of
    the remaining 33.33% interest in Boddington from AngloGold
    Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Consideration
    for the acquisition consisted of $982 and a contingent royalty
    capped at $100, equal to 50% of the average realized operating
    margin (Revenue less

Costs applicable to sales

on a
    by-product basis), if any, exceeding $600 per ounce, payable
    quarterly beginning in the second quarter of 2010 on one-third
    of gold sales from Boddington. At the acquisition date, the
    Company estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration
    at $62. In connection with the acquisition, the Company incurred
    $67 of transaction costs in 2009 of which $15 of these costs
    were paid at December 31, 2010.

At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the fair
    value of the contingent consideration was valued to
    approximately $83 and $85, respectively. Changes to the
    estimated fair value resulting from periodic revaluations are
    recorded to

FAIR VALUE
    ACCOUNTING

Fair value accounting establishes a fair value hierarchy that
    prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
    fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to
    unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest
    priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The
    three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible
    at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or
    liabilities;

Level 2

Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are
    observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
    full term of the asset or liability; and

Level 3

Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both
    significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable
    (supported by little or no market activity).



NEWMONT MINING

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table sets forth the Company’s assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at
    least annually) by level within the fair value hierarchy. As
    required by accounting guidance, assets and liabilities are

The Company’s cash equivalent instruments are classified
    within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are
    valued using quoted market prices. The cash equivalent
    instruments that are valued based on quoted market prices in
    active markets are primarily money market securities and
    U.S. Treasury securities.

The Company’s marketable equity securities are valued using
    quoted market prices in active markets and as such are
    classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The
    securities are segregated based on industry. The fair value of
    the marketable equity securities is calculated as the quoted
    market price of the marketable equity security multiplied by the
    quantity of shares held by the Company.

The Company’s marketable debt securities include
    investments in auction rate securities and asset backed
    commercial paper. The Company reviews the fair value for auction
    rate securities and asset backed commercial paper on at least a
    quarterly basis. The auction rate securities are traded in
    markets that are not active, trade infrequently and have little
    price transparency. The Company estimated the fair value of the
    auction rate securities based on weighted average risk
    calculations using probabilistic cash flow assumptions. In
    January 2009, the investments in the Company’s asset backed
    commercial paper were restructured by court order. The
    restructuring allowed an interest distribution to be made to
    investors. The Company estimated the fair value of the asset
    backed

commercial paper using a probability of return to each class of
    notes reflective of information reviewed regarding the separate
    classes of securities. The auction rate securities and asset
    backed commercial paper are classified within Level 3 of
    the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s corporate
    marketable debt securities are valued using quoted market prices
    in active markets and as such are classified within Level 1
    of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company’s net trade receivable from provisional copper
    and gold concentrate sales, subject to final pricing, is valued
    using quoted market prices based on forward curves and, as such,
    is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company’s derivative instruments are valued using
    pricing models and the Company generally uses similar models to
    value similar instruments. Valuation models require a variety of
    inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield
    curves, credit spreads, measures of volatility, and correlations
    of such inputs. The Company’s derivatives trade in liquid
    markets, and as such, model inputs can generally be verified and
    do not involve significant management judgment. Such instruments
    are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company has fixed to floating swap contracts to hedge a
    portion of the interest rate risk exposure of its


/


% debentures
    due May 2011. The hedged portion of the Company’s


/


% debentures
    are valued using pricing models which require inputs, including
    risk-free interest rates and credit spreads. Because the inputs
    are derived from observable market data, the hedged portion of
    the


/


% debentures
    is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company recorded a contingent consideration liability
    related to the 2009 acquisition of the final 33.33% interest in
    Boddington. The value of the contingent consideration was
    determined using a valuation model which simulates future gold
    and copper prices and costs applicable to sales to estimate fair
    value. The contingent consideration liability is classified
    within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See
    Note 15.

gold and copper sales. Newmont continues to manage certain risks
    associated with commodity input costs, interest rates and
    foreign currencies using the derivative market. All of the cash
    flow and fair value derivative instruments described below were
    transacted for risk management purposes and qualify as hedging
    instruments. The maximum period over which hedged transactions
    are expected to occur is five years.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

The foreign currency and diesel contracts are designated as cash
    flow hedges, and as such, the effective portion of unrealized
    changes in market value have been recorded in

Accumulated
    other comprehensive income

and are reclassified to income
    during the period in which the hedged transaction affects
    earnings. Gains and losses from hedge ineffectiveness are
    recognized in current earnings.

Foreign Currency
    Contracts

Newmont utilizes foreign currency contracts to reduce the
    variability of the US dollar amount of forecasted foreign
    currency expenditures caused by changes in exchange rates.
    Newmont hedges a portion of the Company’s A$ and NZ$
    denominated operating expenditures which results in a blended

    forward contracts with expiration dates ranging up to five years
    from the date of issue. The principal hedging objective is

Treasury Rate
    Lock Contracts

In connection with the 2019 and 2039 notes issued in September
    2009, Newmont acquired treasury rate lock contracts to reduce
    the variability of the proceeds realized from the bond
    issuances. The treasury rate locks resulted in $6 and $5
    unrealized gains for the 2019 and 2039 notes, respectively. The
    Company previously acquired treasury rate locks in connection
    with the issuance of the 2035 notes that resulted in a $10
    unrealized loss. The gains/losses from these contracts are
    recognized in

    Swap Contracts

At December 31, 2010, Newmont had $222 fixed to floating
    swap contracts designated as a hedge against its

    due 2011. The interest rate swap contracts assist in managing
    the Company’s mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Under
    the hedge contract terms, Newmont receives fixed-rate interest
    payments at 8.63% and pays floating-rate interest amounts based
    on periodic London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
    settings plus a spread, ranging from 2.60% to 7.63%. The
    interest rate swap contracts were designated as fair value
    hedges and changes in fair value have been recorded in income in
    each period, consistent with recording changes to the

mark-to-market

value of the underlying hedged liability in income.

Provisional
    Copper and Gold Sales

The Company’s provisional copper and gold sales contain an
    embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the
    host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the
    receivable from the sale of the gold and copper concentrates at
    the prevailing indices’ prices at the time of sale. The
    embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge
    accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period
    prior to final settlement.

The average LME copper price was $3.43 per pound during 2010,
    compared with the Company’s recorded average provisional
    price of $3.42 before

mark-to-market

gains and treatment and refining charges. During 2010,
    increasing copper prices resulted in a provisional pricing

mark-to-market

gain of $120 ($0.22 per pound). At December 31, 2010,
    Newmont had copper sales of 111 million pounds priced at an
    average of $4.40 per pound, subject to final pricing over the
    next several months.

The average London P.M. fix for gold was $1,225 per ounce during
    2010, compared with the Company’s recorded average
    provisional price of $1,224 per ounce before

mark-to-market

gains and treatment and refining charges. During 2010,
    increasing gold prices resulted in a provisional pricing

mark-to-market

gain of $41 ($7 per ounce). At December 31, 2010, Newmont
    had gold sales of 105,000 ounces priced at an average of $1,411
    per ounce, subject to final pricing over the next several months.

    respectively, and $6 and $5 long-term marketable equity
    securities, respectively, which are legally pledged for purposes
    of settling asset retirement obligations related to the
    San Jose Reservoir in Yanacocha.

On December 21, 2010 Newmont exercised 6 million
    warrants of New Gold Inc. and received 6 million New Gold
    Inc. shares for consideration of $5.

In March 2010, Regis Resources issued A$10 interest free
    convertible notes to Newmont which were repayable by
    December 31, 2012 and 5 million options. On
    September 30, 2010, Newmont accepted the offer to terminate
    its equity participation right on all Regis Resources tenements
    in return for 9 million Regis Resources shares upon
    conversion of the interest free convertible notes. This
    conversion resulted in a gain of approximately $5. On
    October 26, 2010, Newmont exercised the options and
    received 5 million Regis Resources shares for consideration
    of $4.

During 2010, the Company purchased $15 and exercised warrants
    for $4 of other marketable equity securities. During 2009, the
    Company purchased $5 of Regis Resources shares.

AGR, in which the Company held a 40% equity interest, was
    dissolved on March 30, 2010. The Company received

    temporary. The Company intends to hold its investment in auction
    rate securities and asset backed commercial paper until maturity
    or such time that the market recovers and therefore considers
    these losses temporary.

Sale-Leaseback
    of Refractory Ore Treatment Plant

In September 1994, the Company entered into a sale and leaseback
    agreement for its refractory ore treatment plant located in
    Carlin, Nevada. The lease term is 21 years and aggregate
    future minimum lease payments, which include interest, were $190
    and $226 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    Future minimum lease payments are $39 in 2011, $70 in 2012, $36
    in 2013, $36 in 2014 and $9 in 2015. The lease includes purchase
    options during and at the end of the lease at predetermined
    prices. The interest rate on this sale-leaseback transaction is
    6.36%. In connection with this transaction, the Company entered
    into certain interest rate hedging contracts that were settled
    for a gain of $11, which is recognized as a reduction of
    interest expense over the term of the lease. Including this
    gain, the effective interest rate on the borrowing is 6.15%. The
    related asset is specialized, therefore it is not practicable to
    estimate the fair value of this debt.



/


% Senior
    Notes

Newmont has outstanding uncollateralized senior notes with a
    principal amount of $223 due May 2011 bearing an annual interest
    rate of 8.63%. Interest is paid semi-annually in May and
    November and the senior notes are redeemable prior to maturity
    under certain conditions. Newmont has contracts to hedge the
    interest rate risk exposure on $222 of these senior notes. The
    Company receives fixed-rate interest payments at 8.63% and pays
    floating-rate interest based on periodic London Interbank
    Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) settings plus a spread, ranging
    from 2.60% to 7.63% (see Note 17). Using prevailing
    interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value
    of these senior notes was $228 and $242 at December 31,
    2010, and 2009, respectively. The foregoing fair value estimate
    was prepared with the assistance of an independent third party
    and may or may not reflect the actual trading value of this debt.



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Corporate
    Revolving Credit Facility

The Company has an uncollateralized $2,000 revolving credit
    facility with a syndicate of commercial banks, which matures in
    April 2012. The facility contains a letter of credit

sub-facility.

Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the credit
    ratings of the Company’s senior, uncollateralized,
    long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest at
    an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.28% or the
    lead bank’s prime interest rate. The margin adjusts as the
    Company’s credit rating changes. Facility fees accrue at an
    annual rate of 0.07% of the aggregate commitments. The Company
    also pays a utilization fee of 0.05% on the amount of revolving
    credit loans and letters of credit outstanding under the
    facility for each day on which the sum of such loans and letters
    of credit exceed 50% of the commitments under the facility.
    There was $153 and $452 outstanding under the letter of credit

sub-facility

at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no borrowings
    outstanding under the facility.

    Convertible Senior Notes

In February 2009, the Company issued $518 of uncollateralized
    convertible senior notes maturing on February 15, 2012 for
    net proceeds of $504. The notes pay interest semi-annually at a
    rate of 3.0% per annum and the effective interest rate is 8.5%.
    The notes are convertible, at the holder’s option,
    equivalent to a conversion price of $46.18 per share of common
    stock. Upon conversion, the principle amount and all accrued
    interest will be repaid in cash and any conversion premium will
    be settled in shares of our common stock or, at our election,
    cash or any combination of cash and shares of our common stock.
    When the conversion premium is dilutive to the Company’s
    earnings per share (Newmont’s share price exceeds $46.18)
    the shares are included in the computation of diluted income per
    common share. The Company is not entitled to redeem the notes
    prior to their stated maturity dates. Using prevailing interest
    rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value of these
    senior notes was $668 and $580 at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively. The foregoing fair value estimates were
    prepared with the assistance of an independent third party and
    may or may not reflect the actual trading value of this debt.

2014 and 2017
    Convertible Senior Notes

In July 2007, the Company issued $1,150 uncollateralized
    convertible senior notes due in 2014 and 2017, each with a
    principal amount of $575 for net proceeds of $1,126. The 2014
    notes, maturing on July 15, 2014, pay interest
    semi-annually at a rate of 1.25% per annum, and the 2017 notes,
    maturing on July 15, 2017, pay interest semi-annually at a
    rate of 1.63% per annum. The effective interest rates are 6.0%
    and 6.25% for the 2014 and 2017 notes, respectively. The notes
    are convertible, at the holder’s option, at a conversion
    price of $46.13 per share of common stock. Upon conversion, the
    principle amount and all accrued interest will be repaid in cash
    and any conversion premium will be settled in shares of our
    common stock or, at our election, cash or any combination of
    cash and shares of our common stock. In connection with the
    convertible senior notes offering, the Company entered into Call
    Spread Transactions. The Call Spread Transactions included the
    purchase of call options and the sale of warrants. As a result
    of the Call Spread Transactions, the conversion price of $46.13
    was effectively increased to $60.17. When the conversion premium
    and call spread transactions is dilutive to the Company’s

    The remaining unamortized debt discount is amortized over the
    remaining two, four and seven year periods of the 2012, 2014 and
    2017 convertible senior notes, respectively. At
    December 31, 2010, the if-converted value of the 2012,
    2014, and 2017 convertible senior notes exceeded the related

    respectively. Net proceeds from the 2019 and 2039 notes were
    $895 and $1,080, respectively. The 2019 notes pay interest
    semi-annually at a rate of 5.13% per annum and the 2039 notes
    pay semi-annual interest of 6.25% per annum. Using prevailing
    interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value

    respectively, at December 31, 2010 and $901 and $1,080,

In March 2005, Newmont issued uncollateralized senior notes with
    a principal amount of $600 due April 2035 bearing an annual
    interest rate of

NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NOTE 31

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES

General

The Company follows ASC guidance in determining its accruals and
    disclosures with respect to loss contingencies. Accordingly,
    estimated losses from loss contingencies are accrued by a charge
    to income when information available prior to issuance of the
    financial statements indicates that it is probable (greater than
    a 75% probability) that a liability could be incurred and the
    amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal expenses
    associated with the contingency are expensed as incurred. If a
    loss contingency is not probable or reasonably estimable,
    disclosure of the loss contingency is made in the financial
    statements when it is at least reasonably possible that a
    material loss could be incurred.

Operating
    Segments

The Company’s operating segments are identified in
    Note 3. Except as noted in this paragraph, all of the
    Company’s commitments and contingencies specifically
    described in this Note 31 relate to the Corporate and Other
    reportable segment. The PT Newmont Minahasa Raya matters relate
    to the Asia Pacific reportable segment. The Yanacocha matters
    relate to the South America reportable segment. The PTNNT
    matters relate to the Asia Pacific reportable segment.

Environmental
    Matters

The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject
    to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the
    environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing
    and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company
    conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and
    environment and believes its operations are in compliance with
    applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The
    Company has made, and expects to make in the future,
    expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but
    cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.

Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on
    legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2010 and
    2009, $904 and $698, respectively, were accrued for reclamation
    costs relating to currently producing mineral properties in
    accordance with asset retirement obligation guidance. The
    current portions of $46 and $36 at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively, are included in

Other current
    liabilities

.

In addition, the Company is involved in several matters
    concerning environmental obligations associated with former
    mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing
    and implementing remediation plans at the various sites
    involved. The Company believes that the related environmental
    obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature
    with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk
    profile and the compliance required to meet general
    environmental standards. Based upon the Company’s best
    estimate of its liability for these matters, $144 and $161 were
    accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. These amounts are included in

Other current
    liabilities

and

Reclamation and remediation
    liabilities

. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these
    matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible
    that the liability for these matters could be as much as 164%
    greater or 4% lower than the amount accrued at December 31,
    2010. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed
    periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the
    time. Changes in estimates are recorded in

Reclamation and
    remediation

in the period estimates are revised.

Details about certain of the more significant matters involved
    are discussed below.



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Dawn Mining
    Company LLC (“Dawn”) — 51% Newmont
    Owned

Midnite Mine Site.

Dawn previously leased an
    open pit uranium mine, currently inactive, on the Spokane Indian
    Reservation in the State of Washington. The mine site is subject
    to regulation by agencies of the U.S. Department of
    Interior (the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land
    Management), as well as the United States Environmental
    Protection Agency (“EPA”).

In 1991, Dawn’s mining lease at the mine was terminated. As
    a result, Dawn was required to file a formal mine closure and
    reclamation plan. The Department of Interior commenced an
    analysis of Dawn’s proposed plan and alternate closure and
    reclamation plans for the mine. Work on this analysis has been
    suspended indefinitely. In mid-2000, the mine was included on
    the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
    (“CERCLA”). In March 2003, the EPA notified Dawn and
    Newmont that it had thus far expended $12 on the Remedial
    Investigation/Feasibility Study (“RI/FS”) under
    CERCLA. In October 2005, the EPA issued the RI/FS on this
    property in which it indicated a preferred remedy that it
    estimated to cost approximately $150. Newmont and Dawn filed
    comments on the RI/FS with the EPA in January 2006. On
    October 3, 2006, the EPA issued a final Record of Decision
    in which it formally selected the preferred remedy identified in
    the RI/FS.

On January 28, 2005, the EPA filed a lawsuit against Dawn
    and Newmont under CERCLA in the U.S. District Court for the
    Eastern District of Washington. The EPA has asserted that Dawn
    and Newmont are liable for reclamation or remediation work and
    costs at the mine. Dawn does not have sufficient funds to pay
    for the reclamation plan it proposed or for any alternate plan,
    or for any additional remediation work or costs at the mine.

On July 14, 2008, after a bench trial, the Court held
    Newmont liable under CERCLA as an “operator” of the
    Midnite Mine. The Court previously ruled on summary judgment
    that both the U.S. Government and Dawn were liable under
    CERCLA. On October 17, 2008 the Court issued its written
    decision in the bench trial. The Court found Dawn and Newmont
    jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for past and future
    response costs, and ruled that each of Dawn and Newmont are
    responsible to pay one-third of such costs. The Court also found
    the U.S. Government liable on Dawn’s and
    Newmont’s contribution claim, and ruled that the
    U.S. Government is responsible to pay one-third of all past
    and future response costs. In November 2008, all parties
    appealed the Court’s ruling. Also in November 2008, the EPA
    issued an Administrative Order pursuant to Section 106 of
    CERCLA ordering Dawn and Newmont to conduct water treatment,
    testing and other preliminary remedial actions. Newmont has
    initiated those preliminary remedial actions.

Newmont intends to continue to vigorously defend this matter and
    cannot reasonably predict the outcome of this lawsuit or the
    likelihood of any other action against Dawn or Newmont arising
    from this matter.

Dawn Mill Site.

Dawn also owns a uranium mill
    site facility, located on private land near Ford, Washington,
    which is subject to state and federal regulation. In late 1999,
    Dawn sought and later received approval from the State of
    Washington for a revised closure plan that expedites the
    reclamation process at the site. The currently approved plan for
    the site is guaranteed by Newmont.

Newmont Canada
    Corporation (“Newmont Canada”) — 100%
    Newmont Owned

On November 11, 2008, St.

Andrew
    Goldfields Ltd. (“St. Andrew”) filed an Application in
    the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada, seeking a
    declaration to clarify St. Andrew’s royalty obligations
    regarding certain mineral rights and property formerly owned by
    Newmont Canada and now owned by St. Andrew.



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Newmont Canada purchased the property, called the Holt-McDermott
    property (“Holt Property”), from Barrick Gold
    Corporation (“Barrick”) in October 2004. At that time,
    Newmont Canada entered into a royalty agreement with Barrick
    (the “Barrick Royalty”), allowing Barrick to retain a
    royalty on the Holt Property. In August 2006, Newmont Canada
    sold all of its interests in the Holt Property to Holloway
    Mining Company (“Holloway”) in exchange for common
    stock issued by Holloway. In September 2006, Newmont Canada
    entered into a purchase and sale agreement with St. Andrew (the
    “2006 Agreement”), under which St. Andrew acquired all
    the common stock of Holloway. In 2008, Barrick sold its Barrick
    Royalty to Royal Gold, Inc. (“Royal Gold”).

In the court proceedings, St. Andrew alleged that in the 2006
    Agreement it only agreed to assume royalty obligations equal to
    0.013% of net smelter returns from operations on the Holt
    Property. Such an interpretation of the 2006 Agreement would
    make Newmont responsible for any royalties exceeding that amount
    payable to Royal Gold pursuant to the Barrick Royalty, which is
    a royalty determined by multiplying 0.00013 by the quarterly
    average gold price. On July 23, 2009, the Superior Court
    issued a decision finding in favor of St. Andrews’
    interpretation. On August 21, 2009, Newmont Canada appealed
    the decision. If the Court of Appeals upholds the lower court
    ruling, Newmont will be liable for the sliding scale royalty,
    which would equal a 13% royalty at a quarterly average gold
    price of $1,000, minus a 0.013% of net smelter returns. There is
    no cap on the royalty at issue and it increases or decreases
    with the gold price, based upon the multiplication of 0.00013 by
    the quarterly average gold price. Newmont Canada intends to
    continue to vigorously defend this matter but cannot reasonably
    predict the outcome.

Newmont USA
    Limited — 100% Newmont Owned

Grey Eagle Mine Site.

By letter dated
    September 3, 2002, the EPA notified Newmont that the EPA
    had expended $3 in response costs to address environmental
    conditions associated with a historic tailings pile located at
    the Grey Eagle Mine site near Happy Camp, California, and
    requested that Newmont pay those costs. The EPA has identified
    four potentially responsible parties, including Newmont. Newmont
    does not believe it has any liability for environmental
    conditions at the Grey Eagle Mine site, and intends to
    vigorously defend any formal claims by the EPA. Newmont cannot
    reasonably predict the likelihood or outcome of any future
    action against it arising from this matter.

Ross-Adams Mine Site.

By letter dated
    June 5, 2007, the U.S. Forest Service notified Newmont
    that it had expended approximately $0.3 in response costs to
    address environmental conditions at the Ross-Adams mine in
    Prince of Wales, Alaska, and requested Newmont USA Limited pay
    those costs and perform an Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis
    (“EE/CA”) to assess what future response activities
    might need to be completed at the site. Newmont intends to
    vigorously defend any formal claims by the EPA. Newmont has
    agreed to perform the EE/CA. Newmont cannot reasonably predict
    the likelihood or outcome of any future action against it
    arising from this matter.

PT Newmont
    Minahasa Raya (“PTNMR”) — 80% Newmont
    Owned

On March 22, 2007, an Indonesian non-governmental
    organization named Wahana Lingkungan Hidup Indonesia
    (“WALHI”) filed a civil suit against PTNMR, the
    Newmont subsidiary that operated the Minahasa mine in Indonesia,
    and Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources
    and Ministry for the Environment, alleging pollution from the
    disposal of mine tailings into Buyat Bay, and seeking a court
    order requiring PTNMR to fund a

25-year

monitoring program in relation to Buyat Bay. In December 2007,
    the court ruled in PTNMR’s favor and found that
    WALHI’s allegations of pollution in Buyat Bay were without
    merit. In March 2008, WALHI appealed this decision to the
    Indonesian High Court. On January 27, 2010, the Indonesian
    High Court upheld the December 2007 ruling in favor of PTNMR. On
    May 17, 2010, WALHI filed an appeal of the January 27,
    2010 Indonesian High Court



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ruling seeking review from the Indonesian Supreme Court. The
    appeal by WALHI is being reviewed by the Indonesian Supreme
    Court. Independent sampling and testing of Buyat Bay water and
    fish, as well as area residents, conducted by the World Health
    Organization and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and
    Industrial Research Organization, confirm that PTNMR has not
    polluted the Buyat Bay environment, and, therefore, has not
    adversely affected the fish in Buyat Bay or the health of nearby
    residents. The Company remains steadfast that it has not caused
    pollution or health problems.

Other Legal
    Matters

Minera Yanacocha
    S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) — 51.35% Newmont
    Owned

Choropampa.

In June 2000, a transport
    contractor of Yanacocha spilled approximately 151 kilograms
    of elemental mercury near the town of Choropampa, Peru, which is
    located 53 miles (85 kilometers) southwest of the Yanacocha
    mine. Elemental mercury is not used in Yanacocha’s
    operations but is a by-product of gold mining and was sold to a
    Lima firm for use in medical instruments and industrial
    applications. A comprehensive health and environmental
    remediation program was undertaken by Yanacocha in response to
    the incident. In August 2000, Yanacocha paid under protest a
    fine of 1,740,000 Peruvian soles (approximately $0.5) to the
    Peruvian government. Yanacocha has entered into settlement
    agreements with a number of individuals impacted by the
    incident. As compensation for the disruption and inconvenience
    caused by the incident, Yanacocha entered into agreements with
    and provided a variety of public works in the three communities
    impacted by this incident. Yanacocha cannot predict the
    likelihood of additional expenditures related to this matter.

Additional lawsuits relating to the Choropampa incident were
    filed against Yanacocha in the local courts of Cajamarca, Peru,
    in May 2002 by over 900 Peruvian citizens. A significant number
    of the plaintiffs in these lawsuits entered into settlement
    agreements with Yanacocha prior to filing such claims. In April
    2008, the Peruvian Supreme Court upheld the validity of these
    settlement agreements, which the Company expects to result in
    the dismissal of all claims brought by previously settled
    plaintiffs. Yanacocha has also entered into settlement
    agreements with approximately 350 additional plaintiffs. The
    claims asserted by approximately 200 plaintiffs remain. Neither
    the Company nor Yanacocha can reasonably estimate the ultimate
    loss relating to such claims.

PT Newmont Nusa
    Tenggara (“PTNNT”) — 31.5% Newmont Direct
    Ownership

Under the Batu Hijau Contract of Work, beginning in 2006 and
    continuing through 2010, a portion of PTNNT’s shares were
    required to be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian
    government or, second, to Indonesian nationals, equal to the
    difference between the following percentages and the percentage
    of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or
    Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 23% by
    March 31, 2006; 30% by March 31, 2007; 37% by
    March 31, 2008; 44% by March 31, 2009; and 51% by
    March 31, 2010. As PT Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an
    Indonesian national, has owned a 20% interest in PTNNT at all
    relevant times, in 2006, a 3% interest was required to be
    offered for sale and, in each of 2007 through 2010, an
    additional 7% interest was required to be offered (for an
    aggregate 31% interest). The price at which such interests were
    to be offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest
    of the then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares
    would be accepted for listing on the Indonesian Stock Exchange,
    or the fair market value of such interest as a going concern, as
    agreed with the Indonesian government.

In accordance with the Contract of Work, an offer to sell a 3%
    interest was made to the Indonesian government in 2006 and an
    offer for an additional 7% interest was made in each of 2007,
    2008 and 2009, and the offer for the final 7% interest was made
    in March 2010. While the central government declined to
    participate in the 2006 and 2007 offers, local governments in
    the area in which the Batu Hijau mine is located expressed
    interest in acquiring shares, as did various Indonesian

nationals. After disagreement with the government over whether
    the government’s first right to purchase had expired and
    receipt of Notices of Default from the government claiming
    breach and threatening termination of the Contract of Work, on
    March 3, 2008, the Indonesian government filed for
    international arbitration as provided under the Contract of
    Work, as did PTNNT. In the arbitration proceeding, PTNNT sought
    a declaration that the Indonesian government was not entitled to
    terminate the Contract of Work and additional declarations
    pertaining to the procedures for divesting the shares. For its
    part, the Indonesian government sought declarations that PTNNT
    was in default of its divestiture obligations, that the
    government may terminate the Contract of Work and recover
    damages for breach of the Contract of Work, and that PTNNT must
    cause shares subject to divestiture to be sold to certain local
    governments.

An international arbitration panel (the “Panel”) was
    appointed to resolve these claims and other claims that had
    arisen in relation to divestment and a hearing was held in
    Jakarta in December 2008. On March 31, 2009, the Panel
    issued its final award and decision on the matter. In its
    decision, the Panel determined that PTNNT’s foreign
    shareholders had not complied with the divestiture procedure
    required by the Contract of Work in 2006 and 2007, but the Panel
    ruled that the Indonesian government was not entitled to
    immediately terminate the Contract of Work and rejected the
    Indonesian government’s claim for damages. The Panel
    granted PTNNT 180 days from the date of notification of the
    final award to effect transfer of the 2006 3% interest and the
    2007 7% interest in PTNNT to the local governments or their
    respective nominees. The Panel also applied a

180-day

cure
    period to the 2008 7% interest, requiring that PTNNT effect the
    offer of the 2008 7% interest to the Indonesian government or
    its nominee within such

180-day

period, and ensure the transfer of such shares if, after
    agreement on the transfer price, the Indonesian government
    invoked its right of first refusal under the Contract of Work.
    On July 14, 2009, the Company reached agreement with the
    Indonesian government on the price of the 2008 7% interest and
    the 2009 7% interest. PTNNT effected the reoffer of the 2008 7%
    interest and the 2009 7% interest to the Indonesian government
    at this newly agreed price. In November and December 2009, sale
    agreements were concluded pursuant to which the 2006, 2007 and
    2008 shares were transferred to PT Multi Daerah Bersaing
    (“PTMDB”), the nominee of the local governments, and
    the 2009 shares were transferred to PTMDB in February 2010,
    resulting in PTMDB owning a 24% interest in PTNNT.

On December 17, 2010, the Ministry of Energy &
    Mineral Resources, acting on behalf of the Indonesian
    government, accepted the offer to acquire the final 7% interest
    in PTNNT. The government entity that will purchase the shares
    has not yet been designated, but the purchase and sale of this
    final 7% stake offered to complete the divestiture process is
    anticipated to close in the first half of 2011. Further disputes
    may arise in regard to the divestiture of the 2010 shares.

As part of the negotiation of the sale agreements with PTMDB,
    the parties executed an operating agreement (the “Operating
    Agreement”) under which each recognizes the rights of the
    Company and Sumitomo to apply their operating standards to the
    management of PTNNT’s operations, including standards for
    safety, environmental stewardship and community responsibility.
    The Operating Agreement became effective upon the completion of
    the sale of the 2009 shares in February 2010 and will
    continue for so long as the Company and Sumitomo own more shares
    of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the Operating Agreement terminates, then
    the Company may lose control over the applicable operating
    standards for Batu Hijau and will be at risk for operations
    conducted in a manner that either detracts from value or results
    in safety, environmental or social standards below those adhered
    to by the Company and Sumitomo.

In the event of any future disputes under the Contract of Work
    or Operating Agreement, there can be no assurance that the
    Company would prevail in any such dispute and any termination of
    such contracts could result in substantial diminution in the
    value of the Company’s interests in PTNNT.

Additionally, in February 2010, PTNNT was notified by the tax
    authorities of the Indonesian government, that PTNNT may be
    obligated to pay value added taxes on certain goods imported
    after the year 2000. PTNNT believes that pursuant to the terms
    of its Contract of Work, it is only required to pay value added
    taxes on these types of goods imported after February 28,
    2010. The Company and PTNNT are working cooperatively with the
    applicable government authorities to resolve this matter.

Effective as of January 1, 2011, the local government in
    the region where the Batu Hijau mine is located purported to
    commence the enforcement of regulations that purport to require
    PTNNT to pay additional taxes based on revenue and the value of
    PTNNT’s contracts. In addition, the regulations purport to
    require PTNNT to obtain certain export-related documents from
    the regional government for purposes of shipping copper
    concentrate. PTNNT is required to and has obtained all export
    related-documents in compliance with the laws and regulations of
    the central government. PTNNT believes that the new regional
    regulations are not enforceable as they expressly contradict
    higher level Indonesian laws that set out the permissible
    taxes that can be imposed by a regional government and all
    effective export requirements. PTNNT’s position is
    supported by Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy &
    Mineral Resources, Ministry of Trade, and the provincial
    government. To date, PTNNT has not been forced to comply with
    these new contradictory regional regulations. On
    February 4, 2011, PTNNT filed legal proceedings seeking to
    have the regulations declared null and void because they
    conflict with the laws of Indonesia. Further disputes with the
    local government could arise in relation to these regulations.
    PTNNT intends to vigorously defend its position in this dispute.

PT Pukuafu Indah
    Litigation

In October 2009, PTPI filed a lawsuit in the Central Jakarta
    District Court against PTNNT and the Indonesian government
    seeking to cancel the March 2009 arbitration award pertaining to
    the manner in which divestiture of shares in PTNNT should
    proceed (refer to the discussion of PTNNT above for the
    arbitration results). On October 11, 2010, the District
    Court ruled in favor of PTNNT and the Indonesian government
    finding, among other things, that PTPI lacks standing to contest
    the validity of the arbitration award. PTPI has filed a notice
    of appeal of the court’s ruling.

Subsequent to its initial claim, PTPI filed numerous additional
    lawsuits, two of which have been withdrawn, against Newmont
    Indonesia Limited (“NIL”) and Nusa Tenggara Mining
    Corporation (“NTMC”), a subsidiary of Sumitomo, in the
    South Jakarta District Court. Fundamentally, the cases all
    relate to PTPI’s contention that it owns, or has rights to
    own, the shares in PTNNT that NIL and NTMC have or will divest
    to fulfill the requirements of the PTNNT Contract of Work and
    the March 2009 arbitration award. PTPI also makes various other
    allegations, including alleged rights in or to the
    Company’s or Sumitomo’s non-divestiture shares in
    PTNNT, and PTPI asserts claims for significant damages allegedly
    arising from NIL’s and NTMC’s unlawful acts in
    transferring the divestiture shares to a third party. On
    November 30, 2010, the South Jakarta District Court
    rendered a decision in favor of PTPI in one of the cases which
    included an order that NIL/NTMC transfer 31% of PTNNT shares to
    PTPI and pay PTPI $26 in damages and certain monetary penalties.
    The order is not final and binding until the appeal process is
    completed. NIL and NTMC appealed the decision. In January 2010,
    PTPI also filed a lawsuit against PTNNT’s President
    Director, Mr. Martiono Hadianto, alleging wrongful acts
    associated with the arbitration, including failure to properly
    share certain information. The South Jakarta District Court
    issued a decision partially in favor of PTPI against the PTNNT
    President Director, requiring the production of arbitration
    documents. The PTNNT President Director has appealed the
    decision which is non binding until the appeal process is
    completed. Despite the rulings, Newmont, Sumitomo and
    PTNNT’s management believe that all of PTPI’s claims
    in these cases are without merit and constitute a material
    breach of a written release agreement executed by PTPI in 2009,
    in which it and its shareholders committed to cease prosecution
    of all then-pending lawsuits and

not to initiate new proceedings, in conjunction with
    Newmont’s provision of financing to PTPI in late 2009.

In August 2010, NIL and NVL USA Limited (“NVL”)
    commenced an arbitration against PTPI in the Singapore
    International Arbitration Centre, as provided in relevant
    agreements, seeking declarations that PTPI has violated the
    release agreement by failing to dismiss its Indonesian lawsuits,
    that PTPI is in breach of the November 2009 loan facility and
    related agreements, and that NIL and NVL are entitled to damages
    arising from PTPI’s and its shareholders’ conduct.

On October 1, 2010, NIL and NVL requested, based upon the
    release agreement, that the arbitral tribunal issue an interim
    order requiring PTPI and its shareholders to discontinue the
    various Indonesian court proceedings and refrain from bringing
    additional lawsuits. On October 15, 2010, the tribunal
    issued an order granting NIL and NVL’s request. The order
    of the tribunal restrains PTPI and its agents from
    “proceeding with or continuing with or assisting or
    participating in the prosecution of the Indonesian [s]uits”
    and from commencing additional proceedings relating to the same
    subject matter as the Indonesian lawsuits. NIL and NVL are in
    the process of enforcing the interim award in Indonesian courts
    but it is not known the extent to which the Indonesian courts
    will enforce the order or whether PTPI and its shareholders
    will, in any event, abide by the order.

The Company intends to continue vigorously defending the PTPI
    lawsuits and pursuing its claims against PTPI in arbitration.

Other Commitments
    and Contingencies

Tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with ASC income
    tax guidance (see Note 10).

In a 1993 asset exchange, a wholly-owned subsidiary transferred
    a coal lease under which the subsidiary had collected advance
    royalty payments totaling $484. From 1994 to 2018, remaining
    advance payments under the lease to the transferee total $390.
    In the event of title failure as stated in the lease, this
    subsidiary has a primary obligation to refund previously
    collected payments and has a secondary obligation to refund any
    of the $390 collected by the transferee, if the transferee fails
    to meet its refund obligation. The subsidiary has title
    insurance on the leased coal deposits of $240 covering the
    secondary obligation. The Company and the subsidiary regard the
    circumstances entitling the lessee to a refund as remote.

The Company has minimum royalty obligations on one of its
    producing mines in Nevada for the life of the mine. Amounts paid
    as a minimum royalty (where production royalties are less than
    the minimum obligation) in any year are recoverable in future
    years when the minimum royalty obligation is exceeded. Although
    the minimum royalty requirement may not be met in a particular
    year, the Company expects that over the mine life, gold
    production will be sufficient to meet the minimum royalty
    requirements. Minimum royalty payments payable are $28 in 2011
    through 2015 and $251 thereafter.

As part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company and
    its affiliates are required to provide surety bonds, bank
    letters of credit and bank guarantees as financial support for
    various purposes, including environmental reclamation,
    exploration permitting, workers compensation programs and other
    general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009, there were $1,191 and $1,073,
    respectively, of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and
    bank guarantees. The surety bonds, letters of credit and bank
    guarantees reflect fair value as a condition of their underlying
    purpose and are subject to fees competitively determined in the
    market place. The obligations associated with these instruments
    are generally related to performance requirements that the
    Company addresses through its ongoing operations. As the
    specific requirements are met, the beneficiary of the associated
    instrument cancels

and/or

returns the instrument to the issuing entity.



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Certain of these instruments are associated with operating sites
    with long-lived assets and will remain outstanding until
    closure. Generally, bonding requirements associated with
    environmental regulation are becoming more restrictive. However,
    the Company, believes it is in compliance with all applicable
    bonding obligations and will be able to satisfy future bonding
    requirements, through existing or alternative means, as they
    arise.

Newmont is from time to time involved in various legal
    proceedings related to its business. Except in the
    above-described proceedings, management does not believe that
    adverse decisions in any pending or threatened proceeding or
    that amounts that may be required to be paid by reason thereof
    will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial condition or results of operations.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

On February 3, 2011, Newmont and Fronteer Gold Inc.
    (“Fronteer”) announced that they had entered into an
    agreement under which Newmont will acquire all of the
    outstanding common shares of Fronteer by way of a Plan of
    Arrangement (“Arrangement”). Fronteer owns, among
    other assets, the exploration stage Long Canyon project, which
    is located approximately one hundred miles from the
    Company’s existing infrastructure in Nevada and provides
    the potential for significant development and operating
    synergies. Under the Arrangement, shareholders of Fronteer will
    receive C$14.00 in cash and one common share in Pilot Gold,
    which will retain certain exploration assets of Fronteer, for
    each common share of Fronteer. The transaction is expected to
    close in the second quarter of 2011 for approximately C$2,300.
    Provided for in the Arrangement is a break fee of C$85 if the
    transaction is not completed in certain specified circumstances.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

During the fiscal period covered by this report, the
    Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company,
    carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”)). Based on such evaluation, the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered
    by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits
    under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the required time periods and are designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports
    is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.

There has been no change in the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter
    that has materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

Management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting and the attestation report on management’s
    assessment are included in Item 8 of this annual report on

Form 10-K.

ITEM 9B.

OTHER
    INFORMATION

Mine Safety
    Disclosure

At Newmont, safety is a core value and we strive for superior
    performance. Our health and safety management system, which
    includes detailed standards and procedures for safe production,
    addresses topics such as employee training, risk management,
    workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation
    and program auditing. In addition to strong leadership and
    involvement from all levels of the organization, these programs
    and procedures form the cornerstone of safety at Newmont,
    ensuring that employees are provided a superior safe and healthy
    environment and are intended as a means to reduce workplace
    accidents, incidents and losses, comply with all mining-related
    regulations and provide support for both regulators and the
    industry to improve mine safety.

In addition, we have an established “Rapid Response”
    process to mitigate and prevent the escalation of adverse
    consequences in the event that existing risk management controls
    fail, particularly in the event of an incident that may have the
    potential to seriously impact the safety of employees, the
    community or the environment. This process provides appropriate
    support to an affected site to complement their technical
    response to an incident, minimizes the impact by considering the
    environmental, strategic, legal, financial and public image
    aspects of the incident, ensures communications are being
    carried out in accordance with legal and ethical requirements
    and identifies actions that need to be taken on a broader scale
    than can be predicted by those involved in overcoming the
    immediate hazards.

The operation of our U.S. based mines is subject to
    regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration
    (“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act
    of 1977 (the “Mine Act”). MSHA inspects our mines on a
    regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it
    believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Following
    passage of The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act
    of 2006, MSHA significantly increased the numbers of citations



and orders charged against mining operations. The dollar
    penalties assessed for citations issued has also increased in
    recent years.

Newmont is required to report certain mine safety violations in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
    Reform and Consumer Protection Act and that required information
    is included in exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by
    reference into this Annual Report.
