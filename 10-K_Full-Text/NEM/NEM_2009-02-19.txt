Introduction

Newmont Mining Corporation is primarily a gold producer with
    significant assets or operations in the United States,
    Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, New Zealand and
    Mexico. At December 31, 2008, Newmont had proven and
    probable gold reserves of 85.0 million equity ounces and an
    aggregate land position of approximately 38,840 square
    miles (100,600 square kilometers). Newmont is also engaged
    in the production of copper, principally through its Batu Hijau
    operation in Indonesia. Newmont Mining Corporation’s
    original predecessor corporation was incorporated in 1921 under
    the laws of Delaware.

Newmont’s corporate headquarters are in Greenwood Village,
    Colorado, USA. In this report, “Newmont,” the
    “Company,” “our” and “we” refer to
    Newmont Mining Corporation

and/or

our
    affiliates and subsidiaries.

On January 27, 2009, we entered into a definitive sale and
    purchase agreement with AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited
    (“AngloGold”) to acquire its 33.33% interest in the
    Boddington project in Western Australia. Upon expected
    completion of the acquisition, we will own 100% of the
    Boddington project. Consideration for the acquisition consists
    of $750 payable in cash at closing, $240 payable in cash

and/or

Newmont common stock, at our option, in December 2009, and a
    royalty capped at $100, equal to 50% of the average realized
    operating margin (Revenue less

Costs applicable to sales

on a by-product basis), if any, exceeding $600 per ounce,
    payable on one-third of gold sales from Boddington. The
    valuation date for the transaction is January 2009 and the
    transaction is expected to close in March 2009, subject to
    satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions and approvals. We
    can make no assurances that the pending acquisition of the
    remaining interest in the Boddington project will be
    consummated. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, Risks Related to
    Newmont Operations, below.

On February 3, 2009, we completed a public offering of $450
    convertible senior notes, maturing on February 15, 2012.
    The notes will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.00% per
    annum. The notes are convertible, at the holder’s option,
    equivalent to a conversion price of $46.25 per share of common
    stock. We granted the underwriters an option to purchase $68 in
    additional convertible senior notes at the public offering
    price, less the underwriting discount, to cover over-allotments,
    if any. The



over-allotment option was exercised in full and delivery of the
    convertible notes was made to purchasers on February 3,
    2009. Additionally, on February 3, 2009, we completed a
    public offering of 30,000,000 shares of common stock at a
    public offering price of $37.00, less an underwriting discount
    of $1.17 per share. We also granted the underwriters an option
    to purchase up to 4,500,000 additional shares of common stock at
    the public offering price, less the underwriting discount, to
    cover over-allotments. The overallotment option was exercised in
    full and delivery of shares was made to purchasers on
    February 3, 2009. Such offerings were made pursuant to our
    shelf registration statement on

Form S-3.

See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Shelf Registration Statement.

For additional information, see Item 7, Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and
    Results of Operations.

Segment
    Information, Export Sales, etc.

We have operating segments of Nevada, Yanacocha in Peru,
    Australia/New Zealand, Batu Hijau in Indonesia, Africa and Other
    Operations comprised of smaller operations in Bolivia and
    Mexico. We also have our Hope Bay segment in Canada, following
    the acquisition of Miramar Mining Corporation, and an
    Exploration Segment. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, Risks
    Related to Newmont Operations, below and Note 31 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to
    our business segments, our domestic and export sales, and our
    non-dependence on a limited number of customers.

Products

Gold

General.

We had consolidated sales of
    6.3 million ounces of gold (5.2 million equity ounces)
    in 2008, 6.2 million ounces (5.3 million equity
    ounces) in 2007 and 7.2 million ounces (5.9 million
    equity ounces) in 2006. For 2008, 2007 and 2006, 88%, 78% and
    86%, respectively, of our net revenues were attributable to gold
    sales. Of our 2008 gold sales, approximately 35% came from
    Nevada, 30% from Yanacocha, 19% from Australia/New Zealand, 5%
    from Batu Hijau and 8% from Africa. References in this report to
    “equity ounces” or “equity pounds” mean that
    portion of gold or copper produced, sold or included in proven
    and probable reserves that is attributable to our ownership or
    economic interest.

Most of our revenue comes from the sale of refined gold in the
    international market. The end product at our gold operations,
    however, is generally doré bars. Doré is an alloy
    consisting mostly of gold but also containing silver, copper and
    other metals. Doré is sent to refiners to produce bullion
    that meets the required market standard of 99.95% pure gold.
    Under the terms of our refining agreements, the doré bars
    are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and the
    separately-recovered silver and copper are credited to our
    account or delivered to buyers. Gold sold from Batu Hijau and a
    portion of the gold from Phoenix, in Nevada, is contained in a
    saleable concentrate.

Gold Uses.

Gold has two main categories of
    use: fabrication and investment. Fabricated gold has a variety
    of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry,
    industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official
    coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins and
    jewelry.

Gold Supply.

The supply of gold consists of a
    combination of current production from mining and the draw-down
    of existing stocks of gold held by governments, financial
    institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals.
    Based on public information available for the years 2006 through
    2008, current mine production has, on average accounted for
    approximately 71% of the annual supply of gold.



Gold Price.

The following table presents the
    annual high, low and average daily afternoon fixing prices for
    gold over the past ten years, expressed in U.S. dollars per
    ounce, on the London Bullion Market.

On February 11, 2009, the afternoon fixing price for gold
    on the London Bullion Market was $938 per ounce and the spot
    market price of gold on the New York Commodity Exchange was $940
    per ounce.

We generally sell our gold at the prevailing market price during
    the month in which the gold is delivered to the customer. We
    recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable,
    the gold has been delivered, the title has been transferred to
    the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably
    assured.

Copper

General.

We had consolidated sales of
    290 million pounds of copper (130 million equity
    pounds) in 2008, 428 million pounds (204 million
    equity pounds) in 2007 and 435 million pounds
    (230 million equity pounds) in 2006. For 2008, 2007 and
    2006, 12%, 22% and 14%, respectively, of our net revenues were
    attributable to copper. As of December 31, 2008, we had a
    45% ownership interest in the Batu Hijau operation in Indonesia,
    which began production in 1999. Production at Batu Hijau is in
    the form of a copper/gold concentrate that is sold to smelters
    for further treatment and refining.

Copper Uses.

Refined copper is incorporated
    into wire and cable products for use in the construction,
    electric utility, communications and transportation industries.
    Copper is also used in industrial equipment and machinery,
    consumer products and a variety of other electrical and
    electronic applications, and is also used to make brass. Copper
    substitutes include aluminum, plastics, stainless steel and
    fiber optics. Refined, or cathode, copper is also an
    internationally traded commodity.

Copper Supply.

The supply of copper consists
    of a combination of current production from mining and recycled
    scrap material.



Copper Price.

The price of copper is quoted on
    the London Metal Exchange in terms of dollars per metric ton of
    high grade copper. The following table presents the dollar per
    pound equivalent of the annual high, low and average daily
    prices of high grade copper on the London Metal Exchange over

On February 11, 2009, the closing price of high grade
    copper was $1.53 per pound on the London Metal Exchange. Our
    historic ability to sell copper at market prices was limited in
    some cases by hedging activities, more particularly described in
    Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
    Market Risk, and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Hedging
    Activities

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes
    in the gold price by selling our gold production at market
    prices. Prior to 2007, however, we entered into derivative
    contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated
    gold and copper production. During 2007, we delivered into the
    last of the copper collar contracts and net settled all
    price-capped forward gold sales contracts. We continue to manage
    risks associated with commodity inputs, interest rates and
    foreign currencies using the derivative market.

For additional information, see Hedging in Item 7A,
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and
    Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Exploration

Our exploration group is responsible for our global efforts to
    discover new mineralized material and convert it into proven and
    probable reserves. We conduct near-mine exploration around our
    existing mines and greenfields exploration in other prospective
    regions globally. Near-mine exploration can result in the
    discovery of additional deposits, which will receive the
    economic benefit of existing operating, processing, and
    administrative infrastructures; whereas the discovery of new
    mineralization through greenfields exploration efforts will
    likely require capital investment to build a separate,
    stand-alone operation. Our exploration group employs
    state-of-the-art technology, including airborne geophysical data
    acquisition systems, satellite location devices and
    field-portable imaging systems, as well as geochemical and
    geological prospecting methods, to identify prospective
    mineralization targets. We expensed $214 in 2008, $177 in 2007
    and $166 in 2006 on

Exploration

.

As of December 31, 2008, we had proven and probable gold
    reserves of 85.0 million equity ounces. We added
    5.2 million equity ounces to proven and probable reserves,
    and depleted 6.7 million equity ounces during 2008. 2008
    reserves were calculated at a $725, A$850 or NZ$1,000 per ounce



gold price. A reconciliation of the changes in proven and
    probable reserves during the past three years is as follows:

In Nevada, proven and probable gold reserves decreased to
    28.1 million equity ounces after additions of
    1.8 million equity ounces and depletion of 3.1 million
    equity ounces.

At Yanacocha in Peru, proven and probable gold reserves
    decreased after downward revisions of 0.1 million equity
    ounces and depletion of 1.2 million equity ounces. As of
    December 31, 2008, we reported reserves of 6.7 million
    equity ounces at Yanacocha and 6.1 million equity ounces at
    Conga.

In Australia/New Zealand, proven and probable gold reserves
    increased to 20.9 million equity ounces after additions of
    2.8 million equity ounces and depletion of 1.3 million
    equity ounces, primarily from Boddington (66.67%) and Jundee.

At Batu Hijau in Indonesia, proven and probable reserves
    decreased to 3,950 million equity pounds of copper and
    4.1 million equity ounces of gold after depletion of
    170 million equity pounds of copper and 0.2 million
    equity ounces of gold.

At Ahafo in Ghana, proven and probable gold reserves decreased
    by 0.3 million equity ounces as a result of
    0.2 million equity ounces of additions offset by depletion
    of 0.5 million equity ounces. As of December 31, 2008,
    we reported reserves of 9.3 million equity ounces at Ahafo
    and 7.7 million equity ounces at Akyem.

For additional information, see Item 2, Properties, Proven
    and Probable Reserves.

Licenses and
    Concessions

Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing
    facilities, there are no third party patents, licenses or
    franchises material to our business. In many countries, however,
    we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to
    concessions granted by, or under contract with, the host
    government. These countries include, among others, Australia,
    Bolivia, Canada, Ghana, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand and Peru.
    The concessions and contracts are subject to the political risks
    associated with foreign operations. See Item 1A, Risk
    Factors, Risks Related to Newmont, below. For a more detailed
    description of our Indonesian Contract of Work, see Item 2,
    Properties, below.



Condition of
    Physical Assets and Insurance

Our business is capital intensive, requiring ongoing capital
    investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of
    equipment and facilities. For more information, see Item 7,
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and
    Capital Resources, below.

We maintain insurance policies against property loss and
    business interruption and insure against risks that are typical
    in the operation of our business, in amounts that we believe to
    be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and
    limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to
    environmental liability and political risk. There can be no
    assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance
    policies in connection with a particular event. See
    Item 1A, Risk Factors, Risks Related to Newmont, below.

Environmental
    Matters

Our United States mining and exploration activities are subject
    to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the
    protection of the environment, including the Clean Air Act; the
    Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and
    Community Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; the
    Federal Land Policy and Management Act; the National
    Environmental Policy Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery
    Act; and related state laws. These laws and regulations are
    continually changing and are generally becoming more
    restrictive. Our activities outside the United States are also
    subject to governmental regulations for the protection of the
    environment.

We conduct our operations so as to protect public health and the
    environment and believe our operations are in compliance with
    applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Each
    operating mine has a reclamation plan in place that meets all
    applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have made, and
    expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such
    laws and regulations. We have made estimates of the amount of
    such expenditures, but cannot precisely predict the amount of
    such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are
    based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. As of
    December 31, 2008, $617 was accrued for reclamation costs
    relating to currently developed and producing properties.

We are also involved in several matters concerning environmental
    obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining
    activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and
    implementing remediation plans at the various sites. We believe
    that the related environmental obligations associated with these
    sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of
    remediation plans, their risk profile and the activities
    required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon our
    best estimate of our liability for these matters, $163 was
    accrued as of December 31, 2008 for such obligations
    associated with properties previously owned or operated by us or
    our subsidiaries. These amounts are included in

Other current
    liabilities

and

Reclamation and remediation liabilities.

Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, we
    believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability for
    these matters could be as much as 126% greater or 7% lower than
    the amount accrued as of December 31, 2008. The amounts
    accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon
    facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in
    estimates are charged to costs and expenses in the period when
    estimates are revised.

For a discussion of the most significant reclamation and
    remediation activities, see Item 7, Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and
    Results of Operations, and Notes 25 and 33 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, below.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per
    pound amounts)

Every investor or potential investor in Newmont should carefully
    consider the following risks, which have been separated into two
    groups:

•

Risks related to the mining industry generally; and

•

Risks related to Newmont.

Risks Related to
    the Mining Industry Generally

A Substantial
    or Extended Decline in Gold or Copper Prices Would Have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Newmont

Our business is dependent on the realized price of gold and
    copper, which are affected by numerous factors beyond our
    control. Factors tending to put downward pressure on prices
    include:

•

Sales or leasing of gold by governments and central banks;

•

U.S. dollar strength;

•

Recession or reduced economic activity;

•

Speculative selling;

•

Decreased industrial, jewelry or investment demand;

•

Increased supply from production, disinvestment and scrap;

•

Sales by producers in forward and other hedging
    transactions; and

•

Devaluing local currencies (relative to gold and copper priced
    in U.S. dollars) leading to lower production costs and
    higher production in certain regions.

Any drop in the realized price of gold or copper adversely
    impacts our revenues, net income and cash flows, particularly in
    light of our strategy of not hedging revenues. We have recorded
    asset write-downs in the past and may experience additional
    impairments as a result of low gold or copper prices in the
    future.



In addition, sustained low gold or copper prices can:

•

Reduce revenues further through production declines due to
    cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits,
    that have become uneconomic at the then-prevailing gold or
    copper price;

•

Reduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore
    stockpiles and ore on leach pads;

•

Halt or delay the development of new projects;

•

Reduce funds available for exploration; and

•

Reduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can
    no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices.

Also see the discussion in Item 1, Business, Gold or Copper
    Price.

Gold and
    Copper Producers Must Continually Replace Reserves Depleted By
    Production

Gold and copper producers must continually replace reserves
    depleted by production. Depleted reserves must be replaced by
    expanding known ore bodies or by locating new deposits in order
    to maintain production levels over the long term. Exploration is
    highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and frequently
    is unproductive. Our new or ongoing exploration programs may not
    result in new mineral producing operations. In addition, for the
    year 2009, we anticipate that the global exploration budget will
    be reduced significantly, which may adversely affect the timing
    and extent of new mineral discoveries and the replacement of
    reserves. Once mineralization is discovered, it will likely take
    many years from the initial phases of exploration until
    production, during which time the economic feasibility of
    production may change.

Estimates of
    Proven and Probable Reserves Are Uncertain

Estimates of proven and probable reserves are subject to
    considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, to a large extent,
    based on the price of gold and interpretations of geologic data
    obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques.
    Producers use feasibility studies to derive estimates of capital
    and operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of
    ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of
    the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore,
    the costs of comparable facilities, the costs of operating and
    processing equipment and other factors. Actual operating costs
    and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from
    original estimates. Further, it may take many years from the
    initial phase of exploration before production and, during that
    time, the economic feasibility of exploiting a discovery may
    change.

Increased
    Costs Could Affect Profitability

Costs at any particular mining location frequently are subject
    to variation due to a number of factors, such as changing ore
    grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in
    response to the physical shape and location of the ore body. In
    addition, costs are affected by the price of input commodities,
    such as fuel, electricity and labor. Commodity costs are at
    times subject to volatile price movements, including increases
    that could make production at certain operations less
    profitable. Reported costs may also be affected by changes in
    accounting standards. A material increase in costs at any
    significant location could have a significant effect on our
    profitability and cash flow. In 2008 and 2007, we incurred
    significant increases in the costs of labor, fuel, power and
    other bulk consumables, which increased reported

Costs
    applicable to sales

, in addition to increasing the costs of
    capital projects.

We anticipate significant capital expenditures over the next
    several years in connection with the development of new projects
    and sustaining existing operations. Costs associated with
    capital expenditures have escalated on an industry-wide basis
    over the last several years, as a result of



major factors beyond our control, including the prices of oil,
    steel and other commodities and labor. Increased costs for
    capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the
    profitability of existing mining operations and economic returns
    anticipated from new mining projects.

Shortages of
    Critical Parts, Equipment and Skilled Labor May Adversely Affect
    Our Operations and Development Projects

The industry has been impacted by increased demand for critical
    resources such as input commodities, drilling equipment, tires
    and skilled labor. These shortages have caused unanticipated
    cost increases and delays in delivery times, thereby impacting
    operating costs, capital expenditures and production schedules.

Mining
    Accidents or Other Adverse Events or Conditions at a Mining
    Location Could Reduce Our Production Levels

At any of our operations, production may fall below historic or
    expected levels as a result of mining accidents such as a pit
    wall failure in an open pit mine, cave-ins or flooding at
    underground mines. In addition, production may be unexpectedly
    reduced at a location if, during the course of mining,
    unfavorable ground conditions or seismic activity, extreme or
    prolonged storm events, or prolonged adverse climate changes are
    encountered; ore grades are lower than expected; the physical or
    metallurgical characteristics of the ore are less amenable to
    mining or treatment than expected; or our equipment, processes
    or facilities fail to operate properly or as expected.

Mining
    Companies Are Subject to Extensive Environmental Laws and
    Regulations

Our exploration, mining and processing operations are regulated
    in all countries in which we operate under various federal,
    state, provincial and local laws relating to the protection of
    the environment, which generally include air and water quality,
    hazardous waste management and reclamation. Delays in obtaining,
    or failure to obtain, government permits and approvals may
    adversely impact our operations. The regulatory environment in
    which we operate could change in ways that would substantially
    increase costs to achieve compliance, or otherwise could have a
    material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.
    For a more detailed discussion of potential environmental
    liabilities, see the discussion in Environmental Matters,
    Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Risks Related to
    Newmont

Our Operations
    Outside North America and Australia/New Zealand Are Subject to
    Risks of Doing Business Abroad

Exploration, development, production and closure activities
    outside of North America and Australia/New Zealand are
    potentially subject to heightened political and economic risks,
    including:

•

Cancellation or renegotiation of contracts;

•

Disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that
    are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the
    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;

•

Changes in foreign laws or regulations;

•

Royalty and tax increases or claims by governmental entities,
    including retroactive claims;

•

Expropriation or nationalization of property;

•

Currency fluctuations (particularly in countries with high
    inflation);

•

Foreign exchange controls;



•

Restrictions on the ability of local operating companies to sell
    gold offshore for U.S. dollars, or on the ability of such
    companies to hold U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies
    in offshore bank accounts;

•

Import and export regulations, including restrictions on the
    export of gold;

•

Restrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore;

•

Risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla
    activities, insurrection and terrorism;

•

Risk of loss due to disease and other potential endemic health
    issues; and

•

Other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in
    which our operations are conducted, including risks inherent in
    contracts with government owned entities.

Consequently, our exploration, development and production
    activities outside of North America and Australia/New Zealand
    may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control,
    some of which could materially adversely affect our financial
    position or results of operations. Furthermore, if a dispute
    arises from such activities, we may be subject to the exclusive
    jurisdiction of courts outside North America or Australia/New
    Zealand, which could adversely affect the outcome of a dispute.

Our Batu Hijau
    Operation in Indonesia is Subject to Political and Economic
    Risks

We have a substantial investment in Indonesia, a nation that
    since 1997 has undergone financial crises and devaluation of its
    currency, outbreaks of political and religious violence, changes
    in national leadership, and the secession of East Timor, one of
    its former provinces. These factors heighten the risk of abrupt
    changes in the national policy toward foreign investors, which
    in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions
    or contracts, increased taxation, denial of permits or permit
    renewals or expropriation of assets. Subsequent to the
    commencement of operations, the government purported to
    designate the land surrounding the Batu Hijau operation as a
    “protection” forest, which has made operating permits
    more difficult to obtain. In 2009, presidential and
    parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place, the results
    of which may affect the position of the Indonesian government
    relating to mining in general or relative to our assets and
    operations.

Recent violence committed by radical elements in Indonesia and
    other countries, and the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq
    and Afghanistan, may increase the risk that operations owned by
    U.S. companies will be the target of violence. If our Batu
    Hijau operation was so targeted it could have an adverse effect
    on our business.

Our Batu Hijau
    Operation in Indonesia May be Adversely Affected by a Delay in
    Receiving Certain Permits

For over three years, we have been in discussions with the
    Indonesian government to renew a forest use permit (called a
    “Pinjam Pakai”) related to Batu Hijau. In 2005,
    Indonesian governmental authorities reviewed the contractual
    requirements for extension of the Pinjam Pakai and determined
    that P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara, the subsidiary that owns
    Batu Hijau (“PTNNT”) met those requirements. This
    permit is a key requirement to continue to operate Batu Hijau
    efficiently, in addition to the ultimate life of the mine and
    recoverability of reserves. However, the permit extension has
    not been received as of the date of this Annual Report. The
    resulting delay has adversely impacted the Batu Hijau mine plan,
    and may adversely impact future operating and financial results,
    including deferment or cancellation of future development and
    operations.

Our Interest
    in PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”) in Indonesia May
    be Reduced or Terminated under the Contract of
    Work

We operate Batu Hijau, a producer of copper/gold concentrates,
    and currently have a 45% ownership interest in the Batu Hijau
    mine, held through the Nusa Tenggara Partnership
    (“NTP”) with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of
    Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTP and the Sumitomo



affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTP in turn owns 80% of
    PTNNT, the Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. The
    remaining 20% interest in PTNNT is owned by P.T. Pukuafu
    Indah (“PTPI”), an unrelated Indonesian company.

Under the Contract of Work executed between the Indonesian
    government and PTNNT, beginning in 2006 and continuing through
    2010, a portion of PTNNT’s shares must be offered for sale,
    first, to the Indonesian government or, second, to Indonesian
    nationals, such portion equal to the difference between the
    following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned
    by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such
    number is positive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by
    March 31, 2007; 37% by March 31, 2008; 44% by
    March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. The price
    at which such interest must be offered for sale to the
    Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current
    replacement cost, the price at which shares would be accepted
    for listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or the fair market
    value of such interest as a going concern, as agreed with the
    Indonesian government. Pursuant to this provision, it is
    possible that the ownership interest of the Newmont-Sumitomo
    partnership in PTNNT could be reduced to 49%, thus reducing our
    ability to control the operation at Batu Hijau.

PTPI has owned and continues to own a 20% interest in PTNNT, and
    therefore NTP was required to offer a 3% interest in the shares
    of PTNNT for sale in 2006 and an additional 7% interest in each
    of 2007 and 2008. A further 7% interest in the shares of PTNNT
    will be offered for sale in March 2009. In accordance with the
    Contract of Work, an offer to sell a 3% interest was made to the
    government of Indonesia in 2006 and an offer for an additional
    7% interest was made in each of 2007 and 2008. While the central
    government declined to participate in the offer, local
    governments in the area in which Batu Hijau is located have
    expressed interest in acquiring shares, as have various
    Indonesian nationals. In January 2008, NTP agreed to sell, under
    a carried interest arrangement, 2% of PTNNT’s shares to
    Kabupaten Sumbawa, one of the local governments, subject to
    satisfaction of closing conditions. On February 11, 2008,
    PTNNT received a notification from the Department of Energy and
    Mineral Resources (the “DEMR”) alleging that PTNNT was
    in breach of its divestiture requirements under the Contract of
    Work and threatening to issue a notice to terminate the Contract
    of Work if PTNNT did not agree to divest, by February 22,
    2008, the 2006 and 2007 shares, in accordance with the
    direction of the DEMR. A second Notice of Default was received
    relating to the alleged failure to divest the 2008 shares.
    Newmont and Sumitomo believe there is no basis under the
    Contract of Work for these notifications and no grounds for
    terminating the Contract of Work. In March 2008, both the DEMR
    and PTNNT filed for international arbitration as provided under
    the Contract for Work and an arbitration hearing was held in
    Jakarta in December 2008. We anticipate a ruling will be issued
    in the first half of 2009. If the Contract of Work were to be
    terminated pursuant to the pending ruling, PTNNT’s rights
    to conduct mining may be curtailed or terminated.

Our Operations
    in Peru are Subject to Political Risks

During the last several years, Yanacocha, in which we own a
    51.35% interest, has been the target of numerous local political
    protests, including ones that blocked the road between the
    Yanacocha mine complex and the City of Cajamarca in Peru. In
    2004, local opposition to the Cerro Quilish project (which is
    located adjacent to Yanacocha) became so pronounced that
    Yanacocha decided to relinquish its drilling permit for Cerro
    Quilish and the deposit was reclassified from proven and
    probable reserves to non-reserve mineralization. In 2006 a road
    blockade was carried out by members of the Combayo community.
    This blockade was unrelated to Cerro Quilish and resulted in a
    brief cessation of mining activities. We cannot predict whether
    similar or more significant incidents will occur and the
    recurrence of significant community opposition or protests could
    adversely affect Yanacocha’s assets and operations. In
    2007, 2008 and thus far in 2009, no material roadblocks or
    protests occurred involving Yanacocha.

Presidential, congressional and regional elections took place in
    Peru in 2006, with the new national government taking office in
    July 2006. In December 2006, Yanacocha, along with other mining
    companies in Peru, entered into an agreement with the central
    government to contribute



3.75% of net profits to fund social development projects.
    Although the current government has generally taken positions
    promoting private investment, we cannot predict future
    government positions on foreign investment, mining concessions,
    land tenure, environmental regulation or taxation. A change in
    government positions on these issues could adversely affect
    Yanacocha’s assets and operations.

Our Success
    Depends on Our Social and Environmental
    Performance

Our ability to operate successfully in communities around the
    world will likely depend on our ability to develop, operate and
    close mines in a manner that is consistent with the health and
    safety of our employees, the protection of the environment, and
    the creation of long-term economic and social opportunities in
    the communities in which we operate. We have implemented a
    management system designed to promote continuous improvement in
    health and safety, environmental performance and community
    relations. However, our ability to operate could be adversely
    impacted by accidents or events detrimental (or perceived to be
    detrimental) to the health and safety of our employees, the
    environment or the communities in which we operate.

Remediation
    Costs for Environmental Liabilities May Exceed the Provisions We
    Have Made

We have conducted extensive remediation work at two inactive
    sites in the United States. We are conducting mill remediation
    activities at a third site in the United States, an inactive
    uranium mine and mill formerly operated by a subsidiary of
    Newmont, but remediation at the mine is subject to dispute. In
    late 2008, the EPA issued an order regarding water management at
    the mine. Remediation work at the mine site has not yet
    commenced. The environmental standards that may ultimately be
    imposed at this site remain uncertain and a risk exists that the
    costs of remediation may exceed the financial accruals that have
    been made for such remediation by a material amount. For a more
    detailed discussion of potential environmental liabilities, see
    the discussion in Environmental Matters, Note 33 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes
    known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased,
    the amount of that liability and additional cost will be
    recorded at that time and could materially reduce net income in
    that period.

Currency
    Fluctuations May Affect Costs

Currency fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur at our
    operations. Gold is sold throughout the world based principally
    on the U.S. dollar price, but a portion of our operating
    expenses are incurred in local currencies. The appreciation of

non-U.S. dollar

currencies against the U.S. dollar increases the costs of
    gold production in U.S. dollar terms at mines located
    outside the United States.

The foreign currency that primarily impacts our results of
    operations is the Australian dollar. We estimate that every
    $0.10 increase in U.S. dollar / Australian dollar
    exchange rate increases annually the U.S. dollar

Costs
    applicable to sales

by approximately $35 or $40 for each
    ounce of gold produced from operations in Australia before
    taking into account the impact of currency hedging. During 2008,
    the Australian dollar depreciated by approximately $0.19 per
    U.S. dollar, or approximately 22%. In mid-2007, we
    implemented derivative programs to hedge up to 75% of our future
    forecasted Australian dollar denominated operating and capital
    expenditures to reduce the variability in our Australian dollar
    denominated expenditures. As of December 31, 2008, we have
    hedged 66%, 38% and 12% of our forecasted Australian denominated
    operating costs in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. We have
    also hedged 83% of our 66.67% ownership forecasted Australian
    denominated capital expenditures at Boddington in 2009. Our
    Australian dollar derivative programs will limit the benefit to
    the Company of future decreases if any, in the US
    dollar/Australian dollar exchange rates. For additional
    information, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations, Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency
    Exchange Rates, below. For a



more detailed description of how currency exchange rates may
    affect costs, see discussion in Foreign Currency in
    Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions About
    Market Risk.

Future Funding
    Requirements May Affect Our Business

The construction of the Boddington project in Australia, as well
    as potential future investments including the Akyem project in
    Ghana, the Conga project in Peru, the Hope Bay project in
    Nunavut, Canada, and various exploration projects will require
    significant funding. Our operating cash flow may become
    insufficient to meet all of these expenditures, depending on the
    timing and costs of development of these and other projects. As
    a result, new sources of capital may be needed to meet the
    funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing
    business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and
    service significant new sources of capital will be a function of
    macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices, our
    operational performance and our current cash flow and debt
    position, among other factors. Given the limited global
    availability of credit for use in connection with capital
    projects, and given our existing debt position, we may determine
    that in order to retain our investment grade rating, we may need
    to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects
    or sell assets. In the event of lower gold and copper prices,
    unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding
    limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities,
    invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business
    activities, retire or service all outstanding debt and pay
    dividends could be significantly constrained.

Any Downgrade
    in the Credit Ratings Assigned to our Debt Securities could
    Increase our Future Borrowing Costs and Adversely Affect the
    Availability of New Financing

Currently, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services
    rates Newmont Mining Corporation BBB+, with negative outlook,
    and Moody’s Investors Service rates Newmont Mining
    Corporation Baa2, with stable outlook. There can be no assurance
    that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of
    time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating
    agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the
    basis of the rating, so warrant. If we are unable to maintain
    our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable
    to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects
    deteriorate, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating
    agencies, which could adversely affect the value of our
    outstanding securities, our existing debt and the availability
    of other new financing on favorable terms, if at all, increase
    our borrowing costs and impair our results of operations and
    financial condition. See also “Future Funding Requirements
    may Affect our Business” and “Current Global Financial
    Conditions could Adversely Affect the Availability of New
    Financing and our Operations.”

Current Global
    Financial Conditions could Adversely Affect the Availability of
    New Financing and our Operations

Current global financial conditions have been characterized by
    increased market volatility. Several financial institutions have
    either gone into bankruptcy or have had to be re-capitalized by
    governmental authorities. Access to financing has been
    negatively impacted by both the rapid decline in value of
    sub-prime mortgages and the liquidity crisis affecting the
    asset-backed commercial paper market. These factors may
    adversely affect our ability to obtain equity or debt financing
    in the future on terms favorable to us. Additionally, these
    factors, as well as other related factors, may cause decreases
    in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary,
    which may result in impairment losses. If such increased levels
    of volatility and market turmoil continue, our operations could
    be adversely impacted.



Cost Estimates
    and Timing of New Projects Are Uncertain

The capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines
    or other projects are considerable and changes in costs,
    construction schedules, or both, can affect project economics.
    There are a number of factors that can affect costs and
    construction schedules, including, among others:

•

Availability of labor, power, transportation, commodities and
    infrastructure;

•

Changes in input commodity prices and labor costs;

•

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

Availability and terms of financing;

•

Difficulty of estimating construction costs over a period of
    years;

•

Delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits;

•

Weather and severe climate impacts; and

•

Potential delays related to social and community issues.

Our Operations
    May Be Adversely Affected By Power Shortages

We have periodically experienced power shortages in Ghana
    resulting primarily from a nationwide drought, increasing
    demands for electricity, and insufficient hydroelectric or other
    generating capacity which caused curtailment of production at
    our Ahafo operations. As a result of the mining industry’s
    initiative to construct and install an 80 mega-watt power plant
    during 2007, the Ghanaian government has agreed, if required, to
    curtail power consumption as a result of power shortages, to
    distribute power proportionately between participating mines and
    other industrial and commercial users. Alternative sources of
    power may result in higher than anticipated costs, which will
    affect operating costs. Continued power shortages and increased
    costs may adversely affect our results of operations and
    financial condition.

Occurrence of
    Events for Which We Are Not Insured May Affect Our Cash Flow and
    Overall Profitability

We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against certain
    risks related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in
    amounts that we believe are reasonable depending upon the
    circumstances surrounding each identified risk. However, we may
    elect not to have insurance for certain risks because of the
    high premiums associated with insuring those risks or for
    various other reasons; in other cases, insurance may not be
    available for certain risks. Some concern always exists with
    respect to investments in parts of the world where civil unrest,
    war, nationalist movements, political violence or economic
    crises are possible. These countries may also pose heightened
    risks of expropriation of assets, business interruption,
    increased taxation or unilateral modification of concessions and
    contracts. We do not maintain insurance policies against
    political risk. Occurrence of events for which we are not
    insured may affect our cash flow and overall profitability.

Our Business
    Depends on Good Relations with Our Employees

Due to union activities or other employee actions, we could
    experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions
    in production that could adversely affect us. As of
    December 31, 2008, union represented employees constituted
    approximately 44% of our worldwide work force. Currently, there
    are labor agreements in effect for all of these workers. We may
    be unable to resolve any future disputes without disruption to
    operations.



Title to Some
    of Our Properties May Be Defective or Challenged

Although we have conducted title reviews of our properties,
    title review does not necessarily preclude third parties from
    challenging our title or related property rights. While we
    believe that we have satisfactory title to our properties, some
    risk exists that some titles may be defective or subject to
    challenge. In addition, certain of our Australian properties
    could be subject to native title or traditional landowner
    claims, but such claims would not deprive us of the properties.
    For information regarding native title or traditional landowner
    claims, see the discussion under the Australia/New Zealand
    section of Item 2, Properties, below.

Competition
    from Other Mining Companies May Harm our Business

We compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key
    executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We
    compete with other mining companies for the services of skilled
    personnel and contractors and for specialized equipment,
    components and supplies, such as drill rigs, necessary for
    exploration and development. We also compete with other mining
    companies for rights to mine properties containing gold and
    other minerals. We may be unable to continue to attract and
    retain skilled and experienced employees, to obtain the services
    of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or
    supplies, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties.

Certain
    Factors Outside of Our Control May Affect Our Ability to Support
    the Carrying Value of Goodwill

As of December 31, 2008, the carrying value of goodwill was
    approximately $188 or 1% of our total assets. Goodwill was
    assigned to various mine site reporting units in the
    Australia/New Zealand Segment in connection with our February
    2002 acquisition of Normandy and represents the excess of the
    aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable
    net assets acquired. We evaluate, on at least an annual basis,
    the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether current
    events and circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may
    no longer be recoverable. This evaluation involves a comparison
    of the estimated fair value of our reporting units to their
    carrying values. If the carrying amount of goodwill for any
    reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a non-cash
    impairment charge could result. Material risks that could
    potentially result in an impairment of goodwill include:
    (i) a significant decrease in our long-term gold price
    assumption; (ii) a decrease in reserves; (iii) a lack
    of exploration success which could result in a significant
    reduction in the estimated fair value of mine site exploration
    potential; and (iv) any event that might otherwise
    adversely affect mine site production levels, operating costs or
    capital costs. For a more detailed description of the estimates
    and assumptions involved in assessing the recoverability of the
    carrying value of goodwill, see Item 7, Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and
    Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Policies, below.

Our Ability to
    Recognize the Benefits of Deferred Tax Assets is Dependent on
    Future Cash Flows and Taxable Income

We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax
    assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than
    not of being realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is
    applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the
    recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to
    make significant estimates related to expectations of future
    taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on
    forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of
    existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that
    future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from
    estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could
    be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could
    limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented
    by our deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2008, the
    Company’s current and long-term deferred tax assets were
    $286 and $1,145, respectively.



Returns for
    Investments in Pension Plans Are Uncertain

We maintain pension plans for certain employees which provide
    for specified payments after retirement. The ability of the
    pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our
    funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the
    plans. Returns, if any, on investments are subject to
    fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions.
    A sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could
    require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than
    anticipated. During the second half of 2008, the value of the
    investments in our pension plans decreased significantly. While
    the plans have sufficient assets to meet benefit payments in the
    near term, the plans are underfunded for purposes of long-term
    sustainable payout to all employees. If the plan investment
    values do not recover sufficiently, we may be required to
    increase the amount of future cash contributions. For a more
    detailed discussion of the funding status and expected benefit
    payments to plan participants, see the discussion in
    Employee-Related Benefits, Note 22 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

The
    Acquisition of the Boddington Project is subject to the Receipt
    of Approvals from Regulatory Authorities, which may Impose
    Conditions that could Delay or Prevent the Completion of the
    Acquisition

We can make no assurances that the pending acquisition of the
    remaining interest in the Boddington project will be completed.
    The completion of the acquisition is subject to satisfaction or
    waiver of certain conditions, including the receipt of approvals
    from the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board, Western
    Australia Ministry of Mines and South African Reserve Bank and
    the receipt of consents and agreements from third parties. These
    regulators may impose conditions on the completion, or require
    changes to the terms, of the acquisition. Any such conditions or
    changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing the
    closing of the acquisition or imposing additional costs on us or
    limiting our revenues following the acquisition.



ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES
    (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per pound
    amounts)

Gold and Copper
    Processing Methods

Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either heap
    leaching or milling, depending on the amount of gold contained
    in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related
    capital and operating costs. Higher grade oxide ores are
    generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into
    a fine powder and mixed with water in slurry, which then passes
    through a

carbon-in-leach

circuit. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using
    heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or
    run-of-mine ore on impermeable pads, where a weak cyanide
    solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the
    gold. In both cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected
    and pumped to process facilities to remove the gold by
    collection on carbon or by zinc precipitation.

Gold contained in ores that are not naturally oxidized can be
    directly milled if the gold is amenable to cyanidation,
    generally known as free milling sulfide ores. Ores that are not
    amenable to cyanidation, known as refractory ores, require more
    costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free
    milling ore. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through
    either roasters or autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore
    to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the
    sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use
    heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores.

Some sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant or
    by bio-milling. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into
    slurry, then placed in a tank known as a flotation cell.
    Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing
    sulfides to float attached to air bubbles to the top of the
    tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into
    a concentrate that can then be processed in an autoclave or
    roaster to recover the gold. Bio-milling incorporates patented
    technology that involves inoculation of suitable crushed ore on
    a leach pad with naturally occurring bacteria strains, which
    oxidize the sulfides over a period of time. The ore is then
    processed through an oxide mill.

At Batu Hijau, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a
    coarse size at the mine and then transported from the mine via
    conveyor to a concentrator, where it is finely ground and then
    treated by successive stages of flotation, resulting in a
    concentrate containing approximately 30% copper. The concentrate
    is dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for transport to
    smelters.



Production
    Properties

Set forth below is a description of Newmont’s significant
    production properties. Operating statistics for each operation
    are presented in a table in the next section of Item 2.

Nevada

We have been mining gold in Nevada since 1965. Nevada operations
    include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic
    feature known as the Carlin Trend, the Twin Creeks mine, located
    approximately 15 miles north of Golconda, and the Midas
    mine near the town of the same name. We also participate in the
    Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold
    Corp. (“Barrick”), which utilizes mill capacity at
    Twin Creeks. The Phoenix mine, located 10 miles south of
    Battle Mountain, commenced commercial production in the fourth
    quarter of 2006. The Leeville underground mine, located on the
    Carlin Trend northwest of the Carlin East underground mine, also
    commenced commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Gold sales from Nevada totaled approximately 2.2 million
    ounces for 2008 with ore mined from nine open pit and five
    underground mines. At year-end 2008, we reported
    28.1 million equity ounces of gold reserves in Nevada, with
    81% of those ounces in open pit mines and 19% in underground
    mines.

The Nevada operations produce gold from a variety of ore types
    requiring different processing techniques depending on economic
    and metallurgical characteristics. To ensure the best use of
    processing capacity, we use a linear programming model to guide
    the flow of both mining sequence selection and routing of ore
    streams to various plants. Refractory ores, which require more
    complex, higher cost processing methods, generated 72% of
    Nevada’s gold production in 2008, compared with 75% in
    2007, and 72% in 2006. With respect to remaining reserves, we
    estimate that approximately 81% are refractory ores and 19% are
    oxide ores. Higher-grade oxide ores are processed by
    conventional milling and cyanide leaching at Carlin (Mill
    5) and Twin Creeks (Juniper). Lower-grade material with
    suitable cyanide solubility is treated on heap leach pads at
    Carlin and Twin Creeks. Higher-grade refractory ores are
    processed through either a roaster at Carlin (Mill 6) or
    autoclaves at Twin Creeks (Sage). Lower-grade refractory ores
    are processed at Carlin by either bio-oxidation/flotation or
    direct flotation at Mill 5. Ore from the Midas mine is processed
    by conventional milling and Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation.
    Activated carbon from the various leaching circuits is treated
    to produce gold ore at the Carlin or Twin Creeks refineries.
    Zinc precipitate at Midas is refined

on-site.

We own, or control through long-term mining leases and
    unpatented mining claims, all of the minerals and surface area
    within the boundaries of the present Nevada mining operations
    (except for the Turquoise Ridge joint venture described below).
    The long-term leases extend for at least the anticipated mine
    life of those deposits. With respect to a significant portion of
    the Gold Quarry mine at Carlin, we own a 10% undivided interest
    in the mineral rights and lease the remaining 90%, on which we
    pay a royalty equivalent to 18% of the mineral production. We
    wholly-own or control the remainder of the Gold Quarry mineral
    rights, in some cases subject to additional royalties. With
    respect to certain smaller deposits in Nevada, we are obligated
    to pay royalties on production to third parties that vary from
    1% to 8% of production.

We have a 25% interest in a joint venture with Barrick to
    operate the Turquoise Ridge mine. Newmont has an agreement to
    provide up to 2,000 tons per day of milling capacity at Twin
    Creeks to the joint venture. Barrick is the operator of the
    joint venture. Gold sales of 50,065 ounces in 2008, 62,844
    ounces in 2007 and 58,300 ounces in 2006 were attributable to
    Newmont, based on our 25% ownership interest.

We have ore sale agreements with Barrick and Yukon-Nevada Gold
    Corp. (“Yukon-Nevada”) to process the Company’s
    ore. We recognized attributable gold sales, net of treatment
    charges, of 8,012 ounces in 2008, 58,624 ounces in 2007,
    and 99,500 ounces in 2006, pursuant to these



agreements. During 2008, Yukon-Nevada discontinued operations
    and it is unclear when they will resume.

We have sales and refining agreements with Gerald Metals,
    Peñoles, Johnson Matthey, Just Refiners and Glencore to
    process intermediate gold bearing product.

Yanacocha,
    Peru

The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L.
    (“Yanacocha”) are located approximately 375 miles
    (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers)
    north of the city of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began
    production in 1993. We hold a 51.35% interest in Yanacocha with
    the remaining interests held by Compañia de Minas
    Buenaventura, S.A.A. (43.65%) and the International Finance
    Corporation (5%).

Yanacocha has mining rights with respect to a large land
    position consisting of concessions granted by the Peruvian
    government to Yanacocha and a related entity. These mining
    concessions provide for both the right to explore and exploit.
    However, Yanacocha must first obtain the respective exploration
    and exploitation permits, which are generally granted in due
    course. Yanacocha may retain mining concessions indefinitely by
    paying annual fees and, during exploitation, complying with
    production obligations or paying assessed fines. Mining
    concessions are freely assignable or transferable.

Yanacocha currently has three active open pit mines, Cerro
    Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha. Reclamation

and/or

backfilling activities at Carachugo, San José and
    Maqui Maqui are currently underway. Yanacocha has four leach
    pads, three processing facilities, and a new mill, which
    achieved commercial production in the second quarter of 2008.
    Yanacocha’s gold sales for 2008 totaled 1.8 million
    ounces (0.9 million equity ounces). At year-end 2008, we
    reported 12.8 million equity ounces of gold reserves at
    Yanacocha, including 6.1 million equity ounces at Conga.The
    Yanacocha district contains the Conga deposit, for which we
    continue to evaluate the development plan for Conga.

Yanacocha, along with other mining companies in Peru, agreed
    with the central government in 2006 to contribute 3.75% of its
    net profits to fund social development projects for a period of
    up to five years, contingent upon metal prices remaining high.

Australia/New
    Zealand

In Australia, mineral exploration and mining titles are granted
    by the individual states or territories. Mineral titles may also
    be subject to native title legislation or, in the Northern
    Territory, to Aboriginal freehold title legislation that
    entitles indigenous persons to compensation calculated by
    reference to the gross value of production. In 1992, the High
    Court of Australia held that Aboriginal people who have
    maintained a continuing connection with their land according to
    their traditions and customs may hold certain rights in respect
    of the land (such rights commonly referred to as “native
    title”). Since the High Court’s decision, Australia
    has passed legislation providing for the protection of native
    title and established procedures for Aboriginal people to claim
    these rights. The fact that native title is claimed with respect
    to an area, however, does not necessarily mean that native title
    exists, and disputes may be resolved by the courts.

Generally, under native title legislation, all mining titles
    granted before January 1, 1994 are valid. Titles granted
    between January 1, 1994 and December 23, 1996,
    however, may be subject to invalidation if they were not
    obtained in compliance with applicable legislative procedures,
    though subsequent legislation has validated some of these
    titles. After December 23, 1996, mining titles over areas
    where native title is claimed to exist became subject to
    legislative processes that generally give native title claimants
    the “right to negotiate” with the title applicant for
    compensation and other conditions. Native title holders do not
    have a veto over the granting of mining titles, but if agreement
    cannot be reached, the matter can be referred to the National
    Native Title Tribunal for decision.



We do not expect that native title claims will have a material
    adverse effect on any of our operations in Australia. The High
    Court of Australia determined in an August 2002 decision, which
    refined and narrowed the scope of native title, that native
    title does not subsist in minerals in Western Australia and
    that the rights granted under a mining title would, to the
    extent inconsistent with asserted native title rights, operate
    to extinguish those native title rights. Generally, native title
    is only an issue for Newmont with respect to obtaining new
    mineral titles or moving from one form of title to another, for
    example, from an exploration title to a mining title. In these
    cases, the requirements for negotiation and the possibility of
    paying compensation may result in delay and increased costs for
    mining in the affected areas. Similarly, the process of
    conducting Aboriginal heritage surveys to identify and locate
    areas or sites of Aboriginal cultural significance can result in
    additional costs and delay in gaining access to land for
    exploration and mining-related activities.

In Australia, various ad valorem royalties are paid to state and
    territorial governments, typically based on a percentage of
    gross revenues and earnings.

Tanami.

The Tanami operations (100% owned)
    include The Granites treatment plant and associated mining
    operations, which are located in the Northern Territory
    approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice
    Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead Bullock
    Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40
    kilometers) west of The Granites. The Tanami operations have
    been wholly-owned since April 2003, when Newmont acquired the
    minority interests.

The Tanami operations are predominantly focused on the Callie
    underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak. Ore from the Tanami
    operations is processed through The Granites treatment plant.
    During 2008, the Tanami operations sold 364,900 ounces of gold.
    At year-end 2008, we reported 1.5 million equity ounces of
    gold reserves at Tanami.

Kalgoorlie.

The Kalgoorlie operations comprise
    the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit)
    and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder,
    373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth. The mines are
    managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd for the
    joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick, each of which holds a
    50% interest. The Super Pit is one of Australia’s largest
    gold mines in terms of gold production and annual mining volume.
    During 2008, the Kalgoorlie operations sold 304,400 equity
    ounces of gold. At year-end 2008, we reported 4.4 million
    equity ounces of gold reserves at Kalgoorlie.

Jundee.

The Jundee operation (100% owned) is
    situated approximately 435 miles (700 kilometers) northeast
    of Perth in Western Australia. We mined ore at Jundee solely
    from underground sources in 2008, with mill feed supplemented
    from oxide stockpiles for blending purposes. Jundee sold 376,900
    ounces of gold in 2008. At year-end 2008, we reported
    1.3 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Jundee.

Waihi.

The Waihi operations (100% owned) are
    located within the town of Waihi, located approximately
    68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New
    Zealand and consist of the Favona underground deposit and the
    Martha open pit. The Waihi operation sold 141,000 ounces of gold
    in 2008. At year-end 2008, we reported 0.4 million equity
    ounces of gold reserves at Waihi.

Boddington.

Boddington is a development
    project located 81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of
    Perth in Western Australia. At December 31, 2008,
    Boddington was owned by Newmont (66.67%) and AngloGold Ashanti
    Limited (“AngloGold”) (33.33%). On January 27,
    2009, the Company entered into a definitive sale and purchase
    agreement with AngloGold to acquire its 33.33% interest in the
    Boddington project. Upon expected completion of the acquisition,
    Newmont will own 100% of the project. Development of the
    Boddington project was approximately 89% complete as of
    December 31, 2008, with mill

start-up

expected in mid-2009. At year-end 2008, we reported
    13.4 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Boddington.



Batu Hijau,
    Indonesia

The Batu Hijau mine is located on the island of Sumbawa,
    approximately 950 miles (1,529 kilometers) east of Jakarta.
    Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which
    Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction
    activities began in 1997 and

start-up

occurred in late 1999. In 2008, copper sales were
    289.7 million pounds (130.4 million equity pounds),
    while gold sales were 298,900 ounces (134,500 equity ounces). At
    year-end 2008, we reported 3,950 million equity pounds of
    copper reserves and 4.1 million equity ounces of gold
    reserves at Batu Hijau.

We own 45% of the Batu Hijau mine through the Nusa Tenggara
    Partnership (“NTP”) with an affiliate of Sumitomo
    Corporation of Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTP and the
    Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTP in turn owns
    80% of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”), the
    Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. The remaining 20%
    interest in PTNNT is owned by P.T. Pukuafu Indah
    (“PTPI”), an unrelated Indonesian company. We are the
    operator of the Batu Hijau mine.

In Indonesia, rights are granted to foreign investors to explore
    for and to develop mineral resources within defined areas
    through Contracts of Work entered into with the Indonesian
    government. In 1986, PTNNT entered into a Contract of Work with
    the Indonesian government covering Batu Hijau, under which PTNNT
    was granted the exclusive right to explore in the contract area,
    construct any required facilities, extract and process the
    mineralized materials, and sell and export the minerals
    produced, subject to certain requirements including Indonesian
    government approvals and payment of royalties to the government.
    Under the Contract of Work, PTNNT has the right to continue
    operating the project for 30 years from operational

start-up,

or
    longer if approved by the Indonesian government.

Under the Contract of Work, beginning in 2006 and continuing
    through 2010, a portion of PTNNT’s shares must be offered
    for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or, second, to
    Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between the
    following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned
    by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such
    number is positive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by
    March 31, 2007; 37% by March 31, 2008; 44% by
    March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. The price
    at which such interest must be offered for sale to the
    Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current
    replacement cost, the price at which shares would be accepted
    for listing on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, or the fair market
    value of such interest as a going concern, as agreed with the
    Indonesian government. Pursuant to this provision, it is
    possible that the ownership interest of NTP in PTNNT could be
    reduced to 49%.

PTPI has owned and continues to own a 20% interest in PTNNT, and
    therefore NTP (the Newmont-Sumitomo partnership) was required to
    offer a 3% interest in PTNNT for sale in 2006 and an additional
    7% interest in each of 2007 and 2008. In accordance with the
    Contract of Work, an offer to sell a 3% interest was made to the
    Indonesian government in 2006 and an offer for an additional 7%
    interest was made in each of 2007 and 2008. While the central
    government declined to participate in the 2006 and 2007 offers,
    local governments in the area in which the Batu Hijau mine is
    located have expressed interest in acquiring shares, as have
    various Indonesian companies and nationals. In January 2008, NTP
    agreed to sell, under a carried interest arrangement, 2% of
    PTNNT’s shares to Kabupaten Sumbawa, one of the local
    governments, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. The
    Indonesian government has subsequently stated that it will not
    approve the transfer of shares under this agreement. On
    February 11, 2008, PTNNT received notification from the
    Department of Energy and Mineral Resources (“DEMR”)
    alleging that PTNNT is in breach of its divestiture requirements
    under the Contract of Work and threatening to issue a notice to
    terminate the Contract of Work if PTNNT did not agree to divest
    the 2006 and 2007 shares, in accordance with the direction
    of the DEMR, by February 22, 2008, which date was extended
    to March 3, 2008. A second Notice of Default was received
    relating to the alleged failure to divest the 2008 shares
    as well. On March 3, 2008, the Indonesian government filed
    for international arbitration, as did PTNNT, as provided under
    the Contract of Work. In the arbitration proceeding, PTNNT seeks
    a declaration that the Indonesian government is not entitled to
    terminate the Contract of Work and additional declarations
    pertaining to



the procedures for divesting the shares. For its part, the
    Indonesian government seeks declarations that PTNNT is in
    default of its divestiture obligations, that the Government may
    terminate the Contract of Work, and that PTNNT must cause shares
    subject to divestiture to be sold to certain local governments.
    An international arbitration panel was appointed and an
    arbitration hearing was held in Jakarta in December 2008. We
    anticipate a ruling will be issued in the first half of 2009.
    Newmont and Sumitomo believe there is no basis under the
    Contract of Work for the notifications and no grounds for
    terminating the Contract of Work, and PTNNT is vigorously
    defending the matter.

In 1997, to enable development of the Batu Hijau project, PTNNT
    secured an aggregate $1,000 in financing from the United States
    Export-Import Bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation
    (formerly the Japan Export-Import Bank), and Kreditanstalt fur
    Wiederaufbau (the German Export-Import Bank) (collectively, the
    “Senior Lenders”). The Senior Lenders required
    PTNNT’s shareholders to pledge 100% of the shares of PTNNT
    as security for repayment of the loans and interest. As part of
    that process, on October 30, 1997, the Minister of Energy
    and Mineral Resources approved the share pledge arrangements.

Subsequent to an additional 7% interest in PTNNT being offered
    by NTP for sale on March 28, 2008 (as required under the
    Contract of Work), the Director General of Mineral, Coal and
    Geothermal Resources at DEMR claimed that PTNNT breached its
    obligations under the Contract of Work by allowing shares to be
    offered for sale that are pledged to the Senior Lenders as
    security for the repayment of the senior debt. In the letter,
    the Director General claimed that NTP would be in default under
    the Contract of Work if the shares of PTNNT offered for sale in
    March 2008, together with the shares offered in 2006 and 2007,
    were not in the possession of “Indonesian government

and/or

government owned entities,” free of any such senior pledge,
    by July 13, 2008. Consequently, on July 10, 2008,
    PTNNT filed a notice to commence an additional international
    arbitration proceeding, as provided for under the Contract of
    Work, to resolve the claim that PTNNT breached its obligations
    under the Contract of Work by allowing shares to be offered that
    are subject to pledge obligations to the Senior Lenders. This
    pledge of shares issue has since been incorporated into, and
    will be resolved as part of the initial arbitration proceeding.

In addition, PTNNT has been in discussions to extend the forest
    use permit (called a “Pinjam Pakai”) for over three
    years. In 2005, Indonesian governmental authorities reviewed the
    contractual requirements for extension of the Pinjam Pakai and
    determined that PTNNT met those requirements. This permit is a
    key requirement to continue to operate Batu Hijau efficiently,
    in addition to the ultimate life of the mine and recoverability
    of reserves. However, the permit extension has not been received
    as of the date of this Annual Report. The resulting delay has
    adversely impacted Batu Hijau, and may adversely impact future
    operating and financial results, including deferment or
    cancellation of future mine development and operations.

Africa

Ahafo.

The Ahafo operation (100% owned) is
    located in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately
    180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. Ahafo poured
    its first gold on July 18, 2006 and commenced commercial
    production in August 2006. Ahafo sold 520,800 ounces of gold in
    2008.

We currently operate three open pits at Ahafo with reserves
    contained in 17 pits. The process plant consists of a
    conventional mill and

carbon-in-leach

circuit. Ahafo reserves as of December 31, 2008, were
    9.3 million equity ounces.

In December 2003, Ghana’s Parliament unanimously ratified
    an Investment Agreement between Newmont and the Government of
    Ghana. The Agreement establishes a fixed fiscal and legal
    regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of
    any Newmont project in Ghana. Under the Agreement, we will pay
    corporate income tax at the Ghana statutory tax rate (presently
    25% but not to exceed 32.5%) and fixed gross royalties on gold
    production of 3.0% (3.6% for any production from forest reserve
    areas). The Government of Ghana is also entitled to receive 10%
    of a project’s net cash flow after we have recouped our
    investment and may acquire up to 20% of a project’s equity
    at



fair market value on or after the 15th anniversary of such
    project’s commencement of production. The Investment
    Agreement also contains commitments with respect to job training
    for local Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local
    goods and services and environmental protection.

Akyem.

We have one development project in
    Ghana, currently the subject of further optimization studies.
    The Akyem project (100% owned) is located approximately
    80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. We continue
    to evaluate the development plan for Akyem.

Other
    Operations

Bolivia.

The Kori Kollo open pit mine is on a
    high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government
    mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa
    Minera Inti Raymi S.A. (“Inti Raymi”), in which we
    have an 88% interest. The remaining 12% is owned by
    Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado. Inti Raymi owns and operates the
    mine. The mill was closed in October 2003 and production
    continued from residual leaching. In 2005, additional material
    from the stockpiles and Lla Llagua pit were placed on the
    existing leach pad and ore from the Kori Chaca pit was processed
    on a new leach pad. In 2008, Inti Raymi sold 75,300 equity
    ounces of gold. At year-end 2008, we reported 0.2 million
    equity ounces of gold reserves at Inti Raymi.

Mexico.

We have a 44% interest in
    La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora
    desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which
    owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises an open pit
    operation with run-of-mine heap leach processing.
    La Herradura sold 95,200 equity ounces of gold in 2008. At
    year-end 2008, we reported 1.9 million equity ounces of
    gold reserves at La Herradura.

Other
    Property

Hope Bay.

With the successful completion of
    the acquisition of Miramar Mining Corporation in March 2008, we
    now own 100% of the Hope Bay project, a large undeveloped gold
    project in the Nunavut Territory of Canada. The acquisition and
    development of the Hope Bay project is consistent with the
    Company’s strategic focus on generating value through
    exploration and project development and was acquired with the
    intention of adding higher grade ore reserves and developing a
    new core gold mining district in a AAA-rated country.

Proven and
    Probable Equity Reserves

We had proven and probable gold reserves of 85.0 million
    equity ounces as of December 31, 2008.

For 2008, reserves were calculated at a $725, A$850 or NZ$1,000
    per ounce gold price assumption. Our 2008 reserves would decline
    by approximately 10% (8.2 million ounces), if calculated at
    a $675 per ounce gold price. An increase in the gold price to
    $775 per ounce would increase reserves by approximately 4%
    (3.3 million ounces), all other assumptions remaining
    constant. For 2007, reserves were calculated at a $575, A$750 or
    NZ$850 per ounce gold price assumption.

As of December 31, 2008, our proven and probable gold
    reserves in Nevada were 28.1 million equity ounces. Outside
    of Nevada, year-end proven and probable gold reserves were
    56.9 million equity ounces, including 20.9 million
    equity ounces in Australia/New Zealand, 17.0 million equity
    ounces in Ghana, 12.8 million equity ounces in Peru,
    4.1 million equity ounces in Indonesia and 2.1 million
    equity ounces at Other Operations.

Our proven and probable copper reserves as of December 31,
    2008 were 7,780 million equity pounds. For 2008, reserves
    were calculated at a price of $2.00 or A$2.40 per pound
    assumption. For 2007, reserves were calculated at a price of
    $1.75 or A$2.00 per pound assumption.

Under our current mining plans, all of our reserves are located
    on fee property or mining claims or will be depleted during the
    terms of existing mining licenses or concessions, or where
    applicable, any assured renewal or extension periods for such
    licenses or concessions.

Proven and probable equity reserves are based on extensive
    drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from
    which we determined economic feasibility. The price sensitivity
    of reserves depends upon several factors including grade,
    metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and
    ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the
    metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production
    process used. The reserve tables below list the average
    metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into
    account the several different processing methods that we use.
    The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralized material
    considered economic to process, varies with material type,
    metallurgical recoveries and operating costs.

The proven and probable equity reserve figures presented herein
    are estimates based on information available at the time of
    calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels
    of recovery of gold and copper will be realized. Ounces of gold
    or pounds of copper included in the proven and probable reserves
    are calculated without regard to any losses during metallurgical
    treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on
    actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold and
    copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced
    metallurgical recovery



rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves
    containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic
    to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves.

We publish reserves annually, and we will recalculate reserves
    as of December 31, 2009, taking into account metal prices,
    changes, if any, in future production and capital costs,
    divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and
    additions to reserves during 2009.

ITEM 5.

MARKET
    FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
    AND ISSUER PURCHASE OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Newmont’s common stock is listed and principally traded on
    the New York Stock Exchange (under the symbol “NEM”)
    and is also listed in the form of CHESS Depositary Interests
    (“CDIs”) (under the symbol “NEM”) on the
    Australian Stock Exchange (“ASX”). In Australia,
    Newmont is referred to as “Newmont Mining Corporation ARBN
    099 065 997 organized in Delaware with limited liability.”
    Since July 1, 2002, Newmont CDIs have traded on the ASX as
    a Foreign Exempt Listing granted by the ASX, which provides an
    ancillary trading facility to Newmont’s primary listing on
    NYSE. Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited’s
    exchangeable shares (“Exchangeable Shares”) are listed
    on the Toronto Stock Exchange (under the symbol
    “NMC”). The following table sets forth, for the
    periods indicated, the closing high and low sales prices per
    share of Newmont’s common stock as reported on the New York
    Stock Exchange Composite Tape.

On February 11, 2009, there were outstanding
    478,507,759 shares of Newmont’s common stock
    (including shares represented by CDIs), which were held by
    approximately 14,814 stockholders of record. A dividend of $0.10
    per share of common stock outstanding was declared in each
    quarter of 2008 and 2007, for a total of $0.40 during each year.

The determination of the amount of future dividends will be made
    by Newmont’s Board of Directors from time to time and will
    depend on Newmont’s future earnings, capital requirements,
    financial condition and other relevant factors.

On February 11, 2009, there were outstanding 10,687,382
    Exchangeable Shares, which were held by 46 holders of record.
    The Exchangeable Shares are exchangeable at the option of the
    holders into Newmont common stock. Holders of Exchangeable
    Shares are therefore entitled to receive dividends equivalent to
    those that Newmont declares on its common stock.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share,
    per ounce and per pound amounts)

The following discussion provides information that management
    believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the
    consolidated financial condition and results of operations of
    Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively,
    “Newmont,” the “Company,” “our”
    and “we”). References to “A$” refer to
    Australian currency, “C$” to Canadian currency,
    “NZ$” to New Zealand currency, “IDR” to
    Indonesian currency and “$” to United States currency.

This discussion addresses matters we consider important for an
    understanding of our financial condition and results of
    operations as of and for the three years ended December 31,
    2008, as well as our future results. It consists of the
    following subsections:

•

“Overview,”

which provides a brief summary of
    our consolidated results and financial position and the primary
    factors affecting those results, as well as a summary of our
    expectations for 2009;

•

“Accounting Developments,”

which provides a
    discussion of recent changes to our accounting policies that
    have affected our consolidated results and financial position;

•

“Critical Accounting Policies,”

which provides
    an analysis of the accounting policies we consider critical
    because of their effect on the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, income

and/or

expenses in our consolidated financial statements

and/or

because they require difficult, subjective or complex judgments
    by our management;

•

“Consolidated Financial Results,”

which
    includes a discussion of our consolidated financial results for
    the last three years;

•

“Results of Consolidated Operations,”

which

    activities and financing activities, contractual obligations and
    off-balance sheet arrangements.

This item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
    financial statements and the notes thereto included in this
    annual report.

Overview

Newmont is one of the world’s largest gold producers and is
    the only gold company included in the S&P 500 Index and
    Fortune 500, and was the first gold company included in the Dow
    Jones Sustainability Index-World. We are also engaged in the
    exploration for and acquisition of gold properties. We have
    significant assets or operations in the United States,
    Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, New Zealand and
    Mexico.

We face key risks associated with our business. One of the
    most significant risks is fluctuation in the prices of gold and
    copper, which are affected by numerous factors beyond our
    control. Other challenges we face include capital and production
    cost increases and social, political and environmental issues.
    Operating costs at our mines are subject to variation due to a
    number of factors, such as changing commodity prices, ore
    grades, metallurgy, revisions to mine plans and changes in
    accounting principles. At foreign locations, operating costs are
    also influenced by currency fluctuations that may affect our
    U.S. dollar operating costs. In addition, we must
    continually replace reserves depleted



through production by expanding known ore bodies, by acquisition
    or by locating new deposits in order to offset the organic
    decline in production levels which occurs over the long term.

Consolidated
    Financial Performance

Gold revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due
    to an increase in the average realized price and an increase in
    consolidated gold ounces sold. Gold sales increased to
    6.3 million ounces in 2008 from 6.2 million ounces in
    2007, primarily due to higher production at Yanacocha, Ahafo and
    Australia/New Zealand, partially offset by lower production at
    Batu Hijau and Nevada. Copper revenues decreased in 2008 from
    2007 due to lower throughput, grade and recovery at
    Batu Hijau and a decrease in the average realized price
    (see Results of Consolidated Operations below).

The gold price increases over the last three years were
    partially offset by lower production and higher production costs
    as we have seen significant increases in the costs of labor,
    fuel, power and other bulk consumables. In addition, our 2008
    financial and operating results were impacted by the following:

•

Reclamation and remediation costs ($102, primarily at former
    mining operations);

•

Advanced projects, research and development expense ($166,
    primarily at our Fort a la Corne JV diamond, Hope Bay,
    Euronimba and Ghana investments);

•

Losses on write-down of marketable equity securities and other
    assets ($251, as the credit crisis affected the market for
    junior mining companies);



•

Write-down of property, plant and mine development ($137,
    primarily related to assets in Canada, Indonesia and
    Nevada); and

•

Tax planning and restructuring ($159).

During 2008 our debt and liquidity positions were affected by
    the following:

•

Net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $591;

•

Net cash provided from continuing operations of $1,403;

•

Capital expenditures of $1,875;

•

Completion of the Miramar acquisition for $325;

•

Dividends paid to common shareholders of $182;

•

Dividends paid to minority interests of $389; and

•

Changes in the value of our marketable equity securities as a
    result of broad declines in the equity markets.

Looking
    Forward

Certain key factors will affect our future financial and
    operating results. These include, but are not limited to, the
    following:

•

Fluctuations in gold and copper prices;

•

We expect higher 2009 consolidated gold sales of approximately
    6.35 to 6.85 million ounces, primarily as a result of the

start-up

of
    Boddington, completion of the acquisition of the remaining
    33.33% of Boddington, as well as increased gold sales at
    Yanacocha and Batu Hijau, partially offset by lower sales in
    Nevada;

•

Costs applicable to sales — gold

for 2009 are
    expected to be approximately $400 to $440 per ounce due to the

start-up

of
    lower cost production from Boddington (100%), higher expected
    gold sales from our Yanacocha and Batu Hijau operations, as well
    as lower oil price and Australian dollar exchange rate
    assumptions, partially offset by lower by-product credits
    resulting from lower copper price assumptions;

•

We expect 2009 consolidated copper sales of approximately 460 to
    510 million pounds at

Costs applicable to sales

of
    approximately $0.65 to $0.75 per pound as a result of higher
    expected sales, processing higher grade ore and lower waste
    removal costs.

•

We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1,400 to
    $1,600 in 2009, with approximately 60% in Australia/New Zealand,
    15% in Nevada and the remaining 25% invested at other locations.
    Approximately 45% of the 2009 capital budget is allocated to
    sustaining investments, with the remaining 55% allocated to
    project development initiatives, including completion of the
    Boddington project (100%) in Australia;



•

In March 2009, we expect to close the acquisition transaction
    for the additional 33.33% interest in Boddington from AngloGold
    Ashanti Ltd. for $750 payable in cash at closing, $240 payable
    in cash

and/or

Newmont common stock, at our option, in December 2009, and a
    royalty capped at $100, equal to 50% of the average realized
    operating margin (Revenue less

Costs applicable to sales

on a by-product basis), if any, exceeding $600 per ounce,
    payable on one-third of gold sales from Boddington.

•

We expect 2009 exploration expenditures of approximately $165 to
    $175 and 2009 advanced projects, research and development
    expenditures of approximately $120 to $150.

•

In February 2009, we completed a public offering of $518
    convertible senior notes, maturing February 15, 2012 for
    net proceeds of $504.

•

In February 2009, we completed a public offering of 34,500,000
    of our common shares for net proceeds of $1,233.

•

The completion of the Boddington project as well as potential
    future investments in the Hope Bay project in Canada, the Akyem
    project in Ghana and the Conga project in Peru will require
    significant funding. Our operating cash flow may become
    insufficient to meet the funding requirements of these
    investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay
    dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new
    sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic
    conditions, future gold and copper prices and our operational
    performance, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and
    copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges,
    or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business
    opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our
    ongoing business activities and pay dividends could be
    significantly constrained; and

•

Our 2009 expectations, particularly with respect to sales
    volumes and costs applicable to sales per ounce or pound, may
    differ significantly from actual quarter and full year results
    due to the

start-up

of
    our Boddington project (100%) and variations in: mine planning
    and sequencing, ore grades and hardness, metal recoveries, waste
    removal, commodity input prices, foreign currency exchange rates
    and gold and copper sales prices.

Accounting
    Developments

Variable
    Interest Entities

In December 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Staff Position No.

FAS 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8, “Disclosures by Public Entities
    (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests
    in Variable Interest Entities” (“FSP

FAS 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8”). This FSP amends FASB Statement
    No. 140 “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
    Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities” to
    require public entities to provide additional disclosures about
    transfers of financial assets. It also amends FASB
    Interpretation No. 46 “Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities” as revised to require public enterprises
    to provide additional disclosures about their involvement with
    Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”). FSP

FAS 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8 are effective for the Company’s fiscal
    year ending December 31, 2008. Newmont has adopted the
    disclosure requirements of FSP

FAS 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8 in the Company’s VIE disclosures.

Hierarchy of
    Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 162,
    “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles” (“FAS 162”) which identifies the
    sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting
    the principles to be used in the preparation of financial
    statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles (“GAAP”). FAS 162 was effective
    November 15, 2008, which was 60 days following the
    Security and Exchange Commission’s approval of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU
    Section 411, “

The Meaning of

Present Fairly in
    Conformity with GAAP.” The



adoption of FAS 162 has had no impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Fair Value
    Accounting

In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”).
    FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
    principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. The provisions of FAS 157 were adopted
    January 1, 2008. In February 2008, the FASB staff issued
    FSP No.

157-2

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”
    (“FSP

FAS 157-2”).

FSP

FAS 157-2

delayed the effective date of FAS 157 for nonfinancial
    assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The
    provisions of FSP

FAS 157-2

are effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1,
    2009, and are not expected to have a significant impact on the
    Company.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 157-3,

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset Is Not Active” (“FSP

FAS 157-3”),

which clarifies the application of FASB Statement No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”)
    in an inactive market. The intent of this FSP is to provide
    guidance on how the fair value of a financial asset is to be
    determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive.
    FSP

FAS 157-3 states

that determining fair value in an inactive market depends on the
    facts and circumstances, requires the use of significant
    judgment and in some cases, observable inputs may require
    significant adjustment based on unobservable data. Regardless of
    the valuation technique used, an entity must include appropriate
    risk adjustments that market participants would make for
    nonperformance and liquidity risks when determining fair value
    of an asset in an inactive market. FSP

FAS 157-3

was effective upon issuance. We have incorporated the principles
    of FSP

FAS 157-3

in determining the fair value of financial assets when the
    market for those assets is not active, specifically its
    marketable debt securities.

FAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
    the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
    The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
    (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to
    unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three
    levels of the fair value hierarchy under FAS 157 are
    described below:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible
    at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or
    liabilities;

Level 2

Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are
    observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
    full term of the asset or liability;

Level 3

Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both
    significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable
    (supported by little or no market activity).



The following table sets forth our financial assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value by level within the fair
    value hierarchy. As required by FAS 157, assets and
    liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest
    level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Our cash equivalent instruments are classified within
    Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued
    using quoted market prices. The cash instruments that are valued
    based on quoted market prices in active markets are primarily
    money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities.

Our marketable equity securities are valued using quoted market
    prices in active markets and as such are classified within
    Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the
    marketable equity securities is calculated as the quoted market
    price of the marketable equity security multiplied by the
    quantity of shares held by us.

Our marketable debt securities include investments in auction
    rate securities and asset backed commercial paper. We review
    fair value for auction rate securities and asset backed
    commercial paper on at least a quarterly basis. The auction rate
    securities are traded in markets that are not active, trade
    infrequently and have little price transparency. We estimated
    the fair values based on weighted average risk calculations
    using probabilistic cash flow assumptions. In January 2009, the
    investments in our asset backed commercial paper were
    restructured under court order. The restructuring allowed an
    interest distribution to be made to investors. The auction rate
    securities and asset backed commercial paper are classified
    within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Our net trade payable from provisional copper and gold
    concentrate sales is valued using quoted market prices based on
    the forward London Metal Exchange (“LME”) (copper) and
    the London Bullion Market Association P.M. fix (“London
    P.M. fix”) (gold) and, as such, is classified within
    Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

Our derivative instruments are valued using pricing models and
    we generally use similar models to value similar instruments.
    Where possible, we verify the values produced by our pricing
    models to market prices. Valuation models require a variety of
    inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield
    curves, credit spreads, measures of volatility, and correlations
    of such inputs. Our derivatives trade in liquid markets, and as
    such, model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve
    significant management judgment. Such instruments are classified
    within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

We have fixed to floating swap contracts to hedge a portion of
    the interest rate risk exposure of our


/


%
    uncollateralized debentures due May 2011. The hedged portion of
    our


/


% debentures
    are valued using pricing models which require inputs, including
    risk-free interest rates and credit spreads. Because the inputs
    are derived from observable market data, the hedged portion of
    the


/


% debentures
    is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.



The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair
    value of our Level 3 financial assets (asset backed
    commercial paper and auction rate securities) for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

    December 31, 2008, the assets classified within
    Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy represent 4% of the
    total assets measured at fair value.

In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (“FAS 159”). FAS 159
    permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments
    and certain other items at fair value, with the objective of
    improving financial reporting by mitigating volatility in
    reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and
    liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge
    accounting provisions. The provisions of FAS 159 were
    adopted January 1, 2008. We did not elect the Fair Value
    Option for any of our financial assets or liabilities, and
    therefore, the adoption of FAS 159 had no impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Accounting for
    Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment
    Awards

In June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
    reached consensus on Issue

No. 06-11,

“Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
    Share-Based Payment Awards”

(“EITF 06-11”).

EITF 06-11

requires that the tax benefit related to dividend and dividend
    equivalents paid on equity-classified nonvested shares and
    nonvested share units, which are expected to vest, be recorded
    as an increase to additional paid-in capital.

EITF 06-11

has been applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends
    declared in our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008. The
    adoption of

EITF 06-11

had an insignificant impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Income
    Taxes

On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB
    Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes,” (“FIN 48”) an interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income
    Taxes.” FIN 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting
    for uncertainties in the application of the income tax laws to
    our operations. The interpretation prescribes a comprehensive
    model for the financial statement recognition, measurement,
    presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax provisions taken or
    expected to be taken in income tax returns. The cumulative
    effects of applying this interpretation were recorded as a
    decrease in retained earnings of $108, an increase of $5 in
    goodwill, an increase of $4 in minority interest, a decrease in
    net deferred tax assets of $37 (primarily, as a result of
    utilization of foreign tax credits and net operating losses as
    part of the FIN 48 measurement process, offset, in part, by
    the impact of the interaction of the Alternative Minimum Tax
    rules) and an increase of $72 in the net liability for
    unrecognized income tax benefits.

Pensions

As of December 31, 2006, we adopted the provisions of FASB
    Statement No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post-Retirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and 132(R)” (“FAS 158”).
    FAS 158 requires employers that sponsor one or more defined
    benefit plans to (i) recognize the funded status of a
    benefit plan in its statement of financial position,
    (ii) recognize the gains or losses and prior service costs
    or credits that arise during the period as a component of other
    comprehensive income, net of tax, (iii) measure the defined



benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the
    employer’s fiscal year-end statement of financial position,
    and (iv) disclose in the notes to the financial statements
    additional information about certain effects on net periodic
    cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed
    recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or
    credits, and transition asset or obligation. The impact of
    adopting FAS 158 decreased

Accumulated other
    comprehensive income

by $27 as of December 31, 2006.

Stock Based
    Compensation

On January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition
    provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R),
    “

Share-Based Payment

”
    (“FAS 123(R)”). We adopted FAS 123(R) using
    the modified prospective transition method. Under this method,
    compensation cost recognized in 2006 included:
    a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted
    prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based
    on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the

Deferred
    Stripping Costs

On January 1, 2006 we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force
    Issue

No. 04-06

(“EITF 04-06”),

“Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production
    in the Mining Industry.”

EITF 04-06

addresses the accounting for stripping costs incurred during the
    production phase of a mine and refers to these costs as variable
    production costs that should be included as a component of
    inventory to be recognized in

Costs applicable to sales

in the same period as the revenue from the sale of
    inventory. As a result, capitalization of post-production
    stripping costs is appropriate only to the extent product
    inventory exists at the end of a reporting period. The guidance
    required the recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment to
    opening retained earnings in the period of adoption, with no
    charge to earnings in the period of adoption for prior periods.
    The cumulative effect adjustment reduced retained earnings by
    $81 (net of tax and minority interests). Adoption of

EITF 04-06

had no impact on our cash position or net cash from operations.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are
    critical to our financial statements due to the degree of
    uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and
    the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being
    reported.

Carrying Value
    of Goodwill

As of December 31, 2008, the carrying value of goodwill was
    approximately $188. Goodwill represents the excess of the
    aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable
    net assets. Goodwill was assigned to various mine site reporting
    units in the Australia/New Zealand Segment. Our approach to
    allocating goodwill was to identify those reporting units that
    we believed had contributed to such excess purchase price. We
    then performed valuations to measure the incremental increases
    in the fair values of such reporting units that were
    attributable to the acquisitions, and that were not already
    captured in the fair values assigned to such units’
    identifiable net assets.

We evaluate, on at least an annual basis, the carrying amount of
    goodwill to determine whether current events and circumstances
    indicate that such carrying amount may no longer be recoverable.



To accomplish this, we compare the estimated fair values of the
    reporting units to their carrying amounts. If the carrying value
    of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value at the time of the
    evaluation, we would compare the implied fair value of the
    reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying amount and any
    shortfall would be charged to earnings. Assumptions underlying
    fair value estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Mine Site
    Goodwill

The assignment of goodwill to mine site reporting units was
    based on synergies that have been incorporated into our
    operations and business plans over time. The amount of goodwill
    assigned to each segment or reporting unit was based on
    discounted cash flow analyses that assumed risk-adjusted
    discount rates over the remaining lives of the applicable mining
    operations. We believe that triggering events with respect to
    the goodwill assigned to mine site reporting units could
    include, but are not limited to: (i) a significant decrease
    in our long-term gold and copper price assumptions; (ii) a
    decrease in reserves; (iii) a significant reduction in the
    estimated fair value of mine site exploration potential; and
    (iv) any event that might otherwise adversely affect mine
    site production levels or costs. We performed our annual
    impairment test of mine site goodwill as of December 31,
    2008 and determined that the fair value of each mine site
    reporting unit was in excess of the relevant carrying value as
    of December 31, 2008. For more information on the
    discounted cash flows used to value mine site reporting units,
    see Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets, below.

Exploration
    Segment Goodwill

In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Exploration Segment was
    impaired and the full value of goodwill was written-off. The
    Exploration Segment is responsible for all activities, whether
    near-mine or greenfield, associated with the Company’s
    efforts to discover new mineralized material that could
    ultimately advance into proven and probable reserves. As
    discussed in greater detail below, when performing its
    Exploration Segment goodwill impairment testing, the Company
    used historic additions to proven and probable reserves as an
    indication of the expected future performance of the Exploration
    Segment.

The Exploration Segment’s valuation model attributed all
    cash flows expected to be derived from future greenfield
    exploration discoveries, to the Exploration Segment. The
    valuation model included management’s best estimates of
    future reserve additions from exploration activities and all
    revenues and costs associated with their discovery, development
    and production. Historical proven and probable reserve
    additions, excluding acquisitions, were used as an indicator of
    the Exploration Segment’s ability to discover additional
    reserves in the future. The valuation model assumed that the
    Company would be able to perpetually develop and produce the
    assumed additions to proven and probable reserves from future
    discoveries at existing or new mine site reporting units. Actual
    reserve additions have varied significantly from year to year
    due to the time required to advance a deposit from initial
    discovery to proven and probable reserves and based on the
    timing of when proven and probable reserves can be reported
    under the Securities and Exchange Commission Industry Guide 7.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, we performed an impairment test
    of the Exploration Segment goodwill. Based on the Exploration
    Segment’s historic additions to proven and probable
    reserves and management’s best estimates of future reserve
    additions from exploration activities and all revenues and costs
    associated with their discovery, development and production, the
    Exploration Segment’s estimated fair value was negligible.
    The decreased value attributable to the Exploration Segment
    resulted primarily from adverse changes in valuation assumptions
    and the application of a revised industry definition of value
    beyond proved and probable reserves (“VBPP”). The
    changes to valuation assumptions included: (i) a
    significantly lower assumed annual reserve growth rate (from 4%
    to 3%), (ii) a significant change in the financial markets
    resulting in a significant increase in the discount rate (from
    8% to 10%), and (iii) an increase in finding costs due to a
    combination of increased spending and reduced exploration
    success. The revised definition of VBPP ascribes more value to
    tangible mineral interest than the original definition used by
    the Company. As a result of applying the new



definition of VBPP, the higher value ascribed to the Exploration
    Segment’s tangible mineral interests reduced the implied
    value of the Exploration Segment’s goodwill to a negligible
    value. Based on the negligible valuation, the Exploration
    Segment goodwill was impaired and the full $1,122 of goodwill
    was recorded as a non-cash write-down as of December 31,
    2007.

Merchant
    Banking Goodwill

During June 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan to
    cease Merchant Banking activities. Merchant Banking previously
    provided advisory services to assist in managing our portfolio
    of operating and property interests. Merchant Banking was also
    engaged in developing value optimization strategies for
    operating and non-operating assets, business development
    activities, merger and acquisition analysis and negotiations,
    monetizing inactive exploration properties, capitalizing on
    proprietary technology and know-how and acting as an internal
    resource for other corporate groups to improve and maximize
    business outcomes. As a result of the Board’s approval of
    management’s plan to cease Merchant Banking activities, we
    recorded a $1,665 non-cash charge to impair the goodwill
    associated with the Merchant Banking Segment during the second
    quarter of 2007.

Amortization

Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures
    that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment
    are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method
    at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated
    future lives of such facilities or equipment. These lives do not
    exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable
    reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to
    be limited to the life of the relevant mine.

Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as
    incurred, where it has been determined that the property can be
    economically developed based on the existence of proven and
    probable reserves. At our surface mines, these costs include
    costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to
    initially expose the ore body. At our underground mines, these
    costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking
    and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and
    infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using
    the units-of-production (“UOP”) method over the
    estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable
    ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves.

Major development costs incurred after the commencement of
    production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated
    recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable
    reserves. To the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore
    body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces
    or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore
    body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that
    only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are
    amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in
    proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area.

The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore
    the annual amortization charge to operations, could be
    materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the
    future is different from current forecasts of production based
    on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to
    the extent that there were significant changes in any of the
    factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These
    factors could include: (i) an expansion of proven and
    probable reserves through exploration activities;
    (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of
    production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates
    and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences
    between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions
    used in the estimation of reserves. If reserves decreased
    significantly, amortization charged to operations would
    increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly,
    amortization charged to operations would decrease. Such changes
    in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets
    depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are
    limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the
    life of the proven and probable reserves.



The expected useful lives used in amortization calculations are
    determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as
    described above. Significant judgment is involved in the
    determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given
    that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the
    useful lives assumed for the purpose of amortization
    calculations.

Carrying Value
    of Stockpiles

Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine
    and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured
    by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the
    stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on
    assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates
    (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore
    tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated
    to stockpiles based on relative values of material stockpiled
    and processed using current mining costs incurred up to the
    point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable overhead and
    amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are added to a
    stockpile based on current mining costs and removed at each
    stockpile’s average cost per recoverable ounce of gold or
    pound of copper in the stockpile. Stockpiles are reduced as
    material is removed and processed further. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, our stockpiles had a total
    carrying value of $993 (Batu Hijau, $612; Nevada, $214;
    Australia/New Zealand, $98; others, $69) and $732, respectively.

Costs that are incurred in or benefit from the productive
    process are accumulated as stockpiles. We record stockpiles at
    the lower of average cost or net realizable value
    (“NRV”), and carrying values are evaluated at least
    quarterly. NRV represents the estimated future sales price based
    on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs
    to complete production and bring the product to sale. The
    primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of
    stockpiles include short-term and long-term metals prices and
    costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy,
    materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and
    actual production levels. The significant assumptions in
    determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit as of
    December 31, 2008, included production cost and capitalized
    expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, and a
    long-term gold price of $800 per ounce. If short-term and
    long-term metals prices decrease, the value of the stockpiles
    decrease, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of
    stockpiles to NRV. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, write-downs of
    stockpiles to NRV totaled $2, $14 and $2, respectively.

Cost allocation to stockpiles and the NRV measurement involves
    the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining
    operation regarding current and future operating and capital
    costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices,
    proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and
    other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in
    determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can
    be given that actual results will not differ significantly from
    those estimates and assumptions.

Carrying Value
    of Ore on Leach Pads

Ore on leach pads represent ore that has been mined, crushed,
    and placed on leach pads where a weak cyanide solution is
    applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. Costs
    are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs,
    including applicable amortization relating to mining operations.
    Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered
    based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of
    gold on the leach pad.

The estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are
    calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads
    (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed
    on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery
    percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover
    between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year
    of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching
    process is complete.

Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach
    pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on
    pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical
    balancing),



the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability
    to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the
    metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and
    estimates are refined based on actual results over time.
    Historically, the Company’s operating results have not been
    materially impacted by variations between the estimated and
    actual recoverable quantities of gold on its leach pads.
    Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting
    from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in
    write-downs to NRV are accounted for on a prospective basis. The
    significant assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine
    site reporting unit as of December 31, 2008, apart from
    production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique
    to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $800 per
    ounce, a long-term copper price of $2.25 per pound and
    U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $0.75 per
    A$1.00. If short-term and long-term metals prices decrease, the
    value of the ore on leach pads decrease, and it may be necessary
    to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to NRV. During 2008,
    the Company recorded write-downs of $18 to reduce the carrying
    value of ore on leach pads to NRV, primarily related to Kori
    Kollo (Other operations).

Carrying Value
    of Long-Lived Assets

We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related
    carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An asset impairment is
    considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on
    an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the
    asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is
    measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash
    flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated
    quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other
    commodity prices (considering current and historical prices,
    trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs,
    capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on
    life-of-mine plans. The significant assumptions in determining
    the NRV for each mine site reporting unit as of
    December 31, 2008, apart from production cost and
    capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation,
    included a long-term gold price of $800 per ounce, a long-term
    copper price of $2.25 per pound and U.S. to Australian
    dollar exchange rate of $0.75 per A$1.00. During 2008, the
    Company recorded write-downs of $137 to reduce the carrying
    value of property, plant and mine development, primarily related
    to mineral interests and other assets in Canada, Indonesia and
    Nevada.

Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven
    and probable reserves, including mineralization other than
    proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part
    of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are
    included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting
    units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether
    the assets are impaired. The term “recoverable
    minerals” refers to the estimated amount of gold or other
    commodities that will be obtained after taking into account
    losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of
    recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral
    interests are risk adjusted based on management’s relative
    confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows,
    assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are
    identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future
    cash flows from other asset groups.

As discussed above under Amortization, various factors could
    impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production
    schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally,
    production, capital and reclamation costs could differ from the
    assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess
    impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of
    recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests
    involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable
    to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have
    been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the
    identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined
    economically. Assets classified as exploration potential have
    the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset
    can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of
    geological confidence and economic modeling.



Derivative
    Instruments

With the exception of the Call Spread Transactions (as described
    below in Note 21), all financial instruments that meet the
    definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at
    fair market value. Changes in the fair market value of
    derivatives are recorded in the statements of consolidated
    income (loss), except for the effective portion of the change in
    fair market value of derivatives that are designated as a cash
    flow hedge and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
    Management applies significant judgment in estimating the fair
    value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions
    regarding commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign
    currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations in these
    factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to
    earnings to reflect the changes in fair market value of
    derivatives. Certain derivative contracts are accounted for as
    cash flow hedges, whereby the effective portion of changes in
    fair market value of these instruments are deferred in

Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income

and will be
    recognized in the statements of consolidated income (loss) when
    the underlying transaction designated as the hedged item impacts
    earnings. All derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow
    hedges are designated against future foreign currency
    expenditures or future diesel expenditures, where management
    believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. To
    the extent that management determines that such future foreign
    currency or diesel expenditures are no longer probable of
    occurring, gains and losses deferred in

Accumulated other
    comprehensive (loss) income

would be reclassified to the
    statements of consolidated income (loss) immediately.

Reclamation
    and Remediation Obligations (Asset Retirement
    Obligations)

Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the
    related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes
    in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of
    time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or
    amount of the reclamation and remediation costs. The asset
    retirement obligation is based on when the spending for an
    existing environmental disturbance will occur. We review, on at
    least an annual basis, the asset retirement obligation at each
    mine site in accordance with FASB Statement No. 143,
    “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.”

Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on
    management’s best estimate of the costs expected to be
    incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where
    applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs.
    Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings
    in the period an estimate is revised.

Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires
    management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of
    the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and
    remediation work required to comply with existing laws and
    regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could
    differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to
    environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of
    reclamation and remediation work required. Any such increases in
    future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to
    earnings for reclamation and remediation.

Income and
    Mining Taxes

We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax
    assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than
    not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred
    tax assets requires management to make significant estimates
    related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of
    future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the
    application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer
    above under Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion
    of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from
    estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable
    income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to
    realize deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date
    could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in
    the jurisdictions in which we operate could limit our ability to
    obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax
    assets recorded at the reporting date.



Our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments
    in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple
    jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many
    factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in
    various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from
    federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize
    potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated
    tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions
    based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,
    additional taxes will be due. As of January 1, 2007, we
    adopted FIN 48 guidance to record these liabilities (refer
    to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of
    changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity
    of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may
    result in a payment that is materially different from our
    current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax
    liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an
    additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these
    amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts,
    the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits
    being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities
    are no longer necessary. We recognize interest and penalties, if
    any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Costs applicable to sales — gold

increased in
    2008 compared to 2007 due to higher diesel costs and higher
    royalty and workers participation expenses, partially offset by
    lower waste removal costs at Batu Hijau and higher by-product
    sales. The increase in 2007 from 2006 resulted from increased
    labor and diesel costs, the strengthening of the Australian
    dollar, a full year of operations at Ahafo in Ghana and Phoenix
    and Leeville in Nevada and higher waste removal costs at Batu
    Hijau.

Costs applicable to sales — copper

decreased in 2008 from 2007 due to lower waste removal
    costs, partially offset by higher diesel, labor and milling
    costs.

Costs applicable to sales — copper

increased in 2007 from 2006 due to higher waste removal
    costs at Batu Hijau. For a complete discussion regarding
    variations in operations, see

Results of Consolidated
    Operations

below.

Amortization

increased in 2008 from 2007 due to increased
    production at Australia/New Zealand and Ahafo, a larger portion
    of Nevada production being sourced from the Phoenix and Leeville
    operations and the

start-up

of
    the gold mill at Yanacocha and the power plant in Nevada.

Amortization

increased in 2007 from 2006 due to a full
    year of operations at Phoenix and Leeville in Nevada and Ahafo
    in Ghana.

Amortization

expense fluctuates as capital
    expenditures increase or decrease and as production levels
    increase or decrease due to the use of the units-of production
    amortization method for mineral interests and mine development.
    For a complete discussion, see

Results of Consolidated
    Operations

Amortization

to increase
    to approximately $775 to $825 in 2009 (with 100% ownership of
    the Boddington project).

The

Loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales
    contracts

of $531 in 2007 resulted from the elimination of
    the entire 1.85 million ounces of forward sales contracts
    that would have impacted results in 2008 and beyond.

Midas redevelopment

of $11 in 2007 resulted from
    activities undertaken, during the period in which operations
    were suspended, to regain entry into the mine in order to resume
    commercial production following a fatal accident that occurred
    in June 2007.

Exploration

increased to $214 in 2008 from $177 in 2007
    reflecting increased activity in response to higher gold prices
    and increased drilling, labor and consumable costs primarily at
    Hope Bay, Ghana and Conga. We expect

Exploration

spending
    to be approximately $165 to $175 in 2009, a decrease from 2008,
    due to a reduced drilling program related to the Company’s
    focus on net cash flow generation and a more selective and
    strategic exploration program. The decrease may adversely



affect the timing and extent of new mineral discoveries and the
    replacement of reserves. Once mineralization is discovered, it
    will likely take many years from the initial phases of
    exploration until production, during which time the economic
    feasibility of production may change.

    acquisition; the Fort a la Corne JV diamond project in
    Saskatchewan, Canada; the Euronimba iron ore project in Guinea;
    the Akyem gold project in Ghana and the Conga copper and gold
    project in Peru. Fort a la Corne JV was included in

Exploration

in 2007 and 2006 with spending of $17 and $6,
    respectively. We expect

Advanced projects, research and
    development

spending to be approximately $120 to $150 in
    2009, a decrease from 2008, due to a focus on net cash flow
    generation. The decrease in project development spending may
    adversely affect the timing of our ability to complete certain
    projects.

General and administrative

expense remained stable over
    the period from 2006 to 2008.

General and administrative

expense as a percentage of revenues was 2.3% in 2008,
    compared to 2.6% and 2.8% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. We
    expect

General and administrative

expenses to be
    approximately $140 to $150 in 2009.

Write-down of goodwill

in 2007 was $1,122 ($nil for 2008
    and 2006) and was related to the Exploration segment. The
    impairment resulted primarily from adverse changes in valuation
    assumptions and the application of a revised industry definition
    of value beyond proven and probable reserves (“VBPP”).
    The changes to valuation assumptions included: (i) a
    significantly lower assumed annual reserve growth rate (from 4%
    to 3%), (ii) a significant change in the financial markets
    resulting in a significant increase in the discount rate (from
    8% to 10%), and (iii) an increase in finding costs due to a
    combination of increased spending and reduced exploration
    success. The revised definition of VBPP ascribes more value to
    tangible mineral interest than the original definition used by
    the Company. As a result of applying the new definition of VBPP,
    the higher value ascribed to the Exploration Segment’s
    tangible mineral interests reduced the implied value of the
    Exploration Segment’s goodwill to a negligible value.

Write-down of property, plant and mine development

totaled $137, $10 and $3 for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The 2008 write-down primarily related to mineral
    interests and other assets in Canada, Indonesia and Nevada. The
    Fort a la Corne JV assets were impaired based on 2008
    geologic results and potential project economics leading to our
    decision to cease funding our share of project development costs
    after January 2009. The assets were written-down to estimated
    recoverable value. The 2007 write-down primarily related to
    assets in Indonesia and Australia. The 2006 write-down related
    to assets in Peru and Indonesia.

For a discussion of our policy for assessing the carrying value
    of goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, see Critical
    Accounting Policies, above.

Reclamation estimate revisions relate to changes in
    environmental obligation estimates at inactive mines. Revisions
    in 2008 were primarily for Mt. Leyshon in Australia and the
    Midnite mine in Washington, USA. Pension settlement losses
    relate to senior management retirements. The Buyat Bay
    settlement relates to legal and other costs incurred in regards
    to pollution allegations at the former Minahasa mine site.

Beginning in 2006, Yanacocha recorded a charge to

Canadian Oil Sands Trust income increased in 2008 due to
    significantly higher oil prices through the majority of 2008.
    Gain on sale of investments, net in 2008 was attributable to the
    sale of marketable equity securities. Interest income decreased
    due to lower investment yields and reduced levels of invested
    funds.

Income from development projects includes gold and copper sales,
    net of incremental operating costs incurred, from de minimis
    production prior to commercial operation. Income from
    development projects included the Awonsu pit in Ahafo in 2008,
    the Bobstar pit in Nevada in 2007 and the Phoenix and Leeville
    operations in Nevada in 2006.

The 2006 loss on ineffective portion of derivative instruments
    includes $56 for the copper collar instruments designated as
    cash flow hedges. Other losses relate to the ineffective portion
    of legacy gold puts held in Australia.

Foreign currency exchange losses in 2008 resulted from the
    strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly in the
    fourth quarter. The Australian dollar exchange rate decreased by
    approximately 22% from December 31, 2007.

Write-down of investments totaled $114, $46, and $nil in 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively, primarily related to the impairment
    of investments in Shore Gold Inc. and Gabriel Resources Ltd. in
    both 2008 and 2007.

In 2006, we settled our remaining obligations under the prepaid
    forward gold sales contract and forward gold purchase contract
    which required delivery of 17,951 ounces of gold in December
    2006 and 179,062 ounces of gold in June 2007. This settlement
    resulted in cash payments of $96, a $48 reduction to the current
    portion of long-term debt and a $40 pre-tax loss on early
    retirement of debt.

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest

was $102,
    $105 and $97 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Capitalized
    interest totaled $47, $50 and $57 in each year, respectively.
    Interest costs decreased in 2008 primarily due to the repayment
    of borrowings at Batu Hijau and Australia, partially offset by
    increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility and a
    full year of interest on the $1,150 convertible senior notes
    issued in July 2007. Interest costs increased in 2007 due to the
    issuance of the $1,150 convertible senior notes and the $200
    bond issuance at Yanacocha in July 2006. These increases were
    partially offset by capitalized interest due to construction of
    Leeville, Phoenix and the power plant in Nevada, the Ahafo
    project in Ghana and the Boddington project in Australia. We
    expect

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest

to
    be approximately $150 to $160 in 2009 due to higher levels of
    debt related to the February 2009 public offering of $518
    convertible senior notes and the adoption of a recent accounting
    pronouncement, FSP APB

14-1,

which
    will increase non-cash interest expense by approximately $55
    (see Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements below).

Income tax expense

was $113 in 2008, compared to $200 and
    $326 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The effective tax rates
    were 9%, (57%), and 26% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Without the $1,122 goodwill impairment charge in 2007 (which is
    not deductible for tax purposes and for which no related income
    tax benefit can be claimed), the effective tax rate for 2007
    would have been 26%. The factors that most significantly
    impacted our effective tax rates for the three periods are
    percentage depletion and resource allowances, the rate
    differential related to foreign earnings indefinitely invested,
    valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, foreign
    earnings net of foreign tax credits, earnings attributable to
    minority interests in subsidiaries and affiliated companies,
    changes in estimates of reserves for income tax uncertainties,
    foreign currency translation gains and losses, impacts of the
    analysis of income taxes payable and U.S. book and tax
    basis of assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, goodwill
    impairment and the impact of certain specific transactions. Many
    of these factors are sensitive to the average realized price of
    gold and other metals.

Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion
    that may exceed our tax basis in our mineral reserves) are
    available to us under the income tax laws of the United States
    for operations conducted in the United States or through
    branches and partnerships owned by U.S. subsidiaries
    included in our consolidated United States income tax return.
    The deductions are highly



sensitive to the price of gold and other minerals produced by
    the Company. For 2006 and prior years, similar types of
    deductions were available for mining operations in Canada. The
    tax benefits from percentage depletion and resource allowances
    were $130, $70 and $77 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    increase in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily is due to the
    increase in gold price.

We operate in various countries around the world that have tax
    laws, tax incentives and tax rates that are significantly
    different than those of the United States. Many of these
    differences combine to move our overall effective tax rate
    higher or lower than the United States statutory rate depending
    on the mix of income relative to income earned in the United
    States. The effect of these differences is shown in Note 8
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements as either a foreign
    rate differential or the effect of foreign earnings, net of
    credits. Differences in tax rates and other foreign income tax
    law variations make our ability to fully utilize all of our
    available foreign income tax credits on a

year-by-year

basis highly dependent on the price of the gold and copper
    produced by the Company and the costs of production, since lower
    prices or higher costs can result in our having insufficient
    sources of taxable income in the United States to utilize all
    available foreign tax credits. Such credits have limited carry
    back and carry forward periods and can only be used to reduce
    the United States income tax imposed on our foreign earnings
    included in our annual United States consolidated income tax
    return. The effects of foreign earnings, net of allowable
    credits, resulted in an increase of income tax expense of $5,
    $10 and $7, in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The effect of
    different income tax rates in countries where earnings are
    indefinitely reinvested contributed to an increase in our income
    tax expense of $20, $7 and $70 in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

The tax effect of changes in local country tax laws, as shown in
    our effective tax reconciliation in Note 8 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, resulted in a net tax benefit
    of $nil, $4 and $71 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    net tax benefit in 2007 is primarily related to a decrease in
    Canadian federal and provincial statutory tax rates and a
    decrease in New Zealand tax rates. The net tax benefit in 2006
    is primarily related to adopting the U.S. dollar as our
    functional currency for Australian tax reporting purposes and a
    decrease in the Canadian federal and provincial statutory tax
    rates.

The need to record valuation allowances related to our deferred
    tax assets (primarily attributable to net operating losses and
    tax credits) is principally dependent on the following factors:
    (i) the extent to which the net operating losses and tax
    credits can be carried back and yield a tax benefit;
    (ii) our long-term estimate of future average realized
    minerals prices; and (iii) the degree to which many of the
    tax laws and income tax agreements that apply to us and our
    subsidiaries around the world tend to create significant tax
    deductions early in the mining process. These up-front
    deductions can give rise to net operating losses and tax credit
    carry forwards in circumstances where future sources of taxable
    income may not coincide with available carry forward periods
    even after taking into account all available tax planning
    strategies. Furthermore, certain liabilities, accrued for
    financial reporting purposes, may not be deductible for tax
    purposes until such liabilities are actually funded which could
    happen after mining operations have ceased, when sufficient
    sources of taxable income may not be available. Changes to
    valuation allowances increased income tax expense by $31, and
    decreased income tax expense by $17 and $3 in 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The change in 2008 primarily is related to
    losses recorded on the decrease in value of certain marketable
    securities investments.

We consolidate certain subsidiaries of which we do not own 100%
    of the outstanding equity. However, for tax purposes, we are
    only responsible for the income taxes on the portion of the
    taxable earnings attributable to our ownership interest of each
    consolidated entity. Such minority interests contributed $19, $4
    and $15 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, as reductions in
    our income tax expense.

In 2008, tax expense decreased by $69 relating to the reduction
    in income taxes resulting from revised estimates of reserves for
    uncertain income tax positions recorded under FIN 48 in
    jurisdictions



where statutes of limitations expired or where uncertain income
    tax positions were considered effectively settled.

Our tax expense decreased by $21, $nil and $1 in 2008, 2007 and
    2006 respectively due to changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates. In 2008, this amount is the U.S. income tax effect
    of realized translation losses attributable to Canadian
    dollar-denominated debt instruments that were converted to
    equity. Because we intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings from
    Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited, no offsetting
    United States deferred income tax effect can be recorded.

During 2008, tax expense decreased by $159 related to
    restructuring the form of one of the Company’s non-US
    subsidiaries. This transaction gave rise to a significant loss
    that will allow the Company to recover income taxes paid in
    prior years.

During 2006 we completed a reconciliation of our U.S. book
    and tax basis assets and liabilities as well as a detailed
    analysis of our income taxes payable. This exercise identified
    differences of $27, which was recognized as a tax benefit in
    2006.

Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the
    factors influencing our effective tax rate and the sensitivity
    of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed
    above, the effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in
    future periods. The effective tax rate is expected to be between
    28% and 32% in 2009.

    Operations). The 2007 increase from 2006 resulted from increased
    earnings at Batu Hijau and a $25 charge in 2007 related to the
    repayment of the carried interest loan at Batu Hijau, partially
    offset by decreased earnings at Yanacocha (see Results of

Discontinued operations include our royalty portfolio and
    Pajingo operation, both sold in 2007, as well as the
    Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture (“Zarafshan”)
    expropriated by the Uzbekistan government in 2006 and the
    Holloway operation and Martabe project, both sold in 2006.

In December 2007, we sold substantially all of Pajingo’s
    assets for cash and marketable equity securities totaling $23
    resulting in a gain of $8. Additional Pajingo asset sales
    resulted in a gain of $1 in 2008.

In June 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan to cease
    Merchant Banking activities. As part of this plan, we decided to
    dispose of the assets recorded in our royalty portfolio and a
    portion of our marketable equity securities portfolio and to
    cease further investments in marketable equity securities that
    do not support our core gold mining business. In June 2007, we
    recorded a $1,665 non-cash charge to impair the goodwill
    associated with the Merchant Banking Segment. In December 2007,
    we received net cash proceeds of $1,187 and recognized a gain of
    $905 related to the sale of the royalty portfolio. In 2008, we
    recognized additional royalty portfolio revenue of $6 in excess
    of our 2007 estimate and recorded a $19 tax benefit related to
    the US tax return

true-up

on
    the sale of the royalty portfolio.

In 2006, we recorded an impairment loss of $101 due to the
    Uzbekistan government’s expropriation of the Zarafshan
    operation. In 2007, after pursuing international arbitration, we
    received proceeds of $80 and recognized a gain of $77 related to
    the settlement.

In 2006, we received $271 net cash proceeds for the Alberta
    oil sands project, resulting in a $266 gain, received
    $42 net cash proceeds and approximately 43 million
    Agincourt shares valued at $37 for the Martabe project,
    resulting in a $30 gain and received $40 net cash proceeds
    plus certain royalties for the Holloway assets, resulting in a
    $13 gain.

Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax

decreased $1,210 in 2008 due to impacts of stock and bond
    market declines, interest rate reductions and the appreciation
    of the



U.S. dollar. The decrease included non-cash adjustments for
    a $573 loss in value of marketable securities, a $387 loss on
    the translation of subsidiaries with non- U.S. dollar
    functional currencies, a $130 net loss related to pension
    liability adjustments and a $120 net loss on derivatives
    designated as cash flow hedges.

Accumulated other
    comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax

increased $284 in
    2007 and included non-cash adjustments for a $113 gain in value
    of marketable securities, a $33 gain related to a pension
    liability adjustment, and a $138 gain on the translation of
    subsidiaries with

non-U.S. dollar

functional currencies.

Accumulated other comprehensive (loss)
    income, net of tax

increased $322 in 2006 and included a

Consolidated gold ounces sold increased in 2008 from 2007 due to:

•

higher production at Yanacocha due to

start-up

of
    milling operations;

•

higher production at Ahafo due to higher ore grades; partially
    offset by

•

lower production at Batu Hijau due to lower ore grades,
    throughput and recovery.

Consolidated gold ounces sold decreased in 2007 from 2006 due to:

•

lower production at Nevada due to lower ore grades;

•

lower production at Yanacocha due to lower ore grade and tons
    placed on the leach pads; partially offset by

•

a full year of operations at Ahafo and Leeville and Phoenix
    (Nevada); and

•

higher production at Batu Hijau due to higher ore grades.



Consolidated copper pounds sold decreased in 2008 from 2007 due
    to the mining sequence resulting in lower ore grades, throughput
    and recovery at Batu Hijau. Consolidated copper pounds sold
    decreased in 2007 from 2006 as a result of an increase in
    concentrate inventory at year-end due to the timing of shipments.

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated gold ounce
    sold increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher diesel,
    royalty and labor costs, partially offset by lower waste removal
    costs at Batu Hijau and higher by-product sales.

Costs
    applicable to sales

per consolidated gold ounce sold
    increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased labor and
    diesel costs, the strengthening of the Australian dollar, a full
    year of operations at Phoenix and Leeville in Nevada and higher
    waste removal costs at Batu Hijau.

Costs applicable to
    sales

per consolidated copper pound increased in 2008
    compared to 2007 due to lower copper production.

Costs
    applicable to sales

per consolidated copper pound increased
    in 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased operating costs.

We expect 2009 consolidated gold sales of approximately 6.35 to
    6.85 million ounces, primarily due to higher production
    from Australia as a result of the

start-up

of
    Boddington and higher production from Batu Hijau as the mining
    sequence shifts to processing higher ore grades and higher
    throughput.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce for 2009
    are expected to be approximately $400 to $440 per ounce as a
    result of lower cost ounces from the

start-up

of
    Boddington (100%), higher expected sales from Yanacocha and Batu
    Hijau production, as well as lower oil price and Australian
    dollar exchange rate assumptions, partially offset by lower
    by-product credits associated with lower copper price
    assumptions. We expect 2009 consolidated copper sales of
    approximately 460 to 510 million pounds at

Costs
    applicable to sales

of approximately $0.65 to $0.75 per
    pound as a result of higher expected sales, processing higher
    grade ore and lower waste removal costs.

Gold ounces sold in Nevada decreased in 2008 from 2007 due to
    the completion of milling at Lone Tree, lower production at Twin
    Creeks and reduced ore processing by third parties experiencing
    operating and financial difficulties, partially offset by higher
    production from Midas, Leeville and leach pads. Open pit ore
    mined decreased to 37.4 million tons in 2008, down from
    42.6 million tons in 2007, due to mine sequencing at Twin
    Creeks and Phoenix. Underground ore mined increased to
    2.5 million tons in 2008, up from 1.9 million tons in
    2007, due to an 80% increase at Leeville. Ore milled decreased
    to 24.8 million tons from 25.5 million tons in 2007,
    while mill ore grade decreased 5% due to processing lower grade
    Twin Creeks stockpiles. Ore placed on leach pads increased to
    19.8 million tons in 2008, up from 14.0 million tons
    in 2007, primarily as a result of mine sequencing at Gold Quarry
    and the

start-up

of
    Bobstar.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased in
    2008 compared to 2007 as lower production, increased diesel and
    other commodity costs, increased underground mining costs,
    higher royalties and taxes were partially offset by the
    completion of higher cost Carlin East mining and Lone Tree
    processing,

start-up

of
    the power plant and higher by-product credits.

Amortization

per ounce increased 18% from 2007 due to more production
    being sourced from Leeville, additional haul trucks at Phoenix
    and the

start-up

of
    the power plant.

Gold ounces sold in Nevada decreased in 2007 from 2006 due to
    the milling of lower grade ore, completion of mining at Lone
    Tree and the temporary suspension of mining operations at Midas,
    partially offset by a full year of operations at Phoenix and
    Leeville. Open pit ore mined increased to 42.6 million tons
    in 2007, up from 38.4 million tons in 2006 and underground
    ore production increased



to 1.9 million tons in 2007 from 1.7 million tons in
    2006 due to a full year of operations at Phoenix and Leeville.
    Ore milled increased to 25.5 million tons from
    17.9 million tons in 2006, while mill ore grade decreased
    23% with the processing of lower grade ore from Phoenix. Ore
    placed on leach pads decreased 37% in 2007 compared to 2006
    primarily as a result of mine sequencing at Gold Quarry and Twin
    Creeks and the completion of mining at Lone Tree in 2006.
    Processing at the Lone Tree mill continued in 2007 with ore
    hauled from Twin Creeks. Nevada’s

Costs applicable to
    sales

per ounce increased in 2007 compared to 2006 as lower
    production, higher cost production from Phoenix, the suspension
    of lower cost mining operations at Midas and increased labor,
    diesel and commodity costs were partially offset by lower
    surface mining costs. Surface mining costs were lower due to
    completion of mining at Lone Tree in 2006 and work on capital
    projects at Carlin, partially offset by a full year of mining at
    Phoenix.

Amortization

per ounce increased 27% from 2006
    as a result of a full year of Phoenix and Leeville operation.

Our Midas operation in Nevada was suspended from June to October
    2007 after a fatal accident. Mining activities

ramped-up

and returned to historic production levels during 2008.

Consolidated gold sales are expected to decline in 2009 to
    approximately 1.8 to 2.0 million ounces, primarily due to
    lower expected ore grades, fewer expected oxide leach pad
    additions, the continued suspension of a third-party operated
    processing facility and lower recoveries at Mill 6 and the
    completion of underground mining activities at Deep Post by the
    end of 2009.

Costs applicable to sales

in 2009 are
    expected to be approximately $535 to $575 per ounce, primarily
    due to lower production and lower by-product credits from
    Phoenix copper sales, partially offset by lower diesel costs and
    a full-year of power provided from our power plant completed in
    mid-2008.

Consolidated gold ounces sold at Yanacocha increased in 2008
    from 2007 due to the

start-up

of
    milling operations, partially offset by lower leach production.
    Ore placed on the leach pads decreased to 97.8 million tons
    in 2008 from 98.3 million tons in 2007 while leach ore
    grades decreased 5% to 0.018 ounces per ton. Gold production
    increased by 16% primarily due to 304,200 ounces from the new
    mill. Start up of the mill occurred in late March and commercial
    production was achieved in the second quarter of 2008.

Costs
    applicable to sales

increased $33 per ounce in 2008 due to
    higher diesel and commodity costs and higher workers
    participation and royalty costs as a result of higher gold
    prices, partially offset by higher gold production and higher
    by-product credits.

Amortization

per ounce decreased 11%
    from 2007 as a result of higher gold production partially offset
    by amortization of the new mill.

Consolidated gold ounces sold at Yanacocha decreased in 2007
    compared to 2006 due to fewer ore tons and lower grade ore
    placed on the leach pads. Ore mined decreased to
    98.6 million tons in 2007 from 115.8 million tons in
    2006. Ore grade decreased by 27% in 2007 compared to 2006 due to
    mine sequencing. The proportion of waste mined increased from
    0.9 to 1.1 waste tons per ton of ore in 2007 compared to 2006 as
    expected in the mine plan.

Costs applicable to sales

increased $152 per ounce in 2007 primarily due to lower
    production, which impacted unit costs by approximately $125 per
    ounce, as well as increased labor, diesel, mine maintenance and
    other costs, partially offset by lower royalties and
    workers’ participation costs.



Consolidated gold sales are expected to increase in 2009 to
    approximately 1.9 to 2.0 million ounces, primarily from a
    full year of mill operation.

Costs applicable to sales

at
    Yanacocha are expected to decrease in 2009 to approximately $290
    to $310 per ounce, primarily due to increased sales, lower
    expected diesel costs and increased silver by-product credits
    from a full year of mill operation.

In 2008, 2007 and 2006, Yanacocha recorded $18, $10 and $22 to

Other expense, net

, respectively, related to an agreement
    with the Peruvian government to provide for a royalty payment
    for community improvements. The negotiated royalty is based on
    3.75% of Yanacocha’s net income beginning January 1,
    2006 for a period of up to five years.

In May 2007, a new Collective Bargaining Agreement expiring in
    February 2010 was completed.

Australia/New Zealand gold ounces sold increased in 2008
    compared to 2007 due to higher production at Jundee and Waihi,
    partially offset by lower production at Tanami.

Costs
    applicable to sales

per ounce increased due to increased
    input costs, particularly diesel, electricity and labor, and
    movements in the Australian dollar exchange rate, partially
    offset by lower administrative costs. During 2008, a portion of
    the Australian and New Zealand dollar denominated operating
    expenditures were hedged which increased

Costs applicable to
    sales

by $14, or $12 per ounce due to the sharp weakness in
    the Australian and New Zealand dollars experienced late in the
    year.

Amortization

per ounce increased 10% due to an
    increase in underground mine development at Tanami, Jundee and
    Waihi.

Australia/New Zealand gold ounces sold decreased slightly in
    2007 compared to 2006 as a result of lower production at
    Kalgoorlie, Jundee and Waihi, partially offset by increased
    inventory sales.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce
    increased due to the strengthening of the Australian and
    New Zealand dollar, which increased

Costs applicable to
    sales

by approximately $40 per ounce, increased royalties
    due to the higher gold price and increased diesel, electricity
    and labor costs.

Consolidated gold sales are expected to increase in 2009 to
    approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million ounces, primarily as a
    result of

start-up

of
    Boddington project (100%) in mid-2009.

Costs applicable to
    sales

are expected to decrease to approximately $440 to $480
    per ounce in 2009, primarily driven by the

start-up

of
    Boddington, lower costs at the Kalgoorlie operation, lower
    diesel price and lower Australian dollar exchange rate
    assumptions.

Jundee, Australia.

Gold ounces sold increased
    in 2008 compared to 2007, due to higher grade and a change in
    the mining sequence resulting in additional high grade ore mined
    from Westside, partially offset by lower mill throughput.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce decreased 15%,
    attributable to higher production and lower milling costs,
    partially offset by higher fuel and power costs, and movements
    in the Australian dollar exchange rate, which increased

Costs
    applicable to sales

by approximately $13 per ounce.



Gold ounces sold decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result
    of lower production, partially offset by inventory sales. Mill
    throughput decreased 26% due to the consolidation of milling
    operations into one plant, partially offset by 28% higher mill
    ore grade.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased
    due to the stronger Australian dollar, which increased

Costs
    applicable to sales

by approximately $42 per ounce, lower
    production, and higher underground mining and power costs.

Tanami, Australia.

Gold ounces sold decreased
    in 2008 from 2007 due to a 15% decrease in mill ore grade.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased 46%, due to
    lower production, higher contracted services costs, higher
    milling costs and movements in the Australian dollar exchange
    rate, which increased

Costs applicable to sales

by
    approximately $20 per ounce.

Gold ounces sold increased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result
    of inventory sales.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce
    increased due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar,
    which increased

Costs applicable to sales

by
    approximately $29 per ounce, increased underground mining and
    milling costs due to being in a deeper part of the mine which
    results in increased backfill activity and fuel and labor costs,
    partially offset by lower royalties.

Kalgoorlie, Australia.

Gold ounces sold
    decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a draw-down of gold
    inventories in 2007, not repeated in 2008.

Costs applicable
    to sales

per ounce increased 29%, due to lower production,
    higher fuel costs, additional leased trucks, higher waste tons
    mined and movements in the Australian dollar exchange rate,
    which increased

Costs applicable to sales

by
    approximately $23 per ounce, partially offset by lower milling
    and administrative costs.

Gold ounces sold decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result
    of a 13% decrease in ore grade milled, partially offset by
    inventory sales.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce
    increased due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar,
    which increased

Costs applicable to sales

by
    approximately $51 per ounce, lower production and higher mining
    costs. Mining costs were higher primarily due to increased sound
    abatement, contract maintenance, drilling, fuel and tire costs.

Waihi, New Zealand.

Gold ounces sold increased
    in 2008 from 2007, due to significantly higher mill throughput
    as mill maintenance was completed in the first quarter of 2007,
    and milling more Favona underground ore partially offset by 12%
    lower mill ore grade.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce
    were 14% lower due to higher production and higher by-product
    credits.

Gold ounces sold decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result
    of the transition to mining the Martha open pit south layback
    and Favona underground in 2007.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of
    the strengthening of the New Zealand dollar which increased

Costs applicable to sales

by approximately $51 per ounce
    and lower production.

Development of the Boddington project remains on schedule and
    was approximately 89% complete as of December 31, 2008 with
    initial mill start up expected in mid-2009. The expected capital
    cost for the project is between $2,600 and $2,900 on a 100%
    basis. In 2007, the Company commenced a hedging program to
    reduce the variability of the Australian denominated capital
    expenditures related to Boddington. As of December 31,
    2008, we have hedged 83% of our 66.67% ownership forecasted
    Australian denominated capital expenditures at Boddington in
    2009.

Consolidated copper pounds and gold ounces sold at Batu Hijau
    decreased in 2008 from 2007 due to lower throughput, ore grade
    and recovery. Batu Hijau experienced heavy rainfall during the
    first quarter of 2008 causing minor damage to pit
    infrastructure, as well as adding significant amounts of water
    to the pit, delaying planned access to higher grade Phase 4 ore
    in the bottom of the pit until late in the third quarter of
    2008. Mill throughput was 19% lower in 2008 compared to 2007 due
    to processing harder ores and blending limitations as a majority
    of 2008 ore was sourced from stockpiles and Phase 5 ore. Ore
    processed during 2008 was lower in grade and contributed to
    lower recovery than ores processed in 2007.

Costs applicable
    to sales

per pound of copper and per ounce of gold increased
    in 2008, compared to 2007, as a result of higher mining costs
    due to increased diesel, labor and milling costs, partially
    offset by lower waste tons mined.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce of gold also increased as a higher co-product
    allocation of costs was made to gold as a result of higher gold
    prices and lower copper prices.

Amortization

per pound of
    copper and ounce of gold increased due to lower production.

Consolidated copper sales decreased slightly in 2007 from 2006,
    due to increased year-end concentrate inventories, partially
    offset by 7% higher production. Consolidated gold sales
    increased in 2007 from 2006 due to 22% higher production,
    partially offset by increased year-end concentrate inventories.
    Increased mill throughput from an improved grinding circuit
    control system was offset by extended mill downtime in the
    fourth quarter of 2007 to repair a damaged mill motor. Copper
    production increased due to a 9% increase in ore grade,
    partially offset by slightly lower recoveries. Gold production
    increased due to a 17% increase in ore grade and a 3% increase
    in recovery. Concentrate inventories increased due to the timing
    of shipments.

Costs applicable to sales

per pound of
    copper and per ounce of gold increased in 2007 compared to 2006
    due to the significant processing of ore from stockpiles and
    higher proportion of waste tons mined. The ratio of waste tons
    to ore tons increased from 1.3 in 2006 to 7.3 in 2007. In 2007,
    most of the mining occurred with Phase 5 waste removal to
    prepare this phase for future production, while 2006 mining
    occurred substantially in Phase 4 ore.

Costs applicable to
    sales

also increased due to higher labor and maintenance
    costs and regional taxes.

The average realized net copper price decreased to $2.59 per
    pound in 2008 from $2.86 per pound in 2007. As of
    December 31, 2008 Batu Hijau had copper sales of
    82 million pounds priced at an average of $1.39 per pound
    subject to final pricing compared to 113 million pounds
    priced at an average of $3.02 per pound at December 31,
    2007. The final copper collar contract deliveries were made in
    February 2007.

Consolidated sales are expected to increase in 2009 to
    approximately 500,000 to 555,000 ounces of gold and
    approximately 460 to 510 million pounds of copper as mining
    shifts into the higher grade Phase 5 ore.

Costs applicable to
    sales

are expected to decrease in 2009 to approximately $240
    to $260 per ounce of gold and approximately $0.65 to $0.75 per
    pound of copper, primarily driven by



higher expected sales, the processing of higher grade ore
    compared to the lower grade stockpiles processed during 2008,
    and lower waste removal.

We currently have a 45% ownership interest in the Batu Hijau
    mine, held through the Nusa Tenggara Partnership
    (“NTP”) with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of
    Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTP and the Sumitomo
    affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTP in turn owns 80% of
    P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”), the
    Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. We identified NTP as
    a VIE as a result of certain capital structures and contractual
    relationships and have fully consolidated NTP in the
    consolidated financial statements since January 1, 2004.
    The remaining 20% interest in PTNNT is owned by
    P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an unrelated
    Indonesian company.

Under the Contract of Work, beginning in 2006 and continuing
    through 2010, a portion of PTNNT’s shares must be offered
    for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or, second, to
    Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between the
    following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned
    by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such
    number is positive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by
    March 31, 2007; 37% by March 31, 2008; 44% by
    March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. The price
    at which such interest must be offered for sale to the
    Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current
    replacement cost, the price at which shares would be accepted
    for listing on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, or the fair market
    value of such interest as a going concern, as agreed with the
    Indonesian government. Pursuant to this provision, it is
    possible that the ownership interest of NTP in PTNNT could be
    reduced to 49%.

PTPI has owned and continues to own a 20% interest in PTNNT, and
    therefore NTP was required to offer a 3% interest in PTNNT for
    sale in 2006 and an additional 7% interest in each of 2007 and
    2008. In accordance with the Contract of Work, an offer to sell
    a 3% interest was made to the Indonesian government in 2006 and
    an offer for an additional 7% interest was made in each of 2007
    and 2008. While the central government declined to participate
    in the 2006 and 2007 offers, local governments in the area in
    which the Batu Hijau mine is located have expressed interest in
    acquiring shares, as have various Indonesian nationals and
    companies. In January 2008, NTP agreed to sell, under a carried
    interest arrangement, 2% of PTNNT’s shares to Kabupaten
    Sumbawa, one of the local governments, subject to satisfaction
    of closing conditions. The Indonesian government subsequently
    stated that it would not approve the transfer of shares under
    this agreement. On February 11, 2008, PTNNT received
    notification from the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources
    (“DEMR”) alleging that PTNNT is in breach of its
    divestiture requirements under the Contract of Work and
    threatening to issue a notice to terminate the Contract of Work
    if PTNNT did not agree to divest the 2006 and 2007 shares,
    in accordance with the direction of the DEMR, by
    February 22, 2008, which date was extended to March 3,
    2008. A second Notice of Default was received relating to the
    alleged failure to divest the 2008 shares. On March 3,
    2008, the Indonesian government filed for international
    arbitration, as did PTNNT, as provided under the Contract of
    Work. In the arbitration proceeding, PTNNT seeks a declaration
    that the Indonesian government is not entitled to terminate the
    Contract of Work and additional declarations pertaining to the
    procedures for divesting the shares. For its part, the
    Indonesian government seeks declarations that PTNNT is in
    default of its divestiture obligations, that the Government may
    terminate the Contract of Work, and that PTNNT must cause shares
    subject to divestiture to be sold to certain local governments.
    An international arbitration panel was appointed and an
    arbitration hearing was held in Jakarta in December 2008. We
    anticipate a ruling will be issued in the first half of 2009.
    Newmont and Sumitomo believe there is no basis under the
    Contract of Work for the notifications and no grounds for
    terminating the Contract of Work, and PTNNT is vigorously
    defending the matter.

In 1997, to enable development of the Batu Hijau mine, PTNNT
    secured an aggregate $1,000 in financing from the United States
    Export-Import Bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation
    (formerly the Japan Export-Import Bank), and Kreditanstalt fur
    Wiederaufbau (the German Export-Import Bank) (collectively, the
    “Senior Lenders”). The Senior Lenders required the
    shareholders of PTNNT to pledge 100% of the shares of PTNNT as
    security for repayment of the loans. As part of



that process, on October 30, 1997, the Minister of Energy
    and Mineral Resources approved the share pledge arrangements.

Subsequent to an additional 7% interest in PTNNT being offered
    by NTP for sale on March 28, 2008 (as required under the
    Contract of Work), the Director General of Mineral, Coal and
    Geothermal Resources at DEMR claimed that PTNNT breached its
    obligations under the Contract of Work by allowing shares to be
    offered for sale that are pledged to the Senior Lenders as
    security for the repayment of the senior debt. In the letter,
    the Director General claimed that NTP would be in default under
    the Contract of Work if the shares of PTNNT offered for sale in
    March 2008, together with the shares offered in 2006 and 2007,
    were not in the possession of “Indonesian government

and/or

government owned entities,” free of any such senior pledge,
    by July 13, 2008. Consequently, on July 10, 2008,
    PTNNT filed a notice to commence an additional international
    arbitration proceeding, as provided for under the Contract of
    Work, to resolve the claim that PTNNT breached its obligations
    under the Contract of Work by allowing shares to be offered that
    are subject to pledge obligations to the Senior Lenders. This
    pledge of shares issue has since been incorporated into, and
    will be resolved as part of the initial arbitration proceeding.

In addition, we have, through PTNNT, been in discussions to
    extend our forest use permit (called a “Pinjam Pakai”)
    for over three years. In 2005, Indonesian governmental
    authorities reviewed the contractual requirements for extension
    of the Pinjam Pakai and determined that PTNNT met those
    requirements. This permit is a key requirement to continue to
    operate Batu Hijau efficiently, in addition to the ultimate life
    of the mine and recoverability of reserves. However, the permit
    extension has not been received as of the date of this Annual
    Report. The resulting delay has adversely impacted Batu Hijau,
    and may adversely impact future operating and financial results,
    including deferment or cancellation of future mine development
    and operations.

For more information on the results of the Batu Hijau
    operations, see Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Gold ounces sold at Ahafo increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due
    to a 25% increase in mill ore grade and higher throughput,
    partially offset by an increase in in-process inventory. Total
    tons mined increased to 50.6 million tons in 2008 from
    44.2 million tons in 2007, due to equipment additions,
    increased mining efficiencies and the operation of a third pit.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased due to
    higher diesel, power, royalties, maintenance and contract
    services costs, partially offset by higher production.

Amortization

per ounce increased due to the use of
    additional equipment and the operation of a third pit.

Gold ounces sold at Ahafo increased in 2007 compared to 2006 as
    a result of a full year of production in 2007.

Costs
    applicable to sales

per ounce increased due to higher mining
    and milling costs. Mining costs increased primarily due to
    higher waste removal in the Apensu pit, higher fuel, pit
    dewatering and maintenance costs. Milling costs increased due to
    higher electricity and maintenance costs.

Costs applicable to
    sales

in 2006 also benefited from the capitalization of
    pre-production costs.

Consolidated gold sales are expected to remain constant at
    approximately 500,000 to 525,000 ounces in 2009.

Costs
    applicable to sales

of approximately $450 to $475 per ounce
    is expected for 2009, primarily as a result of higher labor
    costs, a lower benefit from the capitalization of waste material
    used in the construction of assets, and higher fuel consumption.



During 2007, Newmont and other gold companies with production in
    Ghana, formed a consortium to import power generation equipment
    and constructed an 80 mega-watt power plant. The plant was
    commissioned in 2008 and is ready for transfer to the Volta
    River Authority. As a result of the mining industry’s
    initiative to install the power plant, the Ghanaian government
    has agreed, if required to curtail power consumption as a result
    of power shortages, to distribute power proportionately between
    participating mines and other industrial and commercial
    customers.

Consolidated gold ounces sold includes minority interests’

Gold ounces sold at Other Operations decreased in 2008 from
    2007, primarily due to no sales from Golden Giant, partially
    offset by higher ore placement on the leach pads at
    La Herradura.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce
    increased in 2008 from 2007, primarily due to an $18 (or $205
    per ounce) impairment to net realizable value on leach pads at
    Kori Kollo, additional royalties, higher fuel and leaching costs
    at Kori Kollo as well as increased waste removal and higher fuel
    costs at La Herradura.

Gold ounces sold at Other Operations decreased in 2007 from
    2006, primarily due to the completion of operations at Golden
    Giant and lower production from Kori Kollo. Gold production from
    Kori Kollo decreased due to lower recovery from the leach pads.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased in 2007
    from 2006, primarily due to lower production and higher waste
    removal costs at La Herradura and the completion of
    operations at Golden Giant.

Consolidated gold sales for Other Operations in 2009 are
    expected to be approximately 150,000 to 170,000 ounces at

Costs applicable to sales

of approximately $465 to $480
    per ounce.

Exploration

Exploration expense was $214, $177 and $166 for 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Exploration expense in 2008 reflects
    increased activity in response to higher gold prices and
    increased drilling, labor and consumable costs. We anticipate
    spending between $165 and $175 on exploration activities in 2009
    due to a reduced drilling program related to the Company’s
    focus on net cash flow generation and a more selective and
    strategic exploration program.

During 2008, we added 5.2 million equity ounces to proven
    and probable reserves, with 6.7 million equity ounces of
    depletion. Reserve additions from exploration of
    4.4 million equity ounces were primarily due to conversion
    of mineralized material at Boddington (1.6 million equity
    ounces, 66.67%), with most of the remaining additions coming
    from several open pit and underground sites in Nevada (totaling
    1.2 million equity ounces) and from underground sites in
    Australia (0.7 million equity ounces). Gold reserves were
    revised down by 1.1 million equity ounces, primarily due to
    metallurgy, geology and modeling impacts at Phoenix in Nevada.
    The impact of the change in gold price assumption on reserve
    additions was an increase of 1.9 million equity ounces.



During 2007, reserve additions from exploration of
    3.5 million equity ounces were primarily due to further
    extension drilling at Boddington (66.67%), Jundee and Tanami in
    Australia (2.6 million equity ounces), with the remaining
    additions from several open pit and underground sites in Nevada
    as well as La Herradura in Mexico. We added a total of
    0.8 million equity gold ounces to proven and probable
    reserves in 2007.

Exploration activities during 2006 succeeded in converting
    significant new reserves at Carlin open pits (2.3 million
    equity gold ounces), Boddington (1.4 million equity gold
    ounces, 66.67%), Twin Creeks (1.1 million equity gold
    ounces), Ahafo (0.7 million equity gold ounces),
    La Herradura (0.7 million equity gold ounces), and
    Kalgoorlie (0.6 million equity gold ounces). We added a
    total of 5.9 million equity gold ounces to proven and
    probable reserves in 2006.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rates

In addition to its domestic operations in the United States, we
    have operations in Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Indonesia,
    Ghana, Canada, Bolivia and other foreign locations. Our
    operations sell their production based on U.S. dollar metal
    prices.

Fluctuations in local currency exchange rates in relation to the
    U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and

Costs applicable to sales

to the extent costs are paid in
    local currency at foreign operations. Such fluctuations have not
    had a material impact on our revenue since gold and copper are
    sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars.
    Approximately 28%, 28% and 33% of our

Costs applicable to
    sales

were paid in local currencies in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Our

Costs applicable to sales

are most
    significantly impacted by variations in the Australian
    dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. However, variations in
    the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate
    historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the
    U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or
    decreases in costs at Australian locations due to exchange rate
    changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in
    sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations. No
    assurance, however, can be given that the Australian
    dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be
    strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the
    future.

Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to
    the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations increased

Costs applicable to sales

$13 in 2008 from 2007, and $51
    in 2007 from 2006, primarily by movements in the Australian
    dollar.

In 2007, we implemented derivative programs to hedge up to 75%
    of our future forecasted Australian dollar denominated operating
    and capital expenditures to reduce the variability in our
    Australian dollar denominated expenditures. As of
    December 31, 2008, we have hedged 66%, 38% and 12% of our
    forecasted Australian denominated operating costs in 2009, 2010
    and 2011, respectively, at an average rate of 0.79, 0.78 and
    0.74, respectively. We have also hedged 83% of our 66.67%
    ownership forecasted Australian denominated capital expenditures
    at Boddington in 2009 at an average rate of 0.79.

Foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the
    U.S. dollar have not had a material impact on our
    determination of proven and probable reserves in the past.
    However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in
    relation to the Australian dollar,

and/or

to
    other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were
    not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar
    gold price or by other factors, the amount of proven and
    probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be
    reduced as certain proven and probable reserves may no longer be
    economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on
    a variety of factors including the length of time of any such
    weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management’s
    long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. Future
    reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily
    result in reduced gold or copper sales and increased
    amortization and, depending on the level of reduction, could
    also result in impairments of property, plant and mine
    development, mineral interests

and/or

goodwill.



Recently Issued
    Accounting Pronouncements

Post-Retirement
    Benefit Plan

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP
    No. FAS 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures
    about Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Assets” (“FSP
    FAS 132(R)-1”), which amends FASB Statement
    No. 132 “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions
    and Other Post-Retirement Benefits”
    (“FAS 132”), to provide guidance on an
    employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined
    benefit pension or other post-retirement plan. The objective of
    FSP FAS 132(R)-1 is to require more detailed disclosures
    about employers’ plan assets, including employers’
    investment strategies, major categories of plan assets,
    concentrations of risk within plan assets, and valuation
    techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets. FSP
    FAS 132(R)-1 is effective for our fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2009. Upon initial application, the provisions
    of this FSP are not required for earlier periods that are
    presented for comparative purposes. We are currently evaluating
    the potential impact of adopting this statement on our defined
    benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plan disclosures.

Equity Method
    Investment

In November 2008, the EITF reached consensus on Issue

No. 08-6,

“Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations”

(“EITF 08-6”),

which clarifies the accounting for certain transactions and
    impairment considerations involving equity method investments.
    The intent of

EITF 08-6

is to provide guidance on (i) determining the initial
    carrying value of an equity method investment,
    (ii) performing an impairment assessment of an underlying
    indefinite-lived intangible asset of an equity method
    investment, (iii) accounting for an equity method
    investee’s issuance of shares, and (iv) accounting for
    a change in an investment from the equity method to the cost
    method.

EITF 08-6

is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009
    and is to be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating
    the potential impact of adopting this statement on our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Equity-Linked
    Financial Instruments

In June 2008, the EITF reached consensus on Issue

No. 07-5,

“Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is
    Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock”

(“EITF 07-5”).

EITF 07-5

clarifies the determination of whether an instrument (or an
    embedded feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock,
    which would qualify as a scope exception under FASB Statement
    No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities” (“FAS 133”).

EITF 07-5

is effective for our fiscal years beginning January 1,
    2009. Early adoption for an existing instrument is not
    permitted. We do not expect the adoption of

EITF 07-5

to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position
    or results of operations.

Accounting for
    Convertible Debt Instruments

In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. APB

14-1,

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement)” (“FSP APB

14-1”).

FSP APB

14-1

applies to convertible debt instruments that, by their stated
    terms, may be settled in cash (or other assets) upon conversion,
    including partial cash settlement, unless the embedded
    conversion option is required to be separately accounted for as
    a derivative under FAS 133. Convertible debt instruments
    within the scope of FSP APB

14-1

are not
    addressed by the existing APB 14. FSP APB

14-1

requires that the liability and equity components of convertible
    debt instruments within the scope of FSP APB

14-1

be
    separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the
    entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. This requires
    an allocation of the convertible debt proceeds between the
    liability component and the embedded conversion option (i.e.,
    the equity component). The difference between the principal
    amount of the debt and the amount of the proceeds allocated to
    the liability component will be reported as a debt discount and
    subsequently amortized to earnings over the instrument’s
    expected life using the effective interest method. FSP APB

14-1

is
    effective for our



fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and will be applied
    retrospectively to all periods presented. We estimate that
    approximately $301 of debt discount will be recorded and the
    effective interest rate on our 2014 and 2017 convertible senior
    notes (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements) will increase by approximately 5 percentage
    points to 6.0% and 6.25%, respectively, for the non-cash
    amortization of the debt discount. If FSP APB

14-1

had
    been effective when the convertible debt instruments were
    issued,

Net income

would have been $21 ($0.05 per share)
    lower in 2008 and

Net loss

would have been $9 ($0.02 per
    share) higher in 2007.

Accounting for
    the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets”

(“FSP 142-3”)

which amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement
    No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
    (“FAS 142”). The intent of this FSP is to improve
    the consistency between the useful life of a recognized
    intangible asset under FAS 142 and the period of expected
    cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under
    FASB Statement No. 141, “Business Combinations”
    (“FAS 141”).

FSP 142-3

is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009
    and will be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired
    after the effective date. We do not expect the adoption of

FSP 142-3

to have an impact on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Derivative
    Instruments

In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161,
    “Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133” (“FAS 161”) which provides
    revised guidance for enhanced disclosures about how and why an
    entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments
    and the related hedged items are accounted for under
    FAS 133, and how derivative instruments and the related
    hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance and cash flows. FAS 161 is effective
    for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. We are
    currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this
    statement on our derivative instrument disclosures.

Business
    Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement
    No. 141(R), “Business Combinations”
    (“FAS 141(R)”) which amends FAS 141, and
    provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring
    identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed,
    and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. It also
    provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the
    financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
    effects of the business combination. FAS 141(R) is
    effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and
    is to be applied prospectively. This statement will impact how
    we account for future business combinations and our future
    consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“FAS 160”) which establishes accounting and
    reporting standards pertaining to (i) ownership interests
    in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent,
    (ii) the amount of net income attributable to the parent
    and to the noncontrolling interest, (iii) changes in a
    parent’s ownership interest, and (iv) the valuation of
    any retained noncontrolling equity investment when a subsidiary
    is deconsolidated. For presentation and disclosure purposes,
    FAS 160 requires noncontrolling interests to be classified
    as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
    FAS 160 is effective for our fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2009.

    and increased gold sales volume, partially offset by lower
    realized copper prices and lower copper sales volume, as
    discussed above in

Consolidated Financial Results

, and
    $354 invested in inventories, stockpiles (primarily at Batu
    Hijau) and ore on leach pads, $198 invested in prepaid taxes and
    $104 to fund reclamation activities. The 2007 results were
    negatively impacted by the $578 settlement of the price-capped
    forward sales contracts, $276 payment of pre-acquisition
    Australia income taxes of Normandy and $174 from the final
    settlement of copper collar contracts.

We are currently planning to contribute $48 to our retirement
    benefit programs in 2009 to bolster plan assets which were
    impacted by the sharp decline in values in 2008. For additional
    discussion see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities of continuing
    operations

was $2,151, $2,467 and $1,142 in 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively.

Additions to property, plant and mine development

were
    $1,875, $1,672 and $1,537 for continuing operations in 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

Capital expenditures in Nevada during 2008 included $40 for
    completion of the power plant, $73 for surface and underground
    development, $55 for tailings dams and $19 for mine equipment.
    Yanacocha capital expenditures included $35 for completion of
    the gold mill, $61 for leach pad expansions and $34 for the
    Conga project. Capital expenditures in Australia/New Zealand
    included $833 for continued construction of the Boddington
    project and $59 for underground mine development. In 2007, we
    commenced a hedging program to reduce the variability of the
    Australian denominated capital expenditures related to
    Boddington. As of December 31, 2008, we have hedged 83% of
    our remaining forecasted Australian dollar denominated capital
    expenditures in 2009 for our 66.67% ownership at an average rate
    of 0.79. Batu Hijau’s capital expenditures included $42 for
    a tailings pipeline, $16 for mine equipment purchases and $14
    for mine dewatering. Capital expenditures in Africa included $34
    for surface development, $28 for mine equipment purchases and
    $22 for infrastructure and land. Hope Bay expenditures included
    $79 for project infrastructure.

Capital expenditures in Nevada during 2007 included $280 for the
    power plant and $160 for mine equipment replacement. Yanacocha
    capital expenditures included $139 for construction of the gold
    mill, $39 for leach pad expansions and $12 for the Conga
    project. Capital expenditures in Australia/New Zealand included
    $468 for construction of the Boddington project, $63 for
    underground mine development and $27 for tailings dams
    construction. Batu Hijau’s capital expenditures included
    $38 for mine equipment purchases and $17 for mine dewatering.
    Capital expenditures in Africa included $20 at Akyem and $14 for
    power generation facilities, $21 for a cyanide recovery circuit,
    $28 for mine equipment and $12 for infrastructure and land at
    Ahafo.



Capital expenditures in Nevada during 2006 included $239 for the
    power plant, $160 for surface mining equipment, $104 for the
    development of the Leeville underground mine, $87 for the
    development of the Phoenix project, and $54 for tailings dams
    and leach pads. Yanacocha capital expenditures included $113 for
    development and leach pad expansions, $44 for the gold mill
    project, $43 for mine maintenance and services, and $11 for the
    Conga project. Australian capital expenditures included $93 for
    the Boddington project and $71 for mine development.
    Expenditures at Batu Hijau included $67 for the purchase of
    additional mining equipment and $20 for process improvements and
    replacement of the tailings line. Capital expenditures in Africa
    included $117 for project completion and $24 for mining
    equipment at Ahafo and $57 for engineering and procurement
    expenditures for process facilities and other pre-construction
    activities at Akyem. Corporate expenditures primarily included
    information technology systems.

During 2008, 2007 and 2006, $18, $19 and $21, respectively, of
    drilling and related costs were capitalized and included in mine
    development costs. These capitalized costs included $10 at
    Australia, $6 at Nevada and $2 at La Herradura in 2008; $11
    at Australia, $4 at Nevada, $2 at La Herradura and $1 at
    Africa and Yanacocha in 2007; and $10 at Australia, $7 at
    Nevada, $3 at Africa, and $1 at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau in 2006.

During 2008, 2007 and 2006, $27, $16 and $48, respectively, of
    pre-stripping costs were capitalized and included in mine
    development costs. Pre-stripping costs included the Bobstar pit
    and North Lantern pit in Nevada and the Awonsu and Amoma pits at
    Ahafo in 2008, the Bobstar pit in Nevada in 2007 and the Phoenix
    mine in Nevada, the Chaquicocha mine at Yanacocha, and the
    Subika and Apensu pits at Ahafo in 2006.

We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1,400 to
    $1,600 in 2009, with approximately 60% in Australia/New Zealand,
    15% in Nevada and the remaining 25% at other locations.
    Approximately 45% of the 2009 capital budget is allocated to
    sustaining investments, with the remaining 55% allocated to
    project development initiatives, including completion of the
    Boddington project (100%) in Australia.

Investments in marketable debt and equity securities,
    net.

We had net proceeds of $nil, $2 and $774 in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, from auction rate marketable
    debt securities. The auction rate marketable debt securities in
    which we have invested have not traded in an active market since
    August 2007 and there are currently no market quotations
    available. The investment carries a BBB rating from both
    Standard and Poor’s and Fitch’s. As of
    December 31, 2008, approximately $7 of such securities,
    with accumulated unrealized losses of approximately $2, are
    classified as long-term marketable debt securities as a result
    of current auction market conditions and our expectation of
    holding such investments to maturity or recovery which is likely
    longer than one year. Similarly, we anticipate holding our
    marketable debt securities investment in asset backed commercial
    paper, which we obtained through the acquisition of Miramar, to
    maturity or recovery which is likely longer than one year.

During 2008, we purchased marketable equity securities of
    Gabriel Resources for $11 and other marketable equity securities
    for $6 and we received cash of $50 for the sale of marketable
    equity securities. During 2007, we purchased marketable equity
    securities of Gabriel Resources for $27 and other marketable
    equity securities for $9. During 2006, we purchased marketable
    equity securities of Gabriel Resources for $17 and Queenstake
    Resources for $10. We also reinvested dividends from Canadian
    Oil Sands Trust for $26.

Acquisitions.

During the last quarter of 2007
    and the first quarter of 2008, we paid $953 and $318,
    respectively, to acquire the remaining outstanding common shares
    of Miramar, resulting in Miramar becoming a wholly-owned
    subsidiary. As a result of the completed acquisition of Miramar,
    we control the Hope Bay project, a large undeveloped gold
    property in Nunavut, Canada. In April 2008, we purchased
    additional shares of EGR for $7, net of cash acquired, bringing
    our ownership interest to 56.67% from 46.72%. In November 2008,
    EGR repurchased 6.55% of its own shares from a minority
    shareholder bringing our ownership to 60.64%.



In September 2006, we acquired a 40% interest in Shore Gold
    Inc.’s Fort a la Corne JV diamond project in
    Saskatchewan, Canada.

In March 2006, we acquired Newcrest Mining Limited’s 22.22%
    interest in the Boddington project, bringing our interest in the
    project to 66.67%, for total consideration of $173.

In January 2006, we acquired the remaining 15% interest in the
    Akyem project in Ghana for $23, bringing our interest to 100%.
    Development studies on Akyem continued through 2008. A
    development decision is pending resolution of power availability
    in Ghana and further project optimization. We are advancing
    towards a development decision in 2010 based on Ghana’s
    proactive stance towards power development.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash provided from (used in) financing activities of
    continuing operations

was $123 in 2008, compared to $465 and
    $(333) in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Proceeds from debt, net.

During 2008, we
    received net proceeds of $757 under our $2,000 revolving credit
    facility compared to net proceeds of $nil in 2007 and 2006. The
    facility is also used for the issuance of letters of credit
    totaling $519 as of December 31, 2008, primarily supporting
    reclamation obligations (see

“Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements”

below). We also had proceeds of $75 in
    December at Ahafo from an International Finance Corporation loan.

During July 2007, we completed a private offering of $1,150
    convertible senior notes due 2014 and 2017, each in the amount
    of $575. The 2014 notes, maturing on July 15, 2014, pay
    interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.25% per annum, and the
    2017 notes, maturing on July 15, 2017, pay interest
    semi-annually at a rate of 1.625% per annum. The notes will be
    convertible, at the holder’s option, at a conversion price
    of $46.21 per share of common stock. Upon conversion, the
    principle amount and all accrued interest will be repaid in cash
    and any conversion premium will be settled in shares of our
    common stock or, at our election, cash or any combination of
    cash and shares of our common stock. We are not entitled to
    redeem the notes prior to their stated maturity dates. The net
    proceeds from the offering, after expenses, were approximately
    $1,126. We used the net proceeds of the offering to (i) pay
    the net cost of convertible note hedge and warrant transactions
    that we entered into with affiliates of some of the initial
    purchasers, (ii) repay outstanding indebtedness under our
    senior revolving credit facility, (iii) net settle our
    price-capped forward sales contracts, (iv) fund capital
    expenditures for Boddington and the power plant in Nevada and
    (v) fund other general corporate purposes.

In connection with the convertible senior notes offering, we
    entered into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant
    transactions (“Call Spread Transactions”). These
    transactions included the purchase of call options and the sale
    of warrants. As a result of the Call Spread Transactions, the
    conversion price of $46.21 was effectively increased to $60.27.
    Our aggregate cost of the purchased call options was $366,
    partially offset by $248 that we received from the sale of the
    warrants.

In July 2006, Yanacocha issued $100 of bonds in the Peruvian
    capital markets under a $200 bond program approved by the
    Peruvian securities regulatory authority. The bonds are
    comprised of $42 of floating interest rate bonds bearing
    interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.4375%; and $58 of fixed rate
    bonds bearing interest at 7.0%. The bonds have a four year grace
    repayment period and amortize quarterly over six years. The
    bonds are uncollateralized and are non-recourse to us. Funds
    generated from the bond issuance were used by Yanacocha
    primarily for capital expenditures.

In May 2006, Yanacocha entered into an uncollateralized $100
    bank financing with a syndicate of Peruvian commercial banks.
    Quarterly repayments began May 2007 with final maturity May
    2014. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate of
    LIBOR plus 1.875%. The loan is uncollateralized and non-recourse
    to us.



Repayment of debt.

During 2008, we made
    scheduled debt repayments of $119 on maturity of the Australia


/


% notes,
    $22 related to the sale-leaseback of the refractory ore
    treatment plant, classified as a capital lease, $87 related to
    Batu Hijau project financing, $14 on the Yanacocha credit
    facility and $11 on Yanacocha capital leases. Scheduled minimum
    debt repayments are $169 in 2009, $156 in 2010, $329 in 2011,
    $901 in 2012, $115 in 2013 and $1,872 thereafter.

Dividends paid to minority interests.

We paid
    dividends of $389, $270 and $264 to minority interests during
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Dividends paid to common stockholders.

We paid
    annual dividends of $0.40 per common share during 2008, 2007 and
    2006. Additionally, Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada
    Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, paid annual dividends of
    C$0.43, C$0.43 and C$0.46 during 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. On February 18, 2009, we declared a regular
    quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, payable March 27,
    2009 to holders of record at the close of business on
    March 6, 2009. The total paid to common stockholders was
    $182, $181 and $180 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Proceeds from stock issuance.

We received
    proceeds of $29, $51 and $78 during 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, from the issuance of common stock related to the
    exercise of stock options.

Early extinguishment of prepaid forward sales
    obligation.

In September 2006, we settled our
    remaining obligations under the prepaid forward gold sales
    contract and forward gold purchase contract for which we were
    required to deliver gold in December 2006 and June 2007. This
    settlement resulted in cash payments of approximately $96 and a
    $48 reduction to the current portion of long-term debt.

Discontinued
    Operations

Net operating cash (used in) provided from discontinued
    operations

was $(111) in 2008, compared to $138 and $96 in

    operations

was $nil in 2008 and 2007 and $7 in 2006 from the
    repayment of debt at Zarafshan.

Corporate
    Revolving Credit Facility

The Company has an uncollateralized $2,000 revolving credit
    facility with a syndicate of commercial banks, which matures in
    April 2012. The facility contains a letter of credit
    sub-facility. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the
    credit ratings of the Company’s senior, uncollateralized,
    long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest at
    an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.28% or the
    lead bank’s prime interest rate. Facility fees accrue at an
    annual rate of 0.07% of the aggregate commitments. The Company
    also pays a utilization fee of 0.05% on the amount of revolving
    credit loans and letters of credit outstanding under the
    facility for each day on which the sum of such loans and letters
    of credit exceed 50% of the commitments under the facility. As
    of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the facility fees were 0.07%
    of the commitment. There was $519 and $440 outstanding under the
    letter of credit sub-facility as of December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. As of December 31, 2008 we had $724 of
    the credit facility borrowings available.

Debt
    Covenants

The


/


% notes,


/


% debentures,
    and sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant debt
    facilities contain various covenants and default provisions
    including payment defaults, limitation on liens, limitation on
    sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions.

The Ahafo project facility contains a financial ratio covenant
    requiring us to maintain a net debt to EBITDA (earnings before
    interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization)
    ratio of less than or equal to 4.0 and a net debt (total debt
    net of cash and cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio
    of less than or equal to 62.5%.

In addition to the covenants noted above, the corporate
    revolving credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant
    requiring us to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and
    cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less than or
    equal to 62.5%. Furthermore, the corporate revolving credit
    facility contains covenants limiting the sale of all or
    substantially all of our assets, certain change of control
    provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets.

Certain of our project debt facilities contain debt covenants
    and default provisions including limitations on dividends
    subject to certain debt service cover ratios, limitations on
    sales of assets, negative pledges on certain assets, restricted
    payments to partners, change of control provisions and
    limitations of additional permitted debt.

As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all
    debt covenants and provisions related to potential defaults.

Shelf
    Registration Statement

In October 2007, we filed with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission a shelf registration statement on

Form S-3

which enables the Company to issue an indeterminate number or
    amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities,
    guarantees of debt securities and warrants from time to time at
    indeterminate prices. It also included the resale of an
    indeterminate amount of common



stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time to time
    upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible
    securities.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We have the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating
    leases (as disclosed in the above table) and $778 of outstanding
    letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees (see
    Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We also
    provide a contingent support line of credit to PTNNT of which
    our pro rata share is $37. In 2008, $23 was provided under this
    contingent support agreement.



Batu Hijau has sales agreements to sell copper concentrates at
    market prices as follows (in thousands of tons) 803 in 2009; 823
    in 2010; 670 in 2011, 651 in 2012, 639 in 2013 and 231
    thereafter. For information regarding these copper sales
    agreements, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures about Market Risk-Hedging, Provisional Copper and
    Gold Sales, below.

Future Cash
    Flows

We anticipate that significant capital expenditures in future
    years (see Investing Activities, above), funding of exploration
    and advanced projects, debt repayments and dividends to both
    common shareholders and minority interests is expected to lead
    to

Net cash used in investing activities

and

Net cash
    used in financing activities

exceeding

Net cash provided
    by operating activities

. Our ability to raise and service
    significant new sources of capital will be a function of
    macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices as well
    as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt
    position, among other factors. In light of the currently limited
    global availability of credit, and given our existing debt
    position, we may determine that it may be necessary or
    preferable to issue additional equity or other securities, defer
    projects or sell assets. Additional financing may not be
    available when needed or, if available, the terms of such
    financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering
    equity securities, may involve substantial dilution to existing
    stockholders. In the event of lower gold and copper prices,
    unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding
    limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities,
    invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business
    activities, retire or service all outstanding debt and pay
    dividends could be significantly constrained. For information on
    our long-term debt, capital lease obligations and operating
    leases, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

On February 3, 2009, we completed a public offering of $518
    convertible senior notes, including notes offered to cover
    over-allotments, maturing on February 15, 2012 for net
    proceeds of $504 after deducting the underwriters discount and
    estimated expenses of the offering. The notes will pay interest
    semi-annually at a rate of 3.00% per annum. The notes are
    convertible, at the holder’s option, equivalent to a
    conversion price of $46.25 per share of common stock.

On February 3, 2009, we completed a public offering of
    34,500,000 shares of common stock, including shares offered
    to cover over-allotments, at a price of $37.00, for net proceeds
    of $1,233 after deducting the underwriters discount and
    estimated expenses of the offering. Such offerings were made
    pursuant to our automatic shelf registration statement on

Form S-3.

See Shelf Registration Statement above.

The following table represents our pro-forma capitalization
    assuming the completion of the public offerings of the
    convertible senior notes and common stock noted above as well as
    the impact of the adoption of FSP APB

14-1.

FSP
    APB

14-1

applies to convertible debt instruments and requires that the
    liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments
    within the scope be separately accounted for in a manner that
    reflects the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate.
    This requires an allocation of the convertible debt proceeds
    between the liability component and the embedded conversion
    option (i.e., the equity component). The difference between the
    principal amount of the debt and the amount of the proceeds
    allocated to the liability component will be reported as a debt
    discount and subsequently amortized to earnings over the
    instrument’s expected life using the



effective interest method. FSP APB

14-1

is
    effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and
    will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.

Cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the
    realized spot price of gold and copper. For information on the
    sensitivity of our

Net cash provided by operating activities

to metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in
    foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the
    U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Australian
    and New Zealand dollars. Accordingly, we have entered into
    derivative instruments to reduce the volatility of

Costs
    applicable to sales

in Australia/New Zealand. For
    information concerning the sensitivity of our

Costs
    applicable to sales

to changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates, see Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency
    Exchange Rates, above. For information on the sensitivity of our

Net cash provided from operating activities

to foreign
    currency exchange rates, see Item 7A, Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Net cash provided
    from operating activities

will also be impacted in 2009 as a
    result of planned contributions of $48 for our post-retirement
    benefit programs.

Based on our production profile as of December 31, 2008, we
    expect that consolidated gold ounces sold will be between 6.35
    and 6.85 million ounces in 2009. We do not anticipate that
    reasonably expected variations in gold or copper sales alone
    will influence our ability to pay our debt and other obligations
    in 2009.

Environmental

Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various
    federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection
    of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually
    changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. We conduct
    our operations so as to protect the public health and
    environment and believe our operations are in compliance with
    applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. We
    have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to
    comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the
    full amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future
    reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory
    requirements. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, $617 and
    $569, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating
    to



currently or recently producing mineral properties, of which $49
    is classified as current liabilities expected to be spent in
    2009.

In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning
    environmental obligations associated with former mining
    activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and
    implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. We
    believe that the related environmental obligations associated
    with these sites are similar in nature with respect to the
    development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the
    compliance required to meet general environmental standards.
    Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters,
    $163 and $125 were accrued for such obligations as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Depending upon
    the ultimate resolution of these matters, we believe that it is
    reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could
    be as much as 126% greater or 7% lower than the amount accrued
    as of December 31, 2008. The amounts accrued for these
    matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and
    circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are
    charged to

Other expense, net

in the period estimates are
    revised.

We spent $39, $13 and $12 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
    for environmental obligations related to former, primarily
    historic, mining activities, and have classified $15 as a
    current liability expected to be spent in 2009. Expenditures for
    2008 related primarily to Resurrection, a mine site in
    Leadville, Colorado as well as the Mt. Leyshon property in
    Australia which is a legacy Normandy site. Expenditures for 2007
    and 2006 related primarily to legacy Normandy properties in
    Australia, the McCoy/Cove property in Nevada and the Dawn mill
    site.

Included in capital expenditures were $231, $90 and $124 in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to comply with environmental
    regulations. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental
    regulations have not been a significant component of

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (dollars in
    millions except per share, per ounce and per pound
    amounts)

Metal
    Price

Changes in the market price of gold and copper significantly
    affect our profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can
    fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand;
    forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and
    lending; investor sentiment; the relative strength of the
    U.S. dollar and global mine production levels. Copper is
    traded on established international exchanges and copper prices
    generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be
    influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by
    currency exchange rates.

Foreign
    Currency

Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to
    the U.S. dollar may affect our profitability and cash flow.
    Foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to
    numerous



factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and
    U.S. currencies and U.S. and foreign country economic
    conditions. In addition to its operations in the United States,
    we have assets or operations in Australia, Peru, Indonesia,
    Canada, Bolivia, New Zealand, Ghana and Mexico. Our

non-U.S. operations

sell their metal production based on a U.S. dollar gold
    price. Fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in
    relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit
    margins and

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce to the
    extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations.
    The Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate has had the
    greatest impact on our

Costs applicable to sales

, as
    measured in U.S. dollars. However, variations in the
    Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate have
    historically been strongly correlated to variations in the
    U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or
    decreases in costs at Australian gold operations due to exchange
    rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in
    sales reported in U.S. dollars for such locations. No
    assurance can be given that the Australian
    dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be
    strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the
    future, or that short-term changes in the Australian
    dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will not have an impact on
    our profitability and cash flow. Foreign currency exchange rates
    in relation to the U.S. dollar have not had a material
    impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves in
    the past. However, if a sustained weakening of the
    U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar,

and/or

to
    other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were
    not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar
    gold price or by other factors, profitability, cash flows and
    the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable
    foreign country could be reduced. The extent of any such
    reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including
    the length of time of any such weakening of the
    U.S. dollar, and management’s long-term view of the
    applicable exchange rate. For information concerning the
    sensitivity of our

Costs applicable to sales

to changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7,
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated
    Results of Operations and Financial Condition-Results of
    Consolidated Operations-Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above.

Hedging

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes
    in the gold price by selling our gold production at market
    prices. Prior to 2007, however, we entered into derivative
    contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated
    gold and copper production. During 2007, we delivered into the
    last of the copper collar contracts and settled all price-capped
    forward gold sales contracts. We continue to manage risks
    associated with commodity inputs, interest rates and foreign
    currencies using the derivative market.

By using derivatives, we are affected by credit risk, market
    risk and market liquidity risk. Credit risk is the risk that a
    third party might fail to fulfill its performance obligations
    under the terms of a financial instrument. We mitigate credit
    risk by entering into derivatives with high credit quality
    counterparties, limiting the amount of exposure to each
    counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of the
    counterparties. Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a
    derivative might be adversely affected by a change in underlying
    commodity prices, interest rates, or currency exchange rates,
    and that this in turn affects our financial condition. We manage
    market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit
    the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. We
    mitigate this risk by establishing trading agreements with
    counterparties under which we are not required to post any
    collateral or make any margin calls on our derivatives. Our
    counterparties cannot require settlement solely because of an
    adverse change in the fair value of a derivative. Market
    liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative cannot be
    eliminated quickly, by either liquidating it or by establishing
    an offsetting position. Under the terms of our trading
    agreements, counterparties cannot require us to immediately
    settle outstanding derivatives, except upon the occurrence of
    customary events of default such as covenant breeches, including
    financial covenants, insolvency or bankruptcy. We generally
    mitigate market liquidity risk by spreading out the maturity of
    our derivatives over time.

During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we entered into IDR/$ forward
    purchase contracts to hedge a portion of our IDR/$ operating
    expenditure exposure. In 2008 and 2007, we entered into $/A$
    forward



purchase contracts in Australia/New Zealand to hedge a portion
    of our A$ operating expenditure exposure and our A$ capital
    expenditure exposure related to the construction of the
    Boddington project. In 2008, we entered into a layered fixed
    forward contract program to hedge a portion of our NZ$
    denominated operating expenditures. Also in 2008, we implemented
    a program to hedge a portion of our cost exposure related to
    diesel prices of fuel consumed in our Nevada operations. All of
    the currency and diesel contracts have been designated as cash
    flow hedges of future expenditures, and as such, changes in the
    market value have been recorded in

Accumulated other
    comprehensive (loss) income

. During 2006, we entered into
    copper collar contracts to hedge the copper price realized
    during those periods. Final delivery under the copper collar
    contracts occurred in February 2007. As of December 31,
    2006, approximately 13 million pounds of copper were hedged
    by the copper collar contracts, which had been designated as
    cash flow hedges of forecasted copper sales, and as such,
    changes in the fair value related to the effective portion of
    the hedges were recorded in

Accumulated other comprehensive
    (loss) income

.

For 2008, 2007 and 2006, net gains (losses) of $10, $4 and
    $(60), respectively, were included in

,

net of tax

to income for derivative
    instruments during the next 12 months is a loss of
    approximately $33. The maximum period over which hedged
    forecasted transactions are expected to occur is 3 years.

Foreign
    Currency Contracts

We entered into a series of foreign currency contracts to hedge
    the variability of the US dollar amount of forecasted foreign
    currency expenditures caused by changes in currency rates. We
    entered into IDR/$ forward purchase contracts to hedge up to 80%
    of our IDR denominated operating expenditures which results in a
    blended IDR/$ rate realized each period. The hedges are forward
    purchase contracts with expiration dates ranging up to one year
    from the date of issue which increased Batu Hijau

Costs
    applicable to sales

by $2 in 2008, and reduced Batu Hijau

Costs applicable to sales

by $4 and $11 in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2008, we have hedged 31%
    of our expected 2009 IDR operating expenditures.

During the third quarter of 2007, we began a multi-year
    systematic, disciplined layered program to hedge up to 85% of
    our A$ denominated operating expenditures with forward contracts
    that have expiration dates ranging up to three years from the
    date of issue. The principal hedging objective is reduction in
    the volatility of realized

period-on-period

$/A$ rates. Each month, fixed forward contracts are obtained to
    hedge 1/36th of the forecasted monthly A$ operating cost
    exposure in the rolling three-year hedge period resulting in a
    blended $/A$ rate realized. During 2008 and 2007, the A$
    operating hedge program increased Australia/New Zealand

Costs
    applicable to sales

by $13 and reduced Australia/New Zealand

Costs applicable to sales

by $1, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2008, we have hedged 66%, 38% and 12% of our
    expected 2009, 2010 and 2011 A$ operating expenditures,
    respectively, which includes our 66.67% ownership in Boddington.

During the first quarter of 2008, we began a multi-year
    systematic, disciplined layered program to hedge up to 75% of
    our NZ$ denominated operating expenditures with forward
    contracts that have expiration dates ranging up to two years
    from the date of issue. The principal hedging objective is
    reduction in the volatility of realized

period-on-period

$/NZ$ rates. Each month, fixed forward contracts are obtained to
    hedge 1/24th of the forecasted monthly NZ$ operating cost
    exposure in the rolling two-year hedge period resulting in a
    blended $/NZ$ rate realized. During 2008, the NZ$ operating
    hedge program increased Australia/New Zealand

Costs
    applicable to sales

by $2. As of December 31, 2008, we
    have hedged 53% and 20% of our expected 2009 and 2010 NZ$
    operating expenditures, respectively.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, we began a program to hedge
    up to 95% of our A$ denominated capital expenditures related to
    the construction of Boddington. The program consists of



a series of fixed forward contracts and bought call option
    contracts with expiration dates ranging up to one year from the
    date of issue. The realized gains and losses associated with the
    capital expenditure hedge program will impact

Amortization

during future periods in which Boddington assets are placed
    into service and affect earnings. As of December 31, 2008,
    we have hedged 83% of our remaining A$ denominated Boddington
    capital expenditures for our 66.67% ownership.

Diesel Fixed
    Forward Contracts

During the first quarter of 2008, we implemented a program to
    hedge up to 66% of our operating cost exposure related to diesel
    prices of fuel consumed at our Nevada operations. The program
    consists of a series of financially settled fixed forward
    contracts with expiration dates of up to one year from the date
    of issue. During 2008, the Nevada diesel hedge program increased
    Nevada

    contracts designated as a hedge against a portion of our

    Under the hedge contract terms, we receive fixed-rate interest
    payments at 8.625% and pay floating-rate interest amounts based
    on periodic London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
    settings plus a spread, ranging from 2.60% to 3.49%. The hedge
    contracts decreased

Provisional
    Copper and Gold Sales

Under the long-established structure of sales agreements
    prevalent in the industry, substantially all of our copper and
    gold concentrate sales are provisionally priced at the time of
    shipment. The provisional prices are finalized in a
    contractually specified future period (generally one to five
    months from the shipment date) primarily based on quoted LME
    prices (copper) and the London P.M. fix (gold). Sales subject to
    final pricing are generally settled in a subsequent month or
    quarter. Because a significant portion of our copper and gold
    concentrate sales in any quarterly period usually remain subject
    to final pricing, the quarter-end forward price is a major
    determinant of recorded revenues and the average recorded copper
    price for the period.

LME copper prices averaged $3.16 per pound during 2008, compared
    with our recorded average provisional price of $3.03 per pound.
    The applicable forward copper price at the end of 2008 was $1.39
    per pound. During 2008, declining copper prices resulted in a
    provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of $48. At
    December 31, 2008, we had copper sales of 82 million
    pounds priced at an average of $1.39 per pound, subject to final
    pricing in the first quarter of 2009. The LME closing settlement
    price for copper on February 11, 2009 was $1.53 per pound.
    Assuming that the February 11, 2009 year-to-date
    average pricing of $1.48 per pound and average forward price of
    $1.59 per pound were applied to the December 31 provisionally
    priced sales, the weighted-average price for these sales would
    be approximately $1.51 per pound and would result in an increase
    to first-quarter 2009 revenues of approximately $10.

The average London P.M. fix was $872 per ounce during 2008,
    compared with our recorded average provisional price of $874 per
    ounce. The applicable forward gold price at the end of 2008 was
    $883 per ounce. During 2008, changes in gold prices resulted in
    a provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of $2. At
    December 31, 2008, we had gold sales of 9,000 ounces priced
    at an average of $883 per ounce, subject to final pricing in
    January 2009. The London P.M. fix on January 30, 2009 was
    $920 per ounce and the January 30, 2009 year-to-date
    average pricing was $859 per ounce. The change in the price for
    the provisionally priced sales at December 31, 2008 will
    have an insignificant effect on first quarter 2009 revenues.



Price-capped
    Forward Sales Contracts

In June 2007, we paid $578 to settle all of the
    1.85 million ounce price-capped forward sales contracts
    which were accounted for as normal sales contracts under
    FAS 133 and FASB Statement No. 138 “Accounting
    for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
    Activities-an Amendment to FASB Statement No. 133.” We
    reported a $531 pre-tax loss on the early settlement of the
    contracts, after a $47 reversal of previously recognized
    deferred revenue in 2007. See Note 3 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional details.

Copper Collar
    Contracts

During 2006, we entered into copper collar contracts to hedge
    the copper price realized during those periods. Final delivery
    under the copper collar contracts occurred in February 2007. As
    of December 31, 2006, approximately 13 million pounds
    of copper were hedged by the copper collar contracts, which had
    been designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted copper sales.
    As such, changes in the fair value related to the effective
    portion of the hedges were recorded in

Fixed and
    Variable Rate Debt

We have both fixed and variable rate debt. 66% and 86% of debt
    was fixed and 34% and 14% was variable as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. We have managed some of our fixed
    rate debt exposure by entering into interest rate swaps (see
    Interest Rate Swap Contracts above). Our fixed rate debt

ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    Company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors,
    management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, the
    Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

. Based
    upon its assessment, management concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2008, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company’s assessment of internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008
    has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
    which appears herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Newmont Mining
    Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of income (loss),
    comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows
    present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
    of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2008 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to
    express opinions on these financial statements and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    uncertain tax positions effective January 1, 2007, and
    changed its methods of accounting for share-based payments,
    stripping costs incurred during the production phase and defined
    benefit pension and other post retirement plans all effective
    January 1, 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in
    millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound
    amounts)

NOTE 1

THE
    COMPANY

Newmont Mining Corporation and its affiliates and subsidiaries
    (collectively, “Newmont” or the “Company”)
    predominantly operate in a single industry, namely, exploration
    for and production of gold.

The Company’s sales result from operations in the United
    States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, Bolivia, New
    Zealand and Mexico. The cash flow and profitability of the
    Company’s operations are significantly affected by the
    market price of gold, and to a lesser extent, copper. The prices
    of gold and copper can fluctuate widely and are affected by
    numerous factors beyond the Company’s control.

References to “A$” refers to Australian currency,
    “C$” to Canadian currency, “NZ$” to New
    Zealand currency, “IDR” to Indonesian currency and
    “$” to United States currency.

NOTE 2

SUMMARY OF
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of
    Estimates

The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been
    prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of the
    Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires the
    Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The more
    significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and
    assumptions relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for
    future cash flow estimates utilized in impairment calculations
    and units-of-production amortization calculations;
    environmental, reclamation and closure obligations; estimates of
    recoverable gold and other minerals in stockpile and leach pad
    inventories; estimates of fair value for certain reporting units
    and asset impairments (including impairments of goodwill,
    long-lived assets and investments); write-downs of inventory,
    stockpiles and ore on leach pads to net realizable value; post
    employment, post-retirement and other employee benefit
    liabilities; valuation allowances for deferred tax assets;
    reserves for contingencies and litigation; and the fair value
    and accounting treatment of financial instruments including
    marketable securities and derivative instruments. The Company
    bases its estimates on historical experience and on various
    other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
    circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may differ
    significantly from these estimates under different assumptions
    or conditions.

Principles of
    Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
    Newmont Mining Corporation and more-than-50%-owned subsidiaries
    that it controls and entities over which control is achieved
    through means other than voting rights. The Company also
    includes its pro-rata share of assets, liabilities and
    operations for unincorporated joint ventures in which it has an
    interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
    have been eliminated. The functional currency for the majority
    of the Company’s operations, including the Australian
    operations, is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of
    the Canadian operations is the Canadian dollar.

The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46(R)
    “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”
    (“FIN 46(R)”), which provides guidance on the
    identification and reporting for entities over which control is
    achieved through means other than voting rights. FIN 46(R)
    defines such entities as Variable Interest Entities
    (“VIEs”). Prior to May 25, 2007, the Company
    considered PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT” or
    “Batu Hijau”) a VIE since a minority



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

interest’s 20% ownership in PTNNT was not obligated to
    absorb the expected losses of the entity. On May 25, 2007,
    the minority partner fully repaid the loan (including accrued
    interest) and as a result, the Company’s economic interest
    was reduced from 52.875% to 45%. The Company determined that the
    repayment of the loan by the minority interest and the reduction
    of its economic interest was a reconsideration event according
    to FIN 46(R) and concluded that PTNNT was no longer a VIE.

Newmont identified the Nusa Tenggara Partnership
    (“NTP”), a partnership between Newmont and an
    affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation that owns an 80% interest in
    PTNNT, as a VIE due to certain capital structures and
    contractual relationships. As a result of the Company’s
    56.25% ownership in NTP, the Company continues to be the primary
    beneficiary of NTP and therefore consolidates Batu Hijau in its
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and
    highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
    months or less. Because of the short maturity of these
    investments, the carrying amounts approximate their fair value.
    Cash and cash equivalents are invested in United States Treasury
    securities and money market securities. Restricted cash is
    excluded from cash and cash equivalents and is included in other
    current and long-term assets.

Investments

Management determines the appropriate classification of its
    investments in equity securities at the time of purchase and
    reevaluates such determinations at each reporting date.
    Investments in incorporated entities in which the Company’s
    ownership is greater than 20% and less than 50%, or which the
    Company does not control through majority ownership or means
    other than voting rights, are accounted for by the equity method
    and are included in long-term assets. The Company accounts for
    its equity security investments as available for sale securities
    in accordance with FASB Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“FAS”) No. 115, “Accounting for
    Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” The
    Company periodically evaluates whether declines in fair values
    of its investments below the Company’s carrying value are
    other-than-temporary in accordance with FSP

No. FAS 115-1

and

FAS 124-1,

“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its
    Application to Certain Investments.” The Company’s
    policy is to generally treat a decline in the investment’s
    quoted market value that has lasted continuously for more than
    six months as an other-than-temporary decline in value. The
    Company also monitors its investments for events or changes in
    circumstances that have occurred that may have a significant
    adverse effect on the fair value of the investment and evaluates
    qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and
    duration of the unrealized loss and the Company’s ability
    to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs to
    determine if the decline in value of an investment is
    other-than-temporary. Declines in fair value below the
    Company’s carrying value deemed to be other-than-temporary
    are charged to earnings. Additional information concerning the
    Company’s equity method and security investments is
    included in Note 15.

Stockpiles,
    Ore on Leach Pads and Inventories

As described below, costs that are incurred in or benefit the
    productive process are accumulated as stockpiles, ore on leach
    pads and inventories. Stockpiles, ore on leach pads and
    inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or net
    realizable value. Net realizable value represents the estimated
    future sales price of the product based on current and long-term
    metals prices, less the estimated costs to complete production
    and bring the product to sale. Write-downs of stockpiles, ore on
    leach pads and inventories, resulting from net realizable value
    impairments, are reported as a component of

Costs applicable
    to sales

. The current portion of stockpiles, ore on leach
    pads and



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

inventories is determined based on the expected amounts to be
    processed within the next 12 months. Stockpiles, ore on
    leach pads and inventories not expected to be processed within
    the next 12 months are classified as long-term. The major
    classifications are as follows:

Stockpiles

Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine
    and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured
    by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the
    stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on
    assay data) and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates
    (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore
    tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated
    to stockpiles based on relative values of material stockpiled
    and processed using current mining costs incurred up to the
    point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable overhead and
    amortization relating to mining operations, and removed at each
    stockpile’s average cost per recoverable unit.

Ore on Leach
    Pads

The recovery of gold from certain gold oxide ores is achieved
    through the heap leaching process. Under this method, oxide ore
    is placed on leach pads where it is treated with a chemical
    solution, which dissolves the gold contained in the ore. The
    resulting gold-bearing solution is further processed in a plant
    where the gold is recovered. Costs are added to ore on leach
    pads based on current mining costs, including applicable
    amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed
    from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the
    average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the
    leach pad.

The estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are
    calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads
    (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed
    on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery
    percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover
    between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year
    of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching
    process is complete.

Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach
    pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on
    pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical
    balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits
    the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result,
    the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and
    estimates are refined based on actual results over time.
    Historically, the Company’s operating results have not been
    materially impacted by variations between the estimated and
    actual recoverable quantities of gold on its leach pads.
    Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting
    from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in
    write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a
    prospective basis.

In-process
    Inventory

In-process inventories represent materials that are currently in
    the process of being converted to a saleable product. Conversion
    processes vary depending on the nature of the ore and the
    specific processing facility, but include mill in-circuit, leach
    in-circuit, flotation and column cells, and carbon in-pulp
    inventories. In-process material is measured based on assays of
    the material fed into the process and the projected recoveries
    of the respective plants. In-process inventories are valued at
    the average cost of the material fed into the process
    attributable to the source material coming from the mines,
    stockpiles

and/or

leach
    pads plus the in-process conversion costs, including applicable
    amortization relating to the process facilities incurred to that
    point in the process.

    mining and processing activities are valued at the average cost
    of the respective in-process inventories incurred prior to the
    refining process, plus applicable refining costs.

Concentrate
    Inventory

Concentrate inventories represent copper and gold concentrate
    available for shipment. The Company values concentrate inventory
    at the average cost, including an allocable portion of support
    costs and amortization. Costs are added and removed to the
    concentrate inventory based on tons of concentrate and are
    valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.

Materials and
    Supplies

Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost
    or net realizable value. Cost includes applicable taxes and
    freight.

Property,
    Plant and Mine Development

Facilities and
    equipment

Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures
    that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment
    are capitalized and recorded at cost. The facilities and
    equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method at
    rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated
    productive lives, which do not exceed the related estimated mine
    lives, of such facilities based on proven and probable reserves.

Mine
    Development

Mine development costs include engineering and metallurgical
    studies, drilling and other related costs to delineate an ore
    body, the removal of overburden to initially expose an ore body
    at open pit surface mines and the building of access ways,
    shafts, lateral access, drifts, ramps and other infrastructure
    at underground mines. Costs incurred before mineralization is
    classified as proven and probable reserves are expensed and
    classified as

Exploration

or

Advanced projects,
    research and development

expense. Capitalization of mine
    development project costs, that meet the definition of an asset,
    begins once mineralization is classified as proven and probable
    reserves.

Drilling and related costs are capitalized for an ore body where
    proven and probable reserves exist and the activities are
    directed at obtaining additional information on the ore body or
    converting non-reserve mineralization to proven and probable
    reserves and the benefit is expected to be realized over a
    period beyond one year. All other drilling and related costs are
    expensed as incurred. Drilling costs incurred during the
    production phase for operational ore control are allocated to
    inventory costs and then included as a component of

Costs
    applicable to sales

.

The cost of removing overburden and waste materials to access
    the ore body at an open pit mine prior to the production phase
    are referred to as “pre-stripping costs.”
    Pre-stripping costs are capitalized during the development of an
    open pit mine. Where multiple open pits exist at a mining
    complex utilizing common processing facilities, pre-stripping
    costs are capitalized at each pit. The removal and production of
    de minimis saleable materials may occur during development and
    are recorded as

Other income

, net of incremental mining
    and processing costs.

The production phase of an open pit mine commences when saleable
    minerals, beyond a de minimis amount, are produced. Stripping
    costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are

variable production costs that are included as a component of
    inventory to be recognized in

Costs applicable to sales

in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory.

The Company’s definition of a mine and the mine’s
    production phase may differ from that of other companies in the
    mining industry resulting in incomparable allocations of
    stripping costs to deferred mine development and production
    costs. Other mining companies may expense pre-stripping costs
    associated with subsequent pits within a mining complex.

Mine development costs are amortized using the
    units-of-production (“UOP”) method based on estimated
    recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves. To
    the extent that these costs benefit an entire ore body, they are
    amortized over the estimated life of the ore body. Costs
    incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only
    provide benefit over the life of that area are amortized over
    the estimated life of that specific ore block or area.

Mineral
    Interests

Mineral interests include acquired interests in production,
    development and exploration stage properties. The mineral
    interests are capitalized at their fair value at the acquisition
    date, either as an individual asset purchase or as part of a
    business combination.

The value of such assets is primarily driven by the nature and
    amount of mineralized material believed to be contained in such
    properties. Production stage mineral interests represent
    interests in operating properties that contain proven and
    probable reserves. Development stage mineral interests represent
    interests in properties under development that contain proven
    and probable reserves. Exploration stage mineral interests
    represent interests in properties that are believed to
    potentially contain mineralized material consisting of
    (i) mineralized material such as inferred material within
    pits; measured, indicated and inferred material with
    insufficient drill spacing to qualify as proven and probable
    reserves; and inferred material in close proximity to proven and
    probable reserves; (ii) around-mine exploration potential
    such as inferred material not immediately adjacent to existing
    reserves and mineralization, but located within the immediate
    mine area; (iii) other mine-related exploration potential
    that is not part of measured, indicated or inferred material and
    is comprised mainly of material outside of the immediate mine
    area; (iv) greenfields exploration potential that is not
    associated with any other production, development or exploration
    stage property, as described above; or (v) any acquired
    right to explore or extract a potential mineral deposit. The
    Company’s mineral rights generally are enforceable
    regardless of whether proven and probable reserves have been
    established. In certain limited situations, the nature of a
    mineral right changes from an exploration right to a mining
    right upon the establishment of proven and probable reserves.
    The Company has the ability and intent to renew mineral
    interests where the existing term is not sufficient to recover
    all identified and valued proven and probable reserves

and/or

undeveloped mineralized material.

Asset
    Impairment

Long-lived
    Assets

The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for
    impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An
    impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future
    cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying
    amount of the assets, including goodwill, if any. An impairment
    loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated
    future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on
    quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other
    commodity prices (considering current and historical prices,
    trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs,
    capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on
    life-of-mine plans. Existing proven and probable reserves



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including
    mineralization that is not part of the measured, indicated or
    inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair
    value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and,
    subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired.
    The term “recoverable minerals” refers to the
    estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be
    obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing
    and treatment. Estimates of recoverable minerals from such
    exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on
    management’s relative confidence in such materials. In
    estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest
    level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are
    largely independent of future cash flows from other asset
    groups. The Company’s estimates of future cash flows are
    based on numerous assumptions and it is possible that actual
    future cash flows will be significantly different than the
    estimates, as actual future quantities of recoverable minerals,
    gold and other commodity prices, production levels and operating
    costs of production and capital are each subject to significant
    risks and uncertainties.

Goodwill

The Company evaluates, on at least an annual basis during the
    fourth quarter, the carrying amount of goodwill to determine
    whether current events and circumstances indicate that such
    carrying amount may no longer be recoverable. To accomplish
    this, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its
    reporting units to their carrying amounts. If the carrying value
    of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the
    Company compares the implied fair value of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill to its carrying amount, and any excess of
    the carrying value over the fair value is charged to earnings.
    The Company’s fair value estimates are based on numerous
    assumptions and it is possible that actual fair value will be
    significantly different than the estimates, as actual future
    quantities of recoverable minerals, gold and other commodity
    prices, production levels, operating costs and capital
    requirements are each subject to significant risks and
    uncertainties.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized, net of treatment and refining charges,
    from a sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    the price is determinable, the product has been delivered, the
    title has been transferred to the customer and collection of the
    sales price is reasonably assured. Revenues from by-product
    sales are credited to

Costs applicable to sales

as a
    by-product credit.

Concentrate sales are initially recorded based on 100% of the
    provisional sales prices. Until final settlement occurs,
    adjustments to the provisional sales prices are made to take
    into account the mark-to-market changes based on the forward
    prices for the estimated month of settlement. For changes in
    metal quantities upon receipt of new information and assay, the
    provisional sales quantities are adjusted as well. The principal
    risks associated with recognition of sales on a provisional
    basis include metal price fluctuations between the date
    initially recorded and the date of final settlement. If a
    significant decline in metal prices occurs between the
    provisional pricing date and the final settlement-date, it is
    reasonably possible that the Company could be required to return
    a portion of the sales proceeds received based on the
    provisional invoice.

The Company’s sales based on a provisional price contain an
    embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the
    host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the
    receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward
    London Metal Exchange price at the time of sale. The embedded
    derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is
    marked to market through earnings each period prior to final
    settlement.

Stripping
    Costs

Stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine
    are variable production costs that are included as a component
    of inventory to be recognized in

Costs applicable to sales

in the same period as the revenue from the sale of
    inventory. Capitalization of production stage stripping costs is
    appropriate only to the extent product inventory exists at the
    end of a reporting period.

Income and
    Mining Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability
    method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the
    financial reporting basis of the Company’s liabilities and
    assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and
    assets. This method generates either a net deferred income tax
    liability or asset for the Company, as measured by the statutory
    tax rates in effect. The Company derives its deferred income tax
    charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net
    deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year.
    Mining taxes represent Canadian provincial taxes levied on
    mining operations and are classified as income taxes; as such
    taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. With respect
    to the earnings that the Company derives from the operations of
    its consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the
    earnings are indefinitely reinvested, no deferred taxes have
    been provided on the unremitted earnings (including the excess
    of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for
    financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of such equity)
    of these consolidated companies.

The Company’s deferred income tax assets include certain
    future tax benefits. The Company records a valuation allowance
    against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when it
    believes, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more
    likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income
    tax asset will not be realized.

The Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties
    and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in
    multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon
    many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in
    various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from
    federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company
    recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for
    anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax
    jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent
    to which, additional taxes will be due. As of January 1,
    2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,”
    (“FIN 48”), an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” guidance
    to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 for additional
    information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of
    changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity
    of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may
    result in a payment that is materially different from the
    Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the
    Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less
    than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense
    would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to
    be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the
    liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the
    period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer
    necessary. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if
    any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Reclamation
    and Remediation Costs (Asset Retirement Costs and
    Obligations)

Asset retirement obligations are recognized when incurred and
    recorded as liabilities at fair value. The liability is accreted
    over time through periodic charges to earnings. In addition, the
    asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the asset’s
    carrying value and amortized over the life of the related asset.
    Reclamation costs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes
    in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of
    time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or
    amount



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of the reclamation and abandonment costs. The asset retirement
    obligation is based on when spending for an existing
    environmental disturbance will occur. The Company reviews, on an
    annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary, the asset
    retirement obligation at each mine site in accordance with FASB
    Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations.”

Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on
    management’s best estimate at the end of each period of the
    costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates
    include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and
    monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are
    reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised.

Foreign
    Currency

The functional currency for the majority of the Company’s
    operations, including the Australian operations, is the
    U.S. dollar. All monetary assets and liabilities where the
    functional currency is the U.S. dollar are translated at
    current exchange rates and the resulting adjustments are
    included in

Other income, net

. The functional currency of
    the Canadian operations is the Canadian dollar. All monetary
    assets and liabilities recorded in functional currencies other
    than U.S. dollars are translated at current exchange rates
    and the resulting adjustments are charged or credited directly
    to

Revenues and expenses in
    foreign currencies are translated at the weighted-average

Derivative
    Instruments

Newmont has fixed forward contracts and call option contracts
    designated as cash flow hedges in place to hedge against changes
    in foreign exchanges rates, fixed forward contracts designated
    as cash flow hedges in place to hedge against changes in diesel
    prices, and fixed to floating interest rate swap contracts
    designated as fair value hedges to provide balance to the
    Company’s mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In 2006,
    Newmont had zero cost copper collars to hedge the copper price
    realized during the period. The fair value of derivative
    contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges are reflected as assets
    or liabilities in the balance sheet. To the extent these hedges
    are effective in offsetting forecasted cash flows from the sale
    of production or production costs (the “effective
    portion”), changes in fair value are deferred in

. Amounts
    deferred in

in each period. Cash transactions related to the
    Company’s forward and option contracts accounted for as
    hedges are classified in the same category as the item being
    hedged in the statement of cash flows.

When derivative contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges are
    settled, accelerated or restructured before the maturity date of
    the contracts, the related amount in

Accumulated other
    comprehensive (loss) income

at the settlement date is
    deferred and reclassified to

or

, as applicable, when the originally
    designated hedged transaction impacts earnings.

The fair value of derivative contracts qualifying as fair value
    hedges are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance
    sheet. Changes in fair value are recorded in income in each
    period, consistent with recording changes to the mark-to-market
    value of the underlying hedged asset or liability in income.
    Changes in the mark-to-market value of the effective portion of
    interest rate swaps utilized by the Company to swap a portion of
    its fixed rate interest rate risk to floating rate risk are
    recognized as a component of

Interest expense, net of
    capitalized interest

.

Newmont assesses the effectiveness of the derivative contracts
    periodically using either regression analysis or the dollar
    offset approach, both retrospectively and prospectively, to
    determine

whether the hedging instruments have been highly effective in
    offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged items. The
    Company defines highly effective as the hedge contract and the
    item being hedged being between 0.8 and 1.25 correlated, and the
    Company measures the amount of any hedge ineffectiveness. The
    Company will also assess periodically whether the hedging
    instruments are expected to be highly effective in the future.
    If a hedging instrument is not expected to be highly effective,
    the Company will stop hedge accounting prospectively. In those
    instances, the gains or losses remain in

Net Income
    (Loss) per Common Share

Basic and diluted income (loss) per share are presented for

Net income (loss)

and for

Income (loss) from
    continuing operations

. Basic income (loss) per share is
    computed by dividing

Net income (loss)

or

Income
    (loss) from continuing operations

by the weighted-average
    number of outstanding common shares for the period, including
    the exchangeable shares (see Notes 12 and 21). Diluted
    income per share reflects the potential dilution that could
    occur if securities or other contracts that may require the
    issuance of common shares in the future were converted. Diluted
    income per share is computed by increasing the weighted-average
    number of outstanding common shares to include the additional
    common shares that would be outstanding after conversion and
    adjusting net income for changes that would result from the
    conversion. Only those securities or other contracts that result
    in a reduction in earnings per share are included in the
    calculation.

Comprehensive
    (Loss) Income

In addition to

Net income (loss), Comprehensive (loss) income

includes all changes in equity during a period, such as
    adjustments to minimum pension liabilities, foreign currency
    translation adjustments, the effective portion of changes in
    fair value of derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow

and FIN 46(R)-8 in the Company’s VIE disclosures.

Hierarchy of
    Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 162,
    “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles” (“FAS 162”) which identifies the
    sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting
    the principles to be used in the preparation of financial
    statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles (“GAAP”). FAS 162 was effective
    November 15, 2008, which was 60 days following the
    Security and Exchange Commission’s approval of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU
    Section 411, “

The Meaning of

Present Fairly in
    Conformity with GAAP.” The adoption of FAS 162 has had
    no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Fair Value
    Accounting

In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”).
    FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
    principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. The provisions of FAS 157 were adopted
    January 1, 2008. In February 2008, the FASB staff issued
    FSP

No. 157-2

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”
    (“FSP

FAS 157-2”).

FSP

FAS 157-2

delayed the effective date of FAS 157 for nonfinancial
    assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The
    provisions of FSP

FAS 157-2

are effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2009, and are not expected to have a significant
    impact on the Company.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 157-3,

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset Is Not Active” (“FSP

FAS 157-3”),

which clarifies the application of FASB Statement No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”)
    in an inactive market. The intent of this FSP is to provide
    guidance on how the fair value of a financial asset is to be
    determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive.
    FSP

FAS 157-3 states

that determining fair value in an inactive market depends on the
    facts and circumstances, requires the use of significant
    judgment and in some cases, observable inputs may require
    significant adjustment based on unobservable data. Regardless of
    the valuation technique used, an entity must include appropriate
    risk adjustments that market participants would make for
    nonperformance and liquidity risks when determining fair value
    of an asset in an inactive market. FSP

FAS 157-3

was effective upon issuance. The Company has incorporated the
    principles of FSP

FAS 157-3

in determining the fair value of financial assets when the
    market for those assets is not active, specifically its
    marketable debt securities.



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

FAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
    the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
    The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
    (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to
    unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three
    levels of the fair value hierarchy under FAS 157 are
    described below:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible
    at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or
    liabilities;

Level 2

Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are
    observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
    full term of the asset or liability;

Level 3

Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both
    significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable
    (supported by little or no market activity).

The following table sets forth the Company’s financial
    assets and liabilities measured at fair value by level within
    the fair value hierarchy. As required by FAS 157, assets
    and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the
    lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
    measurement.

The Company’s cash equivalent instruments are classified
    within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are
    valued using quoted market prices. The cash instruments that are
    valued based on quoted market prices in active markets are
    primarily money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities.

The Company’s marketable equity securities are valued using
    quoted market prices in active markets and as such are
    classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The
    fair value of the marketable equity securities is calculated as
    the quoted market price of the marketable equity security
    multiplied by the quantity of shares held by the Company.

The Company’s marketable debt securities include
    investments in auction rate securities and asset backed
    commercial paper. The Company reviews fair value for auction
    rate securities and asset backed commercial paper on at least a
    quarterly basis. The auction rate securities are traded in
    markets that are not active, trade infrequently and have little
    price transparency. The Company estimated the fair values based
    on weighted average risk calculations using probabilistic cash
    flow assumptions. In January 2009, the investments in the
    Company’s asset backed commercial paper were restructured
    under court order. The restructuring allowed an interest
    distribution to be made to

investors. The auction rate securities and asset backed
    commercial paper are classified within Level 3 of the fair
    value hierarchy.

The Company’s net trade payable from provisional copper and
    gold concentrate sales is valued using quoted market prices
    based on the forward London Metal Exchange (“LME”)
    (copper) and the London Bullion Market Association P.M. fix
    (“London P.M. fix”) (gold) and, as such, is classified
    within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company’s derivative instruments are valued using
    pricing models and the Company generally uses similar models to
    value similar instruments. Where possible, the Company verifies
    the values produced by its pricing models to market prices.
    Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including
    contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit spreads,
    measures of volatility, and correlations of such inputs. The
    Company’s derivatives trade in liquid markets, and as such,
    model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve
    significant management judgment. Such instruments are classified
    within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company has fixed to floating swap contracts to hedge a
    portion of the interest rate risk exposure of its


/


%
    uncollateralized debentures due May 2011. The hedged portion of
    the Company’s


/


% debentures
    are valued using pricing models which require inputs, including
    risk-free interest rates and credit spreads. Because the inputs
    are derived from observable market data, the hedged portion of
    the

    is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair
    value of the Company’s Level 3 financial assets (asset

    year ended December 31, 2008.

    total assets measured at fair value.

In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (“FAS 159”). FAS 159
    permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments
    and certain other items at fair value, with the objective of
    improving financial reporting by mitigating volatility in
    reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and
    liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge
    accounting provisions. The provisions of FAS 159 were
    adopted January 1, 2008. The Company did not elect the Fair
    Value Option for any of its financial assets or liabilities, and
    therefore, the adoption of FAS 159 had no impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Accounting for
    Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment
    Awards

In June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
    reached consensus on Issue

No. 06-11,

“Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
    Share-Based Payment Awards”

(“EITF 06-11”).

EITF 06-11

requires that the tax benefit related to dividend and dividend
    equivalents paid on equity-classified nonvested shares and
    nonvested share units, which are expected to vest, be recorded
    as an

increase to additional paid-in capital.

EITF 06-11

has been applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends
    declared in the Company’s fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2008. The adoption of

EITF 06-11

had an insignificant impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Income
    Taxes

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of
    FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting and reporting for
    uncertainties in the application of the income tax laws to our
    operations. The interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model
    for the financial statement recognition, measurement,
    presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax provisions taken or
    expected to be taken in income tax returns. The cumulative
    effects of applying this interpretation were recorded as a
    decrease in retained earnings of $108, an increase of $5 in
    goodwill, an increase of $4 in minority interest, a decrease in
    net deferred tax assets of $37 (primarily, as a result of
    utilization of foreign tax credits and net operating losses as
    part of the FIN 48 measurement process, offset, in part, by
    the impact of the interaction of the Alternative Minimum Tax
    rules) and an increase of $72 in the net liability for
    unrecognized income tax benefits. Refer to Note 8.

The Company’s continuing practice is to recognize interest

and/or

penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its
    income tax expense. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    amount of accrued income-tax-related interest and penalties
    included in the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss) was $37
    for both years. During December 2008, the Company accrued an
    additional $31 of interest and penalties, paid $13 of interest,
    and released $18 as a result of the expiration of statute of
    limitations.

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns
    in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states and in
    foreign jurisdictions. With limited exception, the Company is no
    longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income or

non-U.S. income

tax audits by taxing authorities for years before 2005.

Pensions

As of December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions
    of FASB Statement No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post-Retirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and 132(R)” (“FAS 158”).
    FAS 158 required employers that sponsor one or more defined
    benefit plans to (i) recognize the funded status of a
    benefit plan in its statement of financial position,
    (ii) recognize the gains or losses and prior service costs
    or credits that arise during the period as a component of other
    comprehensive income, net of tax, (iii) measure the defined
    benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the
    employer’s fiscal year-end statement of financial position,
    and (iv) disclose in the notes to the financial statements
    additional information about certain effects on net periodic
    cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed
    recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or
    credits, and transition asset or obligation. The impact of
    adopting FAS 158 decreased

Accumulated other
    comprehensive (loss) income

by $27 as of December 31,
    2006.

Stock Based
    Compensation

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R),
    “

Share-Based Payment

”
    (“FAS 123(R)”). The Company adopted
    FAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition
    method. Under this method, compensation cost recognized in 2006
    included: a) compensation cost for all share-based payments
    granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006,
    based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
    the



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

original provisions of FAS 123, and b) compensation
    cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to
    January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123(R).
    As a result of adopting FAS 123(R), the Company’s

Income from continuing operations

and

Net income

for 2008 and 2006 was $10 ($0.02 per share) and $19 ($0.04
    per share) lower, respectively, and

and

Net loss

for 2007 was $11 ($0.02 per
    share) higher than if the Company had continued to account for
    share-based compensation under APB 25 as the Company did prior
    to January 1, 2006.

Deferred
    Stripping Costs

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Emerging Issues
    Task Force Issue

No. 04-06

(“EITF 04-06”),

“Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production
    in the Mining Industry.”

EITF 04-06

addresses the accounting for stripping costs incurred during the
    production phase of a mine and refers to these costs as variable
    production costs that should be included as a component of
    inventory to be recognized in

Costs applicable to sales

in the same period as the revenue from the sale of
    inventory. As a result, capitalization of post-production
    stripping costs is appropriate only to the extent product
    inventory exists at the end of a reporting period. The guidance
    required the recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment to
    opening retained earnings in the period of adoption, with no
    charge to earnings in the period of adoption for prior periods.
    The cumulative effect adjustment reduced retained earnings by
    $81 (net of tax and minority interests). Adoption of

EITF 04-06

had no impact on the Company’s cash position or net cash
    from operations.

Recently Issued
    Accounting Pronouncements

Post-Retirement
    Benefit Plan

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP
    No. FAS 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures
    about Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Assets” (“FSP
    FAS 132(R)-1”), which amends FASB Statement
    No. 132 “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions
    and Other Post-Retirement Benefits”
    (“FAS 132”), to provide guidance on an
    employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined
    benefit pension or other post-retirement plan. The objective of
    FSP FAS 132(R)-1 is to require more detailed disclosures
    about employers’ plan assets, including employers’
    investment strategies, major categories of plan assets,
    concentrations of risk within plan assets, and valuation
    techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets. FSP
    FAS 132(R)-1 is effective for the Company’s fiscal
    year beginning January 1, 2009. Upon initial application,
    the provisions of this FSP are not required for earlier periods
    that are presented for comparative purposes. The Company is
    currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this
    statement on the Company’s defined benefit pension and
    post-retirement benefit plan disclosures.

Equity Method
    Investment

In November 2008, the EITF reached consensus on Issue

No. 08-6,

“Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations”

(“EITF 08-6”),

which clarifies the accounting for certain transactions and
    impairment considerations involving equity method investments.
    The intent of

EITF 08-6

is to provide guidance on (i) determining the initial
    carrying value of an equity method investment,
    (ii) performing an impairment assessment of an underlying
    indefinite-lived intangible asset of an equity method
    investment, (iii) accounting for an equity method
    investee’s issuance of shares, and (iv) accounting for
    a change in an investment from the equity method to the cost
    method.

EITF 08-6

is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2009 and is to be applied prospectively. The
    Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting
    this statement on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.



NEWMONT MINING

Equity-Linked
    Financial Instruments

In June 2008, the EITF reached consensus on Issue

No. 07-5,

“Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is
    Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock”

(“EITF 07-5”).

EITF 07-5

clarifies the determination of whether an instrument (or an
    embedded feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock,
    which would qualify as a scope exception under FASB Statement
    No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities” (“FAS 133”).

EITF 07-5

is effective for the Company’s fiscal years beginning
    January 1, 2009. Early adoption for an existing instrument
    is not permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of

EITF 07-5

to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position or results of operations.

Accounting for
    Convertible Debt Instruments

In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. APB

14-1,

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement)” (“FSP APB

14-1”).

FSP APB

14-1

applies to convertible debt instruments that, by their stated
    terms, may be settled in cash (or other assets) upon conversion,
    including partial cash settlement, unless the embedded
    conversion option is required to be separately accounted for as
    a derivative under FAS 133. Convertible debt instruments
    within the scope of FSP APB

14-1

are not
    addressed by the existing APB 14. FSP APB

14-1

requires that the liability and equity components of convertible
    debt instruments within the scope of FSP APB

14-1

be
    separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the
    entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. This requires
    an allocation of the convertible debt proceeds between the
    liability component and the embedded conversion option (i.e.,
    the equity component). The difference between the principal
    amount of the debt and the amount of the proceeds allocated to
    the liability component will be reported as a debt discount and
    subsequently amortized to earnings over the instrument’s
    expected life using the effective interest method. FSP APB

14-1

is
    effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2009 and will be applied retrospectively to all
    periods presented. The Company estimates that approximately $301
    of debt discount will be recorded and the effective interest
    rate on the Company’s 2014 and 2017 convertible senior
    notes (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements) will increase by approximately 5 percentage
    points to 6.0% and 6.25%, respectively, for the non-cash
    amortization of the debt discount. If FSP APB

14-1

had
    been effective when the convertible debt instruments were
    issued,

Net income

would have been $21 ($0.05 per share)
    lower in 2008 and

Net loss

would have been $9 ($0.02 per
    share) higher in 2007.

Accounting for
    the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets”

(“FSP 142-3”)

which amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement
    No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
    (“FAS 142”). The intent of this FSP is to improve
    the consistency between the useful life of a recognized
    intangible asset under FAS 142 and the period of expected
    cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under
    FASB Statement No. 141, “Business Combinations”
    (“FAS 141”).

FSP 142-3

is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2009 and will be applied prospectively to
    intangible assets acquired after the effective date. The Company
    does not expect the adoption of

FSP 142-3

to have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Derivative
    Instruments

In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161,
    “Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133” (“FAS 161”) which



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

provides revised guidance for enhanced disclosures about how and
    why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative
    instruments and the related hedged items are accounted for under
    FAS 133, and how derivative instruments and the related
    hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance and cash flows. FAS 161 is effective
    for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1,
    2009. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact
    of adopting this statement on the Company’s derivative
    instrument disclosures.

Business
    Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement
    No. 141(R), “Business Combinations”
    (“FAS 141(R)”) which amends FAS 141, and
    provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring
    identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed,
    and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. It also
    provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the
    financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
    effects of the business combination. FAS 141(R) is
    effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2009 and is to be applied prospectively. This
    statement will impact how the Company accounts for future
    business combinations and the Company’s future consolidated
    financial position and results of operations.

Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“FAS 160”) which establishes accounting and
    reporting standards pertaining to (i) ownership interests
    in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent,
    (ii) the amount of net income attributable to the parent
    and to the noncontrolling interest, (iii) changes in a
    parent’s ownership interest, and (iv) the valuation of
    any retained noncontrolling equity investment when a subsidiary
    is deconsolidated. For presentation and disclosure purposes,
    FAS 160 requires noncontrolling interests to be classified
    as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
    FAS 160 is effective for the Company’s fiscal year
    beginning January 1, 2009.

NOTE 3

PRICE-CAPPED
    FORWARD SALES CONTRACTS

In 2001, the Company entered into transactions that closed out
    certain call options. The options were replaced with a series of
    forward sales contracts requiring physical delivery of the same
    quantity of gold over slightly extended future periods. Under
    the terms of the contracts, the Company would realize the lower
    of the spot price on the delivery date or the capped price,
    ranging from $381 to $392 per ounce. The forward sales contracts
    were accounted for as normal sales contracts under FAS 133
    and FASB Statement No. 138 “Accounting for Certain
    Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities-an
    Amendment to FASB Statement No. 133”
    (“FAS 138”). The initial fair value of the
    forward sales contracts was recorded as deferred revenue, and
    the fair value of these contracts was not included on the
    Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In June 2007, the Company paid $578 to settle all of the
    1.85 million ounce price-capped forward sales contracts.
    The Company reported a $531 pre-tax loss on the early settlement
    of the contracts, after a $47 reversal of previously recognized
    deferred revenue.

MIDAS
    REDEVELOPMENT

In June 2007, a fatal accident occurred at the Midas mine in
    Nevada, which resulted in a temporary suspension of operations
    at the mine to initiate rescue and subsequent recovery efforts.
    As a result, the Mine Safety and Health Administration
    (“MSHA”) issued an order requiring operations to
    temporarily cease at the mine. During the third and fourth
    quarters of 2007, activities were undertaken, at the direction
    of MSHA, to regain entry into the mine in order to resume
    commercial

NEWMONT MINING

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of
    FIN 48 which clarifies the accounting and reporting for
    uncertainties in the application of the income tax laws to our
    operations. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
    had $181 and $230 of total gross unrecognized tax benefits,
    respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending
    amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

    year

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $116 and $84, respectively,
    represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if
    recognized, would impact the Company’s effective income tax
    rate. Also included in the balance at December 31, 2008 and
    2007 are $11 and $13, respectively, of tax positions that, due
    to the impact of deferred tax accounting, the disallowance of
    which would not affect the annual effective tax rate.

The Company operates in numerous countries around the world and
    accordingly it is subject to, and pays annual income taxes
    under, the various income tax regimes in the countries in which
    it operates. Some of these tax regimes are defined by
    contractual agreements with the local government, and others are
    defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country.
    The Company has historically filed, and continues to file, all
    required income tax returns and paid the taxes reasonably
    determined to be due. The tax rules and regulations in many
    countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. From
    time to time the Company is subject to a review of its historic
    income tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes
    can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or
    application of certain rules to the Company’s business
    conducted within the country involved.

On June 25, 2008, the United States Tax Court issued an
    opinion for Santa Fe Pacific Gold Company and Subsidiaries
    (“Santa Fe”), by and through its successor in
    interest, Newmont USA Limited, a member of the Newmont Mining
    Corporation affiliated group. The Tax Court issued the ruling
    for the tax years 1994 — 1997, which were years prior
    to Newmont’s acquisition of Santa Fe. The Tax Court
    ruled unfavorably on certain issues relating to the method in
    which Santa Fe was calculating adjustments related to
    percentage depletion in its Alternative Minimum Tax calculation.
    As a direct result of that decision, during the second quarter,
    the Company increased its liability for uncertain income tax
    positions under FIN 48 by $27. Since the increase in the
    Company’s FIN 48 liability is attributable to
    additional alternative minimum tax amounts owed, these amounts
    can be used in the future by the Company as a credit against its
    regular US corporate tax liability. Management is currently
    exploring its legal options in order to decide how to proceed in
    response to the Tax Court opinion.

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns
    in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and
    foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no
    longer subject to U.S. Federal, state and local, and

non-U.S. income

tax examinations by tax authorities for years before



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2005. As a result of (i) statute of limitations that will
    begin to expire within the next 12 months in various
    jurisdictions, and (ii) possible settlements of
    audit-related issues with taxing authorities in various
    jurisdictions with respect to which none of the issues are
    individually significant, the Company believes that it is
    reasonably possible that the total amount of its net
    unrecognized income tax benefits will decrease between $3 to $5
    in the next 12 months.

The Company’s continuing practice is to recognize interest

and/or

penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its
    income tax expense. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    amount of accrued income-tax-related interest and penalties
    included in the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss) was $37
    for both years. During December 2008, the Company accrued an
    additional $31 of interest and penalties, paid $13 of interest,
    and released $18 as a result of the expiration of statute of
    limitations.

Newmont intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from certain
    foreign operations. Accordingly, U.S. and

non-U.S. income

and withholding taxes for which deferred taxes might otherwise
    be required, have not been provided on a cumulative amount of
    temporary differences (including, for this purpose, any
    difference between the tax basis in the stock of a consolidated
    subsidiary and the amount of the subsidiary’s net equity
    determined for financial reporting purposes) related to
    investments in foreign subsidiaries of approximately $434 and
    $773 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    additional U.S. and

non-U.S. income

and withholding tax that would arise on the reversal of the
    temporary differences could be offset in part, by tax credits.
    Because the determination of the amount of available tax credits
    and the limitations imposed on the annual utilization of such
    credits are subject to a highly complex series of calculations
    and expense allocations, it is impractical to estimate the
    amount of net income and withholding tax that might be payable
    if a reversal of temporary differences occurred.

As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the
    Company had (i) $669 and $684 of net operating loss carry
    forwards, respectively; and (ii) $154 and $72 of tax credit
    carry forwards, respectively. As of December 31, 2008 and
    2007, $559 and $493, respectively, of net operating loss carry
    forwards are attributable to acquired mining operations in
    Australia for which current tax law provides no expiration
    period. The remaining net operating losses available are
    attributable to acquired entities and have various temporal and
    other limitations that may restrict the ultimate realization of
    the tax benefits of such tax attributes.

Tax credit carry forwards for 2008 and 2007 of $76 and $72
    consist of foreign tax credits available in the United States;
    substantially all such credits not utilized will expire at the
    end of 2014. Other credit carry forwards at the end of 2008 and
    2007 in the amounts of $78 and $nil, respectively, represent
    alternative minimum tax credits attributable to the
    Company’s U.S. operations for which the current tax
    law provides no period of expiration.

The Company increased the valuation allowance related to
    deferred tax assets by $31 during 2008. This increase was offset
    by a decrease of $27 that had no impact on the Company’s
    effective tax rate. The valuation allowance remaining at the end
    of 2008 primarily is attributable to

non-U.S. subsidiaries

tax loss carryforwards.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $187 and
    $10, respectively, of foreign prepaid income taxes. See
    Note 18.

Newmont has a 45% ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine,
    held through the Nusa Tenggara partnership (“NTP”)
    with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan
    (“Sumitomo”). Newmont has a 56.25% interest in NTP and
    the Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTP in turn
    owns 80% of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”),
    the Indonesian subsidiary that operates the Batu Hijau mine.
    Newmont identified NTP as a VIE as a result of certain capital
    structures and contractual relationships. As a result, Newmont
    fully consolidates Batu Hijau in its consolidated financial
    statements. The remaining 20% interest in PTNNT is owned by
    P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an unrelated
    Indonesian company. Because PTPI had been advanced a loan by NTP
    and was not obligated to absorb the expected losses of PTNNT,
    PTPI’s interest was initially considered a carried interest
    and Newmont reported a 52.875% economic interest in Batu Hijau,
    which reflected Newmont’s actual economic interest in the
    mine until such time as the loan was fully repaid (including
    accrued interest). On May 25, 2007, PTPI fully repaid the
    loan (including accrued interest) from NTP. As a result of the
    loan repayment, Newmont’s economic interest in Batu Hijau
    was reduced from 52.875% to 45% and the Company recorded a net
    charge of $25 (after-tax) against

Minority interest expense

in the second quarter of 2007. During the second quarter of
    2008, PTNNT advanced PTPI $20, which is included in

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE

Discontinued operations include the royalty portfolio and
    Pajingo operation, both sold in 2007, as well as the
    Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture (“Zarafshan”)
    expropriated by the Uzbekistan government in 2006 and the
    Holloway operation and Martabe project, both sold in 2006.

In December 2007, the Company sold substantially all of
    Pajingo’s assets for cash and marketable equity securities
    totaling $23 resulting in a gain of $8. Additional Pajingo asset
    sales resulted in a gain of $1 in 2008.

In June 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a
    plan to cease Merchant Banking activities. As part of this plan,
    Newmont decided to dispose of the assets recorded in the royalty
    portfolio and a portion of the marketable equity securities
    portfolio and to cease further investments in marketable equity
    securities that do not support Newmont’s core gold mining
    business. In June 2007, Newmont recorded a $1,665 non-cash
    charge to impair the goodwill associated with the Merchant
    Banking Segment. In December 2007, Newmont received net cash
    proceeds of $1,187 and recognized a gain of $905 related to the
    sale of the royalty portfolio. In 2008, Newmont recognized
    additional royalty portfolio revenue of $6 in excess of the 2007
    estimate and recorded a $19 tax benefit related to the US tax
    return

on
    the sale of the royalty portfolio.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In 2006, Newmont recorded an impairment loss of $101 due to the
    Uzbekistan government’s expropriation of the Zarafshan
    operation. In 2007, after pursuing international
    arbitration,Newmont received proceeds of $80 and recognized a
    gain of $77 related to the settlement.

In 2006, Newmont received $271 net cash proceeds for the
    Alberta oil sands project, resulting in a $266 gain, received
    $42 net cash proceeds and approximately 43 million
    Agincourt shares valued at $37 for the Martabe project,
    resulting in a $30 gain and received $40 net cash proceeds
    plus certain royalties for the Holloway assets, resulting in a
    $13 gain.

Newmont has accounted for these dispositions in accordance with

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY AND INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

Newmont Common
    Stock

In October 2007, Newmont filed a shelf registration statement on

Form S-3

under which it can issue an indeterminate number or amount of
    common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of
    debt securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate
    prices. It also included the resale of an indeterminate amount
    of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time
    to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible
    securities.

The Company paid common stock dividends of $0.40 per share in
    2008, 2007 and 2006.

Treasury
    Stock

Treasury stock is acquired by the Company when certain
    restricted stock awards vest or are forfeited (see
    Note 23). At vesting, a participant has a tax liability
    and, pursuant to the participant’s award agreement, may
    elect withholding of restricted stock to satisfy tax withholding
    obligations. The withheld or forfeited stock is accounted for as
    treasury stock and carried at the par value of the related
    common stock.

Exchangeable
    Shares

In connection with the acquisition of Franco-Nevada Corporation
    (“Franco”) in February 2002, certain holders of Franco
    common stock received 0.8 of an exchangeable share of Newmont
    Mining Corporation of Canada Limited (formerly Franco) for each
    share of common stock held. These exchangeable shares are
    convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of Newmont
    common stock on a one-for-one basis, and entitle holders to
    dividends and other rights economically equivalent to holders of
    Newmont common stock. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    value of these no-par shares was included in

Additional
    paid-in capital

.

Call Spread
    Transactions

In connection with the issuance of $1,150 of convertible notes
    in July 2007 (see Note 21), the Company entered into
    separate convertible note hedge transactions and separate
    warrant transactions with respect to the Company’s common
    stock to minimize the impact of the potential dilution upon
    conversion of the convertible notes. The Company purchased call
    options in private transactions to cover 24,887,956 shares
    of the Company’s common stock at a strike price of $46.21
    per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, for
    approximately $366. The call options generally allow the Company
    to receive shares of the Company’s common stock from
    counterparties equal to the number of shares of common stock
    payable to the holders of the notes upon conversion. The Company
    also sold warrants in private transactions permitting the
    purchasers to acquire up to 24,887,956 shares of the
    Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $60.27,
    subject to adjustments in certain circumstances, for total
    proceeds of approximately $248.

The Company has analyzed the Call Spread Transactions under EITF
    Issue

No. 00-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
    to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
    Stock,” and other relevant literature, and determined that
    they meet the criteria for classification as equity
    transactions. As a result, the Company recorded the purchase of
    the call options as a reduction in additional paid-in capital
    and the proceeds of the warrants as an addition to paid-in
    capital, and the Company will not recognize subsequent changes
    in fair value of the instruments.

Net Income
    (Loss) per Common Share

Basic income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing
    income available to common shareholders by the weighted average
    number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
    income (loss) per common share is computed similarly to basic
    income per common share except that the denominator is increased
    to include the number of additional common shares that would
    have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares
    had been issued.

Options to purchase 4.4 million, 1.7 million and

    prices of $47.63, $52.76 and $48.48. were outstanding as of
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, but were
    not included in the computation of diluted weighted average
    number of common shares because the strike prices of the options
    exceeded the price of the common stock.

Other outstanding options to purchase 1.4 million shares of
    common stock were not included in the computation of diluted
    weighted average common shares in 2007 because their effect
    would have been anti-dilutive.

In July 2007, Newmont issued $1,150 of convertible notes that,
    if converted in the future, would have a potentially dilutive
    effect on the Company’s stock (see Note 21). Under the
    indenture for the convertible notes, upon conversion Newmont is
    required to settle the principal amount of the convertible notes
    in cash and may elect to settle the remaining conversion
    obligation (stock price in excess of the conversion price) in
    cash, shares or a combination thereof. The effect on diluted
    earnings per share is calculated under the net share settlement
    method in accordance with the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task
    Force

04-8,

“The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on
    Diluted Earnings per Share.” Under the net share settlement
    method, the Company includes the amount of shares it would take
    to satisfy the conversion obligation, assuming that all of the
    convertible notes are surrendered. The average closing price of
    the Company’s common stock for each of the

    The average price of the Company’s common stock for the
    year ended December 31, 2008 did not exceed the conversion
    price of $46.21 and therefore, did not have a dilutive effect on
    earnings per share.

ACQUISITIONS

In April 2008, the Company purchased 15,960 additional shares of
    EGR for $11 in cash bringing its ownership interest to 56.67%
    from 46.72%. EGR owns 100% of Valcambi SA
    (“Valcambi”), a London Good Delivery precious metals
    refiner and manufacturer of precious metal coins, medallions and
    luxury watch components. The additional interest resulted in the
    consolidation of EGR as of May 1, 2008 and increased

Other income, net

reflecting the
    service fee and secondary nature of EGR’s business to the
    Company’s central operations. Prior to consolidation, the
    Company accounted for EGR using the equity method of accounting.
    In November 2008, EGR repurchased 6.55% of its own shares from a
    minority shareholder bringing Newmont’s ownership to 60.64%.

In December 2007, the Company purchased approximately 70% of the
    common shares of Miramar Mining Corporation
    (“Miramar”), which, in addition to the shares
    previously owned, brought the Company’s interest in Miramar
    to approximately 78%. During the first quarter of 2008, the
    Company completed the acquisition of 100% of Miramar. All shares
    were purchased for C$6.25 per share in cash.

With the completion of the Miramar acquisition, the Company
    controls the Hope Bay project, a large undeveloped gold property
    in Nunavut, Canada. The acquisition and development of the Hope
    Bay project is consistent with the Company’s strategic

NOTE 14

DERIVATIVE
    INSTRUMENTS

Newmont’s strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage
    to changes in the gold price by selling the Company’s gold
    production at market prices. Prior to 2007, however, Newmont
    entered into derivative contracts to protect the selling price
    for certain anticipated gold and copper production. During 2007,
    the Company delivered into the last of the copper collar
    contracts and settled all price-capped forward gold sales
    contracts. The Company continues to manage risks associated with
    commodity inputs, interest rates and foreign currencies using
    the derivative market.

For 2008, 2007 and 2006, net gains (losses) of $10, $4 and
    $(60), respectively, were included in

Other income, net

for the ineffective portion of derivative instruments
    designated as fair value and cash flow hedges. All of the
    currency and diesel contracts have been designated as cash flow
    hedges of future expenditures, and as such, changes in the
    market value have been recorded in

Accumulated other
    comprehensive (loss) income

. The amount to be reclassified
    from

Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income

,

net of tax

to income for derivative instruments during
    the next 12 months is a loss of approximately $33. The
    maximum period over which hedged forecasted transactions are
    expected to occur is 3 years.

Foreign
    Currency Contracts

Newmont entered into a series of foreign currency contracts to
    hedge the variability of the US dollar amount of forecasted
    foreign currency expenditures caused by changes in currency
    rates. Newmont entered into IDR/$ forward purchase contracts to
    hedge up to 80% of the Company’s IDR denominated operating
    expenditures which results in a blended IDR/$ rate realized each
    period. The hedges are forward purchase contracts with
    expiration dates ranging up to one year from the date of issue
    which increased Batu Hijau

Costs applicable to sales

by
    $2 in 2008, and reduced Batu Hijau

Costs applicable to sales

by $4 and $11 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company has hedged 31% of its
    expected 2009 IDR operating expenditures.

During the third quarter of 2007, Newmont began a multi-year
    systematic, disciplined layered program to hedge up to 85% of
    the Company’s A$ denominated operating expenditures with
    forward contracts that have expiration dates ranging up to three
    years from the date of issue. The principal hedging objective is
    reduction in the volatility of realized

period-on-period

$/A$ rates. Each month, fixed forward contracts are obtained to
    hedge 1/36th of the forecasted monthly A$ operating cost
    exposure in the rolling three-year hedge period resulting in a
    blended $/A$ rate realized. During 2008 and 2007, the A$
    operating hedge program increased Australia/New Zealand

Costs
    applicable to sales

by $13 and reduced Australia/New Zealand

Costs applicable to sales

by $1, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company has hedged 66%, 38% and 12%
    of its expected 2009, 2010 and 2011 A$ operating expenditures,
    respectively, which includes our 66.67% ownership in Boddington.

During the first quarter of 2008, Newmont began a multi-year
    systematic, disciplined layered program to hedge up to 75% of
    the Company’s NZ$ denominated operating expenditures with
    forward contracts that have expiration dates ranging up to two
    years from the date of issue. The principal hedging objective is
    reduction in the volatility of realized

period-on-period

$/NZ$ rates. Each month, fixed forward contracts are obtained to
    hedge 1/24th of the forecasted monthly NZ$ operating cost
    exposure in the rolling two-year hedge period resulting in a
    blended $/NZ$ rate realized. During 2008, the NZ$ operating
    hedge program increased Australia/New Zealand

Costs
    applicable to sales

by $2. As of December 31, 2008, the
    Company has hedged 53% and 20% of its expected 2009 and 2010 NZ$
    operating expenditures, respectively.

Diesel Fixed
    Forward Contracts

During the first quarter of 2008, Newmont implemented a program
    to hedge up to 66% of its operating cost exposure related to
    diesel prices of fuel consumed at its Nevada operations. The
    program consists of a series of financially settled fixed
    forward contracts with expiration dates of up to one year from
    the date of issue. During 2008, the Nevada diesel hedge program
    increased Nevada

Interest Rate

As of December 31, 2008, Newmont had $100 fixed to floating
    swap contracts designated as a hedge against a portion of its

% debentures.
    Under the hedge contract terms, the Company receives fixed-rate
    interest payments at 8.625% and pays floating-rate interest
    amounts based on periodic London Interbank Offered Rate
    (“LIBOR”) settings plus a spread, ranging from 2.60%
    to 3.49%. The hedge contracts decreased

Provisional
    Copper and Gold Sales

Under the long-established structure of sales agreements
    prevalent in the industry, substantially all of the
    Company’s copper and gold concentrate sales are
    provisionally priced at the time of shipment. The provisional
    prices are finalized in a contractually specified future period
    (generally one to five months from the shipment date) primarily
    based on quoted LME prices (copper) and the London P.M. fix
    (gold). Sales subject to final pricing are generally settled in
    a subsequent month or quarter. Because a significant portion of
    the Company’s copper and gold concentrate sales in any
    quarterly period usually remain subject to final pricing, the
    quarter-end forward price is a major determinant of recorded
    revenues and the average recorded copper price for the period.

LME copper prices averaged $3.16 per pound during 2008, compared
    with the Company’s recorded average provisional price of
    $3.03 per pound. The applicable forward copper price at the end
    of 2008 was $1.39 per pound. During 2008, declining copper
    prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of
    $48. At December 31, 2008, the Company had copper sales of
    82 million pounds priced at an average of $1.39 per pound,
    subject to final pricing in the first quarter of 2009.

The average London P.M. fix was $872 per ounce during 2008,
    compared with the Company’s recorded average provisional
    price of $874 per ounce. The applicable forward gold price at
    the end of 2008 was $883 per ounce. During 2008, changes in gold
    prices resulted in a provisional pricing mark-

to-market loss of $2. At December 31, 2008, the Company had
    gold sales of 9,000 ounces priced at an average of $883 per
    ounce, subject to final pricing in the first quarter of 2009.

Price-capped
    Forward Sales Contracts

In June 2007, the Company paid $578 to settle all of the
    1.85 million ounce price-capped forward sales contracts
    which were accounted for as normal sales contracts under
    FAS 133 and FAS 138. The Company reported a $531
    pre-tax loss on the early settlement of the contracts, after a
    $47 reversal of previously recognized deferred revenue in 2007.
    See Note 3 for additional details.

Copper Collar
    Contracts

During 2006, Newmont entered into copper collar contracts to
    hedge the copper price realized during those periods. Final
    delivery under the copper collar contracts occurred in February
    2007. As of December 31, 2006, approximately
    13 million pounds of copper were hedged by the copper
    collar contracts, which had been designated as cash flow hedges
    of forecasted copper sales. As such, changes in the fair value
    related to the effective portion of the hedges were recorded in

The unrealized loss of $11 and $9 in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, relate to the Company’s investments in
    marketable equity securities, auction rate securities and asset
    backed commercial paper as listed in the December 31, 2008
    and 2007 tables above. While the fair values of these
    investments are below their respective cost, the Company views
    these declines as temporary. Generally the Company’s policy
    is to treat a decline in a marketable equity security’s
    quoted market value that has lasted continuously for more than
    six months as an other-than-temporary decline in value. The fair
    values of these marketable equity securities have not been
    continuously below cost for the past six months. The Company
    intends to hold its investment in auction rate securities and
    asset backed commercial paper until maturity or such time that
    the market recovers and therefore considers these losses
    temporary.

In 2007, annual testing for impairment pursuant to
    FAS No. 142 (comparison of implied goodwill value to
    carrying value) resulted in a goodwill impairment charge for the
    Exploration Segment of $1,122. The impairment resulted primarily
    from adverse changes in valuation assumptions and the
    application of a revised industry definition of value beyond
    proven and probable reserves (“VBPP”). The changes to
    valuation assumptions included: (i) a significantly lower
    assumed annual reserve growth rate (from 4% to 3%), (ii) a
    significant change in the financial markets resulting in a
    significant increase in the discount rate (from 8% to 10%), and
    (iii) an increase in finding costs due to a combination of
    increased spending and reduced exploration success. The revised
    definition of VBPP ascribes more value to tangible mineral
    interest than the original definition used by the Company. As a
    result of applying the new definition of VBPP, the higher value

Sale-Leaseback
    of Refractory Ore Treatment Plant

In September 1994, the Company entered into a sale and leaseback
    agreement for its refractory ore treatment plant located in
    Carlin, Nevada. The lease term is 21 years and aggregate
    future minimum lease payments, which include interest, were $263
    and $299 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Future minimum lease payments are $37 in 2009, $36 in 2010, $39
    in 2011, $70 in 2012, $36 in 2013 and $45 thereafter. The lease
    includes purchase options during and at the end of the lease at
    predetermined prices. The interest rate on this sale-leaseback
    transaction is 6.36%. In connection with this transaction, the
    Company entered into certain interest rate hedging contracts
    that were settled for a gain of $11, which is recognized as a
    reduction of interest expense over the term of the lease.
    Including this gain, the effective interest rate on the
    borrowing is 6.15%. The related asset is specialized, therefore
    it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of this debt.

and the debentures are redeemable prior to maturity under
    certain conditions. Newmont has contracts to hedge the interest
    rate risk exposure on $100 of these debentures. The Company
    receives fixed-rate interest payments at 8.625% and pays
    floating-rate interest based on periodic London Interbank
    Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) settings plus a spread, ranging
    from 2.60% to 3.49% (see Note 14). Using prevailing
    interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value
    of these debentures was $225 and $238 as of December 31,
    2008, and 2007, respectively. The foregoing fair value estimate
    was prepared by an independent third party and may or may not
    reflect the actual trading value of this debt.

2014 and 2017
    Convertible Senior Notes

During July 2007, the Company completed a private offering of
    $1,150 convertible senior notes due in 2014 and 2017, each in
    the amount of $575. The 2014 Notes, maturing on July 15,
    2014, will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.25% per
    annum, and the 2017 Notes, maturing on July 15, 2017, will
    pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.625% per annum. The
    Notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, at a
    conversion price of $46.21 per share of common stock. Upon
    conversion, the principle amount and all accrued interest will
    be repaid in cash and any conversion premium will be settled in
    shares of our common stock or, at our election, cash or any
    combination of cash and shares of our common stock. When the
    conversion premium becomes dilutive to the Company’s
    earnings per share (Newmont’s share price exceeds $46.21)
    the shares will be included in the computation of diluted income
    per common share. The Company is not entitled to redeem the
    notes prior to their stated maturity dates. The net proceeds
    from the offering, after expenses, were approximately $1,126.

In connection with the convertible senior notes offering, the
    Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions and
    warrant transactions (“Call Spread Transactions”).
    These transactions included the purchase of call options and the
    sale of warrants. As a result of the Call Spread Transactions,
    the conversion price of $46.21 was effectively increased to
    $60.27. When the warrant transactions become dilutive to the
    Company’s earnings per share (Newmont’s share price
    exceeds $60.27) the underlying shares will be included in the
    computation of diluted income per common share. The Company has
    analyzed the Call Spread Transactions under EITF Issue

No. 00-19,

“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
    to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
    Stock,” and other relevant accounting literature, and
    determined that they meet the criteria for classification as
    equity transactions. As a result, the Company recorded the
    purchase of the call options as a reduction in paid-in capital
    and the proceeds of the warrants as an addition to paid-in
    capital, and the Company will not recognize subsequent changes
    in fair value of the agreements.

Project
    Financings

PTNNT Project
    Financing Facility

PTNNT has a project financing facility with a syndicate of
    banks. The scheduled repayments of this debt are semi-annual
    installments of $43 through November 2010 and $22 from May 2011
    through November 2013. Amounts outstanding under the project
    financing were $306 and $393 as of December 31, 2008 and
    2007.

The project financing facility is non-recourse to Newmont and
    substantially all of PTNNT’s assets are pledged as
    collateral. The carrying value of the property, plant and mine
    development was $1,359



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and $1,428 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Under the terms of the project financing facility, PTNNT must
    maintain an escrow account for the next interest and principle
    installment due in order to make any restricted payments. In
    November 2008, PTNNT made its principal and interest payments
    from the escrow account. Therefore, PTNNT cannot make any
    dividend or other restricted payments until the escrow account
    is replenished. As of December 31, 2007, the escrow account
    balance was $57 and was included in

Other long-term
    assets

.

The interest rate is based on blended fixed and floating rates
    and at market rates on December 31, 2008, the weighted
    average interest rate approximated LIBOR plus 1.6%. The weighted
    average interest rates were 5.6%, 6.9% and 6.7% during 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively, and the interest rates were 4.9%
    and 6.5% as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    The fair market value cannot be practicably determined due to
    the lack of available market information for this type of debt.

PTNNT Shareholder
    Loans

PTNNT has shareholder subordinated loan agreements
    (“Shareholder Loans”) with Newmont Indonesia Limited
    (“NIL”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newmont, and
    Nusa Tenggara Mining Corporation (“NTMC”), an
    affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation, with substantially the same
    terms for each shareholder. Total principal outstanding under
    these Shareholder Loans was $41 and $nil as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2008, 43.75%
    or approximately $18 was due to NTMC, an unrelated third-party,
    and was non-recourse to Newmont, with the remainder payable to
    Newmont. Payments of $nil and $36 were made to NTMC during 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Borrowings under the Shareholder Loans
    were guaranteed by Nusa Tenggara Partnership (“NTP”)
    and payable on demand, subject to the Senior Debt subordination
    terms. The 2008 Shareholder Loans are based on the
    six-month London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”)
    plus 8% for principal and LIBOR rate plus 9% for any unpaid
    accrued interest. The weighted average interest rates were
    10.6%, 8.4% and 8.2% during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
    and the interest rates were 10.6% and 8.4% as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Newmont and NTMC provide a contingent support line of credit to
    PTNNT. No funding was required in 2007 and $41 provided in 2008
    was under this contingent support agreement. Available
    additional support from NTP’s partners was $24, of which
    Newmont’s pro-rata share was $14, as of December 31,
    2008. Finally, subject to certain conditions, there is
    additional contingent support from NTP of $20 (Newmont’s
    pro-rata share is $11) in respect of Senior Debt obligations
    payable during 2009 and 2010, resulting from any debt service
    shortfall, if applicable.

Yanacocha

$24 from Banco de Credito del Peru
    Leasing.

During 2007, Yanacocha acquired nine
    haul trucks through a capital lease agreement with Banco de
    Credito del Peru. Monthly repayments began in January 2008 and
    continue for three years. The lease bears interest at an annual
    fixed rate of 6.10%.

$16 from Bank of Nova Scotia Leasing.

During
    2007, Yanacocha signed a $16 capital lease agreement with the
    Scotia Bank to acquire six haul trucks. As of December 2008 and

    bank for $16 and $4, respectively. Monthly repayments began in
    February 2008 and continue for three years. The lease bears
    interest at an annual fixed rate of 6.00%.

$100 Credit Facility.

During 2006, Yanacocha
    entered into an uncollateralized $100 bank financing with a
    syndicate of Peruvian commercial banks. Quarterly repayments

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

respectively. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a
    rate of LIBOR plus 1.875%. The loan is uncollateralized and
    non-recourse to Newmont. The estimated fair value of this credit
    facility approximates the carrying value as of December 31,
    2008.

$100 Bond Program.

During 2006, Yanacocha
    issued $100 of bonds into the Peruvian capital markets under a
    $200 bond program. The issuance is comprised of $42 of floating
    interest rate bonds bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus
    1.4375% and $58 of fixed rate bonds bearing an annual interest
    of 7.0%. Quarterly repayments commence in July 2010 for six
    years. The bonds are uncollateralized and are non-recourse to
    Newmont. The estimated fair value of these bonds approximates
    the carrying value as of December 31, 2008.

    remaining $10 in February 2009. Amounts borrowed are guaranteed
    by Newmont. Semi-annual payments through April 2017 are
    required. Borrowings bear interest of LIBOR plus 3.5%.

Corporate
    Revolving Credit Facility

The Company has an uncollateralized $2,000 revolving credit
    facility with a syndicate of commercial banks, which matures in
    April 2012. The facility contains a letter of credit
    sub-facility. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the
    credit ratings of the Company’s senior, uncollateralized,
    long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest at
    an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.28% or the
    lead bank’s prime interest rate. Facility fees accrue at an
    annual rate of 0.07% of the aggregate commitments. The Company
    also pays a utilization fee of 0.05% on the amount of revolving
    credit loans and letters of credit outstanding under the
    facility for each day on which the sum of such loans and letters
    of credit exceed 50% of the commitments under the facility. As
    of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the facility fees were 0.07%
    of the commitment. There was $519 and $440 outstanding under the
    letter of credit sub-facility as of December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, $757 was

Pension
    Plans

The Company’s pension plans include: (1) two
    qualified non-contributory defined benefit plans (for salaried
    employees and substantially all domestic hourly union
    employees); (2) one non-qualified plan (for salaried
    employees whose benefits under the qualified plan are limited by
    federal legislation); (3) two qualified plans for salaried
    and hourly Canadian employees; (4) one non-qualified plan
    for employees of PTNNT; (5) an international plan for
    select employees who are not eligible to participate in the

U.S.-based

plans because of citizenship; (6) one non-qualified plan
    for members of the board of directors; (7) one
    non-qualified plan for former employees under terminated plans;
    and (8) three qualified plans for salaried and hourly
    employees of the former Miramar operations, acquired in December
    2007. The vesting period for plans identified in (1) and
    (2) is five years of service. These plans’ benefit
    formulas are based on an employee’s years of credited
    service and either (i) such employee’s highest
    consecutive five years average pay (salaried plan) or
    (ii) a flat dollar amount adjusted by a service-weighted
    multiplier (hourly plan). The Canadian plan provides for full
    vesting of benefits upon remittance and the benefit formula is
    based on a percentage of annual pay. The PTNNT plan is based on
    Indonesian Labor Law and provides for benefits to employees at
    age 55 or if employment is terminated at mine closing. The
    benefits formula under the Indonesian Labor Law is based on an
    employee’s current salary and years of service prior to
    retirement or termination of employment at mine closing. The
    international retirement plan’s basic and savings accounts
    have a



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

graded vesting schedule and are fully vested after four years of
    service. The international retirement plan’s supplemental
    account is vested after attaining age 55 with 10 years
    of service or attaining age 62. The plan’s benefit
    formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in
    the plan document. The former Miramar operation’s plans
    will continue for current retired members and no additional
    employees will become eligible for benefits under these plans.

Pension costs are determined annually by independent actuaries
    and pension contributions to the qualified plans are made based
    on funding standards established under the Employee Retirement
    Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

Other Benefit
    Plans

The Company provides defined medical and life insurance benefits
    to selected qualified U.S. and Canadian retirees (generally
    salaried employees and to a limited extent their eligible
    dependents). In general, participants become eligible for these
    benefits upon retirement directly from the Company if they are
    at least 55 years old and, for U.S. employees, the
    combination of their age and years of service with the Company
    equals 75 or more. This benefit is not provided to employees who
    joined the Company after January 1, 2003.

Defined medical benefits cover most of the reasonable and
    customary charges for hospital, surgical, diagnostic and
    physician services and prescription drugs. Life insurance
    benefits are based on a percentage of final base annual salary
    and decline over time after retirement commences. The majority
    of the costs of these medical and life insurance benefits are
    paid by the Company. In 2003, the Company began a strategy to
    more equitably share costs with retirees and as of
    December 31, 2008, 75% of retiree medical coverage cost is
    paid by the Company. Qualified retirees that became eligible
    after January 1, 2003 are required to contribute additional
    amounts to the medical coverage.

Under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
    Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”), beginning in
    2006, the Act provides a prescription drug benefit under
    Medicare Part D, as well as a federal subsidy to plan
    sponsors of retiree healthcare plans that provide a prescription
    drug benefit to their participants that is at least actuarially
    equivalent to the benefit that is available under Medicare. The
    Company sponsors retiree health care plans that provide
    prescription drug benefits to eligible retirees that our plan
    actuaries have determined are actuarially equivalent to Medicare
    Part D. The effect of the Act was to decrease
    post-retirement projected benefit obligation by $8 and $6 at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Company’s qualified pension plans are funded with cash

    (“IRS”) rules and regulations. The Company’s
    non-qualified and other benefit plans are currently not funded,
    but exist as general corporate obligations. The information
    contained in the above tables indicates the combined funded
    status of qualified and non-qualified plans, in accordance with
    accounting pronouncements. Assumptions used for IRS purposes
    differ from those used for accounting purposes. The funded
    status shown above compares the projected benefit obligation
    (“PBO”) of all plans, which is an actuarial present
    value of obligations that takes into account assumptions as to
    future compensation levels of plan participants, to the fair
    value of the assets held in trust for the qualified plans.
    Accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”), which is an
    actuarial present value of benefits (whether vested or
    nonvested) attributed to employees based on employee service and

Yield curves matching our benefit obligations were derived using
    a cash flow analysis under the Citigroup pension discount curve.
    The Citigroup pension discount curve shows the relationship
    between interest rates and duration for hypothetical zero coupon
    investments. Under this approach, Treasury par curve data is
    used to set the shape of the yield curve and calculate the AA
    corporate spot yield at each maturity. The resulting curve was
    used to identify a discount rate for the Company

of 6.05% and 6.8% in 2008 and 2007, respectively, based on the
    timing of future benefit payments. The decision to use 8% as the
    expected long-term return on plan assets was made based on an
    analysis of the actual plan asset returns over multiple time
    horizons and review of assumptions used by other
    U.S. corporations with defined benefit plans of similar
    size and investment strategy and is reviewed periodically by the
    audit committee. The average actual return on plan assets during
    the 20 years ended December 31, 2008 approximated 9%.

The pension plans employ several independent investment firms
    which invest the assets of the plan in certain approved funds
    that correspond to specific asset classes with associated target
    allocations. Depending upon actual sector performance, the
    assets in the plan are periodically rebalanced to match the
    established target levels for the asset classes. The goal of the
    pension fund investment program is to achieve expected rates of
    return consistent with the investment risk associated with the
    approved investment portfolio. The investment performance of the
    plan and that of the individual investment firms is measured
    against recognized market indices. This performance is monitored
    by an investment committee comprised of members of the
    Company’s management, which is advised by an independent
    investment consultant. The performance of the plan is reviewed
    annually with the Audit Committee of the Company’s board of
    directors. The following is a summary of the target asset
    allocations for 2008 and the actual asset allocation at
    December 31, 2008.

The assumed health care cost trend rate to measure the expected

    7% for 2012, 6.3% for 2013, 5.7% for 2014, and 5% for 2015 and

Savings
    Plans

The Company has two qualified defined contribution savings
    plans, one that covers salaried and non-union hourly employees
    and one that covers substantially all hourly union employees. In
    addition, the Company has one non-qualified supplemental savings
    plan for salaried employees whose benefits under the qualified
    plan are limited by federal regulations. When an employee meets
    eligibility requirements, the Company matches 100% of employee
    contributions of up to 6% of base salary for the salaried and
    hourly plans. Effective March 2008, the Company makes a
    contribution between 5.0% and 7.5% (based on continuous years of
    service) to each non-union employee Retirement Contribution
    account at its sole discretion. Matching contributions are made
    with Newmont stock; however, no holding restrictions are placed
    on such contributions, which totaled $14 in 2008, $13 in 2007
    and $11 in 2006.

NOTE 23

STOCK BASED
    COMPENSATION

Employee Stock
    Options

The Company has a Stock Incentive Plan (“Stock Plan”)
    for executives and eligible employees. Under this Stock Plan,
    options to purchase shares of stock can be granted with exercise
    prices not less than fair market value of the underlying stock
    at the date of grant. Fair market value of a share of common
    stock as of the grant date is the average of the high and low
    sales prices for a share of the Company’s common stock on
    the New York Stock Exchange. The Company also maintains prior
    stock plans, but no longer grants awards under these plans.
    Options granted under the Company’s stock plans vest over
    periods of three years or more and are exercisable over a period
    of time not to exceed 10 years from grant date. As of
    December 31, 2008, 13,514,010 shares were available
    for future grants under the Stock Plan. During 2008, 2007 and
    2006, 1,416,963, 1,066,500 and 1,238,750 stock option awards
    were granted, respectively.

The value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant
    using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model requires the input of subjective
    assumptions, including the expected term of the option award and
    stock price volatility. The expected term of options granted is
    derived from historical data on employee exercise and
    post-vesting employment termination experience. Expected
    volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock at
    the time grants are issued (generally in April). These estimates
    involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management
    judgment. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected
    forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those options
    expected to vest. As a result, if other assumptions had been

RECLAMATION AND
    REMEDIATION LIABILITIES (ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS)

The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject
    to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the
    protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are
    continually changing and are generally becoming more
    restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to
    protect the public health and environment and believes its
    operations are in compliance with applicable laws and
    regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and
    expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such
    laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such
    future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are
    based principally on legal and regulatory requirements.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, $617 and $569,
    respectively, were accrued for reclamation obligations relating
    to currently or recently producing mineral properties. In
    addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning
    environmental obligations associated with former, primarily
    historic, mining activities. Generally, these matters concern
    developing and implementing remediation plans at the various
    sites involved. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, $163 and
    $125, respectively, were accrued for such obligations. These
    amounts are also included in

Additions to the reclamation liability in 2008 of $148 include
    additions relating to currently or recently producing mineral
    properties of $76 primarily for Yanacocha primarily due to a
    need for additional water treatment associated with the
    San Jose reservoir, the Phoenix mine at Nevada and Ahafo
    due to increased disturbance area related to mine expansion and
    the Golden Giant mine site related to additional water treatment
    costs, as well as additions relating to former mining operations
    of $72, primarily for Mt. Leyshon due to site characterization,
    stabilization and long-term surface water management due to
    overflow discharge from heavy rain, the Midnite mine site in
    light of the recent decisions made in the U.S. District
    Court for the Eastern District of Washington, additions to the
    Grass Valley, California mine site from the settlement of the
    water treatment dispute, and the Con Mine site acquired from the
    Miramar acquisition, primarily from a better understanding of
    the site conditions including soil cover materials, contractor
    services and water treatment costs.

Additions to reclamation in 2007 of $95 include additions
    relating to currently or recently producing mineral properties
    of $60 primarily for Batu Hijau due to increased waste dump
    reclamation areas due to mine expansion and Ghana, Nevada at the
    Phoenix mine and Yanacocha due to increased disturbance area
    related to mine expansion, and for former mining operations of
    $35 including additions to Resurrection, due to assumption of
    liabilities to settle litigation for CERCLA liability and
    Natural Resource Damages and Empire Mine.

In March 2007, the Company completed an agreement with Oxiana
    Resources (“Oxiana”) and Agincourt Resources
    (“Agincourt”) in connection with Oxiana’s offer
    to acquire Agincourt. The transaction followed the
    Company’s sale in 2006 of the Martabe project to Agincourt
    in exchange for Agincourt shares, and as a result, the Company
    received Oxiana shares classified as marketable equity
    securities valued at $64 in return for its 43 million
    Agincourt shares classified as marketable equity securities.

In December 2007, the Company sold its royalty portfolio for

SEGMENT AND
    RELATED INFORMATION

Newmont predominantly operates in a single industry, namely
    exploration for and production of gold. Newmont’s major
    operations include Nevada, Yanacocha, Australia/New Zealand,
    Batu Hijau and Africa. Newmont also has an Exploration Segment.
    The Exploration Segment is responsible for all activities,
    regardless of location, associated with the Company’s
    efforts to discover new mineralized material that will advance
    into proven and probable reserves.

The Company identifies its reportable segments as those
    consolidated mining operations or functional groups that
    represent more than 10% of the combined revenue, profit or loss
    or total assets of all reported operating segments. Consolidated
    mining operations or functional groups not meeting this
    threshold are aggregated at the applicable geographic or
    corporate level for segment reporting purposes. Earnings from
    operations do not reflect general corporate expenses, interest
    (except project-specific interest) or income taxes (except for
    equity investments). Intercompany revenue and expense amounts
    have been eliminated within each segment in order to report on
    the basis that management uses internally for evaluating segment
    performance.

During 2008, Newmont made certain reclassifications in its
    segment reporting presentation for 2007 and 2006 to conform to
    changes in presentation reflected in internal management
    reports, including the following:

•

Accretion, which was previously reported in

Costs applicable
    to sales

has been reclassified to a separate

Accretion

line item.

•

Regional administrative and community development, which were
    previously reported in

Costs applicable to sales

have
    been reclassified to

Other expense, net

for all periods
    presented.

•

Marketing, which was reported in

Costs applicable to sales

has been reclassified to

General and administrative

.

•

Write-down of investments, which was reported in Costs and
    expenses has been reclassified to

Other income, net

.

•

The Other Operations reportable segment includes the
    La Herradura, Kori Kollo and Golden Giant operations.

NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NOTE 33

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES

General

The Company follows FASB Statement No. 5, “Accounting
    for Contingencies,” in determining its accruals and
    disclosures with respect to loss contingencies other than tax
    contingencies provided for in accordance with FIN 48 (see
    Note 8). Accordingly, estimated losses from loss
    contingencies are accrued by a charge to income when information
    available prior to issuance of the financial statements
    indicates that it is probable (greater than a 75% probability)
    that a liability could be incurred and the amount of the loss
    can be reasonably estimated. Legal expenses associated with the
    contingency are expensed as incurred. If a loss contingency is
    not probable or reasonably estimable, disclosure of the loss
    contingency is made in the financial statements when it is at
    least reasonably possible that a material loss could be incurred.

Operating
    Segments

The Company’s operating segments are identified in
    Note 31. Except as noted in this paragraph, all of the
    Company’s commitments and contingencies specifically
    described in this Note 33 relate to the Corporate and Other
    reportable segment. The Nevada Operations matters under Newmont
    USA Limited relate to the Nevada reportable segment. The PT
    Newmont Minahasa Raya matters relate to the Other Operations
    reportable segment. The Yanacocha matters relate to the
    Yanacocha reportable segment. The Newmont Yandal Operations Pty
    Limited matter relates to the Australia/New Zealand reportable
    segment. The PTNNT matters relate to the Batu Hijau reportable
    segment.

Environmental
    Matters

The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject
    to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the
    environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing
    and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company
    conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and
    environment and believes its operations are in compliance with
    applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The
    Company has made, and expects to make in the future,
    expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but
    cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.

Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on
    legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2008 and
    2007, $617 and $569, respectively, were accrued for reclamation
    costs relating to mineral properties in accordance with FASB
    Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations.” The current portions of $49 and $57 at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, are included in

Other current liabilities

.

In addition, the Company is involved in several matters
    concerning environmental obligations associated with former
    mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing
    and implementing remediation plans at the various sites
    involved. The Company believes that the related environmental
    obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature
    with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk
    profile and the compliance required to meet general
    environmental standards. Based upon the Company’s best
    estimate of its liability for these matters, $163 and $125 were
    accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. These amounts are included in

Other current
    liabilities

and

Reclamation and remediation
    liabilities

. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these
    matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible
    that the liability for these matters could be as much as 126%
    greater or 7% lower than the amount accrued at December 31,
    2008. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed
    periodically based upon

facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in
    estimates are recorded in

Other expense, net

in the
    period estimates are revised.

Details about certain of the more significant matters involved
    are discussed below.

Dawn Mining
    Company LLC (“Dawn”) — 51% Newmont
    Owned

Midnite Mine Site.

Dawn previously leased an
    open pit uranium mine, currently inactive, on the Spokane Indian
    Reservation in the State of Washington. The mine site is subject
    to regulation by agencies of the U.S. Department of
    Interior (the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land
    Management), as well as the United States Environmental
    Protection Agency (“EPA”).

In 1991, Dawn’s mining lease at the mine was terminated. As
    a result, Dawn was required to file a formal mine closure and
    reclamation plan. The Department of Interior commenced an
    analysis of Dawn’s proposed plan and alternate closure and
    reclamation plans for the mine. Work on this analysis has been
    suspended indefinitely. In mid-2000, the mine was included on
    the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
    (“CERCLA”). In March 2003, the EPA notified Dawn and
    Newmont that it had thus far expended $12 on the Remedial
    Investigation/Feasibility Study (“RI/FS”) under
    CERCLA. In October 2005, the EPA issued the RI/FS on this
    property in which it indicated a preferred remedy estimated to
    cost approximately $150. Newmont and Dawn filed comments on the
    RI/FS with the EPA in January 2006. On October 3, 2006, the
    EPA issued a final Record of Decision in which it formally
    selected the preferred remedy identified in the RI/FS.

On January 28, 2005, the EPA filed a lawsuit against Dawn
    and Newmont under CERCLA in the U.S. District Court for the
    Eastern District of Washington. The EPA has asserted that Dawn
    and Newmont are liable for reclamation or remediation work and
    costs at the mine. Dawn does not have sufficient funds to pay
    for the reclamation plan it proposed or for any alternate plan,
    or for any additional remediation work or costs at the mine.

On July 14, 2008, after a bench trial, the Court held
    Newmont liable under CERCLA as an “operator” of the
    Midnite Mine. The Court previously ruled on summary judgment
    that both the U.S. Government and Dawn were liable under
    CERCLA. On October 17, 2008 the Court issued its written
    decision in the bench trial. The Court found Dawn and Newmont
    jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for past and future
    response costs, and ruled that each of Dawn and Newmont are
    responsible to pay one-third of such costs. The Court also found
    the U.S. Government liable on Dawn’s and
    Newmont’s contribution claim, and ruled that the
    U.S. Government is responsible to pay one-third of all past
    and future response costs. In November 2008, all parties
    appealed the Court’s ruling. Also in November 2008, the EPA
    issued an Administrative Order pursuant to Section 106 of
    CERCLA ordering Dawn and Newmont to conduct water treatment,
    testing and other preliminary remedial actions. However, the
    issue of whether the EPA’s preferred remedy is consistent
    with the National Contingency Plan has not yet come before the
    Court.

Newmont intends to continue to vigorously defend this matter and
    cannot reasonably predict the outcome of this lawsuit or the
    likelihood of any other action against Dawn or Newmont arising
    from this matter.

Dawn Mill Site.

Dawn also owns a uranium mill
    site facility, located on private land near Ford, Washington,
    which is subject to state and federal regulation. In late 1999,
    Dawn sought and later received approval from the State of
    Washington for a revised closure plan that expedites the
    reclamation process at the site. The currently approved plan for
    the site is guaranteed by Newmont.

    CORPORATION

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Idarado Mining
    Company (“Idarado”) — 80.1% Newmont
    Owned

In July 1992, Newmont and Idarado signed a consent decree with
    the State of Colorado (“State”), which was approved by
    the U.S. District Court of Colorado, to settle a lawsuit
    brought by the State under CERCLA.

Idarado agreed in the consent decree to undertake specified
    remediation work at its former mining site in the
    Telluride/Ouray area of Colorado. Remediation work at this
    property is substantially complete. If the remediation does not
    achieve specific performance objectives defined in the consent
    decree, the State may require Idarado to implement supplemental
    activities at the site, also as defined in the consent decree.
    Idarado and Newmont obtained a $6 reclamation bond to secure
    their potential obligations under the consent decree. In
    addition, Idarado settled natural resources damages and past and
    future response costs, and agreed to habitat enhancement work
    under the consent decree. Such habitat enhancement work is
    substantially complete.

Newmont Capital
    Limited (“Newmont Capital”) — 100% Newmont
    Owned

In February 1999, the EPA placed the Lava Cap mine site in
    Nevada County, California on the National Priorities List under
    CERCLA. The EPA then initiated a RI/FS under CERCLA to determine
    environmental conditions and remediation options at the site.

Newmont Capital, formerly known as Franco-Nevada Mining
    Corporation, Inc., owned the property for approximately three
    years from 1984 to 1986 but never mined or conducted exploration
    at the site. The EPA asserts that Newmont Capital is responsible
    for clean up costs incurred at the site. Newmont Capital and the
    EPA entered into a consent decree to settle all aspects of this
    matter except future potential Natural Resource Damage claims.
    The consent decree will be subject to approval by the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

Newmont USA
    Limited — 100% Newmont Owned

Pinal Creek.

Newmont is a defendant in a
    lawsuit brought on November 5, 1991 in U.S. District
    Court in Arizona by the Pinal Creek Group, alleging that Newmont
    and others are responsible for some portion of costs incurred to
    address groundwater contamination emanating from copper mining
    operations located in the area of Globe and Miami, Arizona. Two
    former subsidiaries of Newmont, Pinto Valley Copper Corporation
    and Magma Copper Company (now known as BHP Copper Inc.) owned
    some of the mines in the area between 1983 and 1987. The court
    has dismissed plaintiffs’ claims seeking to hold Newmont
    liable for the acts or omissions of its former subsidiaries.
    Newmont believes it has strong defenses to plaintiffs’
    remaining claims, including, without limitation that
    Newmont’s agents did not participate in any pollution
    causing activities; that Newmont’s liabilities, if any,
    were contractually transferred to one of the plaintiffs; that
    portions of plaintiffs’ claimed damages are not
    recoverable; and that Newmont’s equitable share of
    liability, if any, would be immaterial. While Newmont has denied
    liability and is vigorously defending these claims, it cannot
    reasonably predict the final outcome of this lawsuit.

Grass Valley.

On February 3, 2004, the
    City of Grass Valley, California brought suit against Newmont
    under CERCLA in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
    District of California. This matter involves an abandoned mine
    adit on property previously owned by a predecessor of Newmont
    and currently owned by the City of Grass Valley. The complaint
    alleges that the adit is discharging metals-bearing water into a
    stream on the property, in concentrations in excess of current
    EPA drinking water standards. On February 4, 2009, this
    matter was fully resolved by settlement. Pursuant to the
    settlement, Newmont has agreed to manage the water discharge on
    an ongoing basis.

Gray Eagle Mine Site.

By letter dated
    September 3, 2002, the EPA notified Newmont that the EPA
    had expended $3 in response costs to address environmental
    conditions associated with a historic tailings pile located at
    the Grey Eagle Mine site near Happy Camp, California, and
    requested that Newmont pay those costs. The EPA has identified
    four potentially responsible parties, including Newmont. Newmont
    does not believe it has any liability for environmental
    conditions at the Grey Eagle Mine site, and intends to
    vigorously defend any formal claims by the EPA. Newmont cannot
    reasonably predict the likelihood or outcome of any future
    action against it arising from this matter.

Ross Adams Mine Site.

By letter dated
    June 5, 2007, the U.S. Forest Service notified Newmont
    that it had expended approximately $0.3 in response costs to
    address environmental conditions at the Adams Ross mine in
    Prince of Wales, Alaska, and requested Newmont USA Limited pay
    those costs and perform an Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis
    (“EE/CA”) to assess what future response activities
    might need to be completed at the site. Newmont does not believe
    it has any liability for environmental conditions at the site,
    and intends to vigorously defend any formal claims by the EPA.
    Newmont has agreed to perform the EE/CA. Newmont cannot
    reasonably predict the likelihood or outcome of any future
    action against it arising from this matter.

PT Newmont
    Minahasa Raya (“PTNMR”) — 80% Newmont
    Owned

In July 2004, a criminal complaint was filed against PTNMR, the
    Newmont subsidiary that operated the Minahasa mine in Indonesia,
    alleging environmental pollution relating to submarine tailings
    placement into nearby Buyat Bay. The Indonesian police detained
    five PTNMR employees during September and October of 2004. The
    police investigation and the detention of PTNMR’s employees
    was declared illegal by the South Jakarta District Court in
    December 2004, but in March 2005, the Indonesian Supreme Court
    upheld the legality of the police investigation, and the police
    turned their evidence over to the local prosecutor. In July
    2005, the prosecutor filed an indictment against PTNMR and its
    President Director, alleging environmental pollution at Buyat
    Bay. After the court rejected motions to dismiss the proceeding,
    the trial proceeded and all evidence, including that of the
    defense, was presented in court by September 2006. In November
    2006 the prosecution filed its charge, seeking a three-year jail
    sentence for PTNMR’s President Director plus a nominal
    fine. In addition, the prosecution recommended a nominal fine
    against PTNMR. The defense filed responses in January 2007, and
    final briefing was completed in March 2007. On April 24,
    2007, the court entered its verdict acquitting PTNMR and its
    President Director of all charges. In May 2007, the prosecution
    appealed the decision of the court to the Indonesian Supreme
    Court, despite Indonesian laws that prohibit the appeal of a
    verdict of acquittal. In October 2008, a panel of Supreme Court
    justices was assigned to consider the appeal.

In addition, on March 22, 2007, an Indonesian
    non-governmental organization named Wahana Lingkungan Hidup
    Indonesia (“WALHI”) filed a civil suit against PTNMR
    and Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources
    and Ministry for the Environment, alleging pollution from the
    disposal of mine tailings into Buyat Bay, and seeking a court
    order requiring PTNMR to fund a

25-year

monitoring program in relation to Buyat Bay. In December 2007,
    the court ruled in PTNMR’s favor and found that
    WALHI’s allegations of pollution in Buyat Bay were without
    merit. In March 2008, WALHI appealed this decision to the
    Indonesian Supreme Court.

Independent sampling and testing of Buyat Bay water and fish, as
    well as area residents, conducted by the World Health
    Organization and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and
    Industrial Research Organization, confirm that PTNMR has not
    polluted the Buyat Bay environment, and, therefore, has not
    adversely affected the fish in Buyat Bay or the health of nearby
    residents. The Company remains steadfast that it has not caused
    pollution or health problems and will continue to vigorously
    defend itself against these allegations.

Resurrection
    Mining Company (“Resurrection”) — 100%
    Newmont Owned

Newmont, Resurrection and other defendants were named in
    lawsuits filed by the State of Colorado under CERCLA in 1983,
    which were subsequently consolidated with a lawsuit filed by EPA
    in 1986. These proceedings sought to compel the defendants to
    remediate the impacts of pre-existing, historic mining
    activities near Leadville, Colorado, which date back to the
    mid-1800s, and which the government agencies claim were causing
    substantial environmental problems in the area.

In 1988 and 1989, the EPA issued administrative orders with
    respect to one area on the site and the defendants collectively
    implemented those orders by constructing a water treatment
    plant, which was placed in operation in early 1992. Remaining
    remedial work for this area consists of water treatment plant
    operation and continuing environmental monitoring and
    maintenance activities. The parties also entered into a consent
    decree with respect to the remaining areas at the site, which
    apportioned liabilities and responsibilities for these areas.
    The EPA approved remedial actions for selected components of
    Resurrection’s portion of the site, which actions were
    initiated in 1995, but the EPA did not select the final remedy
    for the site at that time.

On August 9, 2005, ASARCO LLC, another potentially
    responsible party at the site, filed for Chapter 11
    bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
    District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”). In June
    2007, Resurrection, the EPA, the State and ASARCO reached a
    settlement relating to all outstanding issues at the site. In
    July 2007, the settlement was approved by the Bankruptcy Court
    and in August 2008 it was approved by the U.S. District
    Court for the District of Colorado. The settlement agreement as
    approved sets out the required remedial actions of the parties
    and, subject to completion of those remedial actions, resolves
    all outstanding matters related to the site.

    Matters

Minera Yanacocha
    S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) — 51.35% Newmont
    Owned

Choropampa.

In June 2000, a transport
    contractor of Yanacocha spilled approximately 151 kilograms of
    elemental mercury near the town of Choropampa, Peru, which is
    located 53 miles (85 kilometers) southwest of the Yanacocha
    mine. Elemental mercury is not used in Yanacocha’s
    operations but is a by-product of gold mining and was sold to a
    Lima firm for use in medical instruments and industrial
    applications. A comprehensive health and environmental
    remediation program was undertaken by Yanacocha in response to
    the incident. In August 2000, Yanacocha paid under protest a
    fine of 1,740,000 Peruvian soles (approximately $0.5) to the
    Peruvian government. Yanacocha has entered into settlement
    agreements with a number of individuals impacted by the
    incident. As compensation for the disruption and inconvenience
    caused by the incident, Yanacocha entered into agreements with
    and provided a variety of public works in the three communities
    impacted by this incident. Yanacocha cannot predict the
    likelihood of additional expenditures related to this matter.

Yanacocha, various wholly-owned subsidiaries of Newmont, and
    other defendants have been named in lawsuits filed by
    approximately 1,100 Peruvian citizens in Denver District Court
    for the State of Colorado. These actions seek compensatory
    damages based on claims associated with the elemental mercury
    spill incident. The parties in these cases agreed to submit
    these matters to binding arbitration. In October 2007, the
    parties to the arbitration entered a court-approved settlement
    agreement, resolving most of these cases.

Additional lawsuits relating to the Choropampa incident were
    filed against Yanacocha in the local courts of Cajamarca, Peru,
    in May 2002 by over 900 Peruvian citizens. A significant number
    of the plaintiffs in these lawsuits entered into settlement
    agreements with Yanacocha prior to filing such

claims. In April 2008, the Peruvian Supreme Court upheld the
    validity of these settlement agreements, which should result in
    the dismissal of all claims brought by previously settled
    plaintiffs. Yanacocha has also entered into settlement
    agreements with approximately 350 additional plaintiffs. The
    claims asserted by approximately 200 plaintiffs remain. Neither
    Newmont nor Yanacocha can reasonably estimate the ultimate loss
    relating to such claims.

Conga.

Yanacocha is involved in a dispute with
    the Provincial Municipality of Celendin regarding the authority
    of that governmental body to regulate the development of the
    Conga project. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Municipality
    of Celendin enacted an ordinance declaring the area around Conga
    to be a mining-free reserve and naturally protected area.

Yanacocha has challenged this ordinance by means of two legal
    actions, one filed by Yanacocha (as the lease holder of the
    Conga mining concessions) and one filed by Minera Chaupiloma (as
    the titleholder of the Conga mining concessions). In August
    2007, a Peruvian Court of first instance upheld
    Chaupiloma’s claim, stating that the Municipality of
    Celendin lacks the authority to create natural protected areas.
    The Municipality of Celendin has not appealed the ruling. Based
    on legal precedent established by Peru’s Constitutional
    Tribunal and the foregoing resolution of the Chaupiloma claim,
    it is reasonable to believe that Yanacocha’s mining rights
    will be upheld.

Newmont Yandal
    Operations Pty Ltd (“NYOL”) — 100% Newmont

commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of
    New South Wales (Australia) against NYOL, its subsidiaries and
    the administrator in relation to the completed voluntary
    administration of the NYOL group. J. Aron & Co., a
    NYOL creditor, initially sought injunctive relief that was
    denied by the court on September 8, 2003. On
    October 30, 2003, J. Aron & Co. filed a statement
    of claim alleging various deficiencies in the implementation of
    the voluntary administration process and seeking damages and
    other relief against NYOL and other parties. Newmont cannot
    reasonably predict the final outcome of this lawsuit.

PT Newmont Nusa
    Tenggara (“PTNNT”) — 45% Newmont
    Owned

Under the Batu Hijau Contract of Work, beginning in 2006 and
    continuing through 2010, a portion of PTNNT’s shares must
    be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or,
    second, to Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between
    the following percentages and the percentage of shares already
    owned by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if
    such number is positive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by
    March 31, 2007; 37% by March 31, 2008; 44% by
    March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. As PT
    Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an Indonesian national, has
    owned and continues to own a 20% interest in PTNNT, in 2006 a 3%
    interest was required to be offered for sale and in each of 2007
    through 2010 an additional 7% interest must be offered (for an
    aggregate 31% interest). The price at which such interest must
    be offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of
    the then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares
    would be accepted for listing on the Indonesian Stock Exchange,
    or the fair market value of such interest as a going concern, as
    agreed with the Indonesian government. Pursuant to this
    provision, it is possible that the ownership interest of NTP in
    PTNNT could be reduced to 49%.

Initial
    arbitration matter

PTPI has owned and continues to own a 20% interest in PTNNT, and
    therefore the Newmont-Sumitomo partnership was required to offer
    a 3% interest in PTNNT for sale in 2006 and an additional 7%
    interest in each of 2007 through 2010. In accordance with the
    Contract of Work, an offer to sell a 3% interest was made to the
    Indonesian government in 2006 and an offer for an additional 7%
    interest was made in each of 2007 and 2008. A further 7%
    interest in the shares of PTNNT will be

offered for sale in March 2009. While the central government
    declined to participate in the 2006 and 2007 offers, local
    governments in the area in which the Batu Hijau mine is located
    have expressed interest in acquiring shares, as have various
    Indonesian nationals. In January 2008, the Newmont-Sumitomo
    partnership agreed to sell, under a carried interest
    arrangement, 2% of PTNNT’s shares to Kabupaten Sumbawa, one
    of the local governments, subject to satisfaction of closing
    conditions. The Indonesian government has subsequently stated
    that it will not approve the transfer of shares under this
    agreement. On February 11, 2008, PTNNT received
    notification from the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources
    (“DEMR”) alleging that PTNNT is in breach of its
    divestiture requirements under the Contract of Work, and
    threatening to issue a notice to terminate the Contract of Work
    if PTNNT did not agree to divest the 2006 and 2007 shares,
    in accordance with the direction of the DEMR, by
    February 22, 2008, which date was extended to March 3,
    2008. A second Notice of Default was received relating to the
    alleged failure to divest the 2008 shares as well. On
    March 3, 2008, the Indonesian government filed for
    international arbitration as provided under the Contract of
    Work, as did PTNNT. In the arbitration proceeding, PTNNT seeks a
    declaration that the Indonesian government is not entitled to
    terminate the Contract of Work and additional declarations
    pertaining to the procedures for divesting the shares. For its
    part, the Indonesian government seeks declarations that PTNNT is
    in default of its divestiture obligations, that the government
    may terminate the Contract of Work, and that PTNNT must cause
    shares subject to divestiture to be sold to certain local
    governments. The international arbitration panel has been
    appointed and a hearing was held in Jakarta in December 2008. A
    ruling is expected in the first half of 2009. Newmont and its
    Sumitomo partnership believe there is no basis for terminating
    the Contract of Work, and PTNNT is vigorously defending the
    matter.

Second
    arbitration matter

In 1997, to enable development of the Batu Hijau mine, PTNNT
    secured an aggregate $1,000 in financing from the United States
    Export-Import Bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation
    (formerly the Japan Export-Import Bank), and Kreditanstalt fur
    Wiederaufbau (the German Export-Import Bank) (collectively, the
    “Senior Lenders”). The Senior Lenders required the
    shareholders of PTNNT to pledge 100% of the shares of PTNNT as
    security for repayment of the loans. As part of that process, on
    October 30, 1997, the Minister of Energy and Mineral
    Resources approved the share pledge arrangements.

Subsequent to an additional 7% interest in PTNNT being offered
    by NTP for sale on March 28, 2008 (as required under the
    Contract of Work), the Director General of Mineral, Coal and
    Geothermal Resources at DEMR claimed that PTNNT breached its
    obligations under the Contract of Work by allowing shares to be
    offered for sale that are pledged to the Senior Lenders as
    security for the repayment of the senior debt. In the letter,
    the Director General claimed that NTP would be in default under
    the Contract of Work if the shares of PTNNT offered for sale in
    March 2008, together with the shares offered in 2006 and 2007,
    were not in the possession of “Indonesian government

and/or

government owned entities,” free of any such senior pledge,
    by July 13, 2008. Consequently, on July 10, 2008,
    PTNNT filed a notice to commence an additional international
    arbitration proceeding, as provided for under the Contract of
    Work, to resolve the claim that PTNNT breached its obligations
    under the Contract of Work by allowing shares to be offered that
    are subject to pledge obligations to the Senior Lenders. This
    pledge of shares issue has since been incorporated into and will
    be resolved as part of the initial arbitration proceeding.

NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In a 1993 asset exchange, a wholly-owned subsidiary transferred
    a coal lease under which the subsidiary had collected advance
    royalty payments totaling $484. From 1994 to 2018, remaining
    advance payments under the lease to the transferee total $390.
    In the event of title failure as stated in the lease, this
    subsidiary has a primary obligation to refund previously
    collected payments and has a secondary obligation to refund any
    of the $390 collected by the transferee, if the transferee fails
    to meet its refund obligation. The subsidiary has title
    insurance on the leased coal deposits of $240 covering the
    secondary obligation. The Company and the subsidiary regard the
    circumstances entitling the lessee to a refund as remote.

The Company has minimum royalty obligations on one of its
    producing mines in Nevada for the life of the mine. Amounts paid
    as a minimum royalty (where production royalties are less than
    the minimum obligation) in any year are recoverable in future
    years when the minimum royalty obligation is exceeded. Although
    the minimum royalty requirement may not be met in a particular
    year, the Company expects that over the mine life, gold
    production will be sufficient to meet the minimum royalty
    requirements. Minimum royalty payments payable are $19 per year
    in 2009 through 2013 and $93 thereafter.

As part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company and
    its affiliates are required to provide surety bonds, bank
    letters of credit and bank guarantees as financial support for
    various purposes, including environmental reclamation,
    exploration permitting, workers compensation programs and other
    general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    there were $778 and $662, respectively, of outstanding letters
    of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees. The surety bonds,
    letters of credit and bank guarantees reflect fair value as a
    condition of their underlying purpose and are subject to fees
    competitively determined in the market place. The obligations
    associated with these instruments are generally related to
    performance requirements that the Company addresses through its
    ongoing operations. As the specific requirements are met, the
    beneficiary of the associated instrument cancels

and/or

returns the instrument to the issuing entity. Certain of these
    instruments are associated with operating sites with long-lived
    assets and will remain outstanding until closure. Generally,
    bonding requirements associated with environmental regulation
    are becoming more restrictive. In addition, the surety markets
    for certain types of environmental bonding used by the Company
    have become increasingly constrained. The Company, however,
    believes it is in compliance with all applicable bonding
    obligations and will be able to satisfy future bonding
    requirements, through existing or alternative means, as they
    arise.

Newmont is from time to time involved in various legal
    proceedings related to its business. Except in the
    above-described proceedings, management does not believe that
    adverse decisions in any pending or threatened proceeding or
    that amounts that may be required to be paid by reason thereof
    will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial condition or results of operations.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

On January 27, 2009, the Company entered into a definitive
    sale and purchase agreement with AngloGold Ashanti Australia
    Limited to acquire its 33.33% interest in the Boddington project
    in Western Australia. Upon expected completion of the
    acquisition, Newmont will own 100% of the project. Consideration
    for the acquisition consists of $750 payable in cash at closing,
    $240 payable in cash

and/or

Newmont common stock, at the Company’s option, in December
    2009, and a royalty capped at $100, equal to 50% of the average
    realized operating margin (if any) exceeding $600 per ounce,
    payable on one-third of gold sales from Boddington. The
    valuation date for the transaction is January 1, 2009 and
    the transaction is expected to close in March 2009, subject to
    satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions and approvals.

On February 3, 2009, the Company completed a public
    offering of $518 convertible senior notes, including notes
    offered to cover over-allotments, maturing on February 15,
    2012 for net proceeds of $504 after deducting the underwriters
    discount and estimated expenses of the offering. The notes will
    pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.00% per annum. The
    notes are convertible, at the holder’s option, equivalent
    to a conversion price of $46.25 per share of common stock.

On February 3, 2009, the Company completed a public
    offering of 34,500,000 shares of common stock, including
    shares offered to cover over-allotments, at a price of $37.00,
    for net proceeds of $1,233 after deducting the underwriters
    discount and estimated expenses of the offering. Such

offerings were made pursuant to our automatic shelf registration
    statement on

Form S-3.

See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Shelf Registration Statement.

The following table represents the pro-forma capitalization of
    the Company assuming the completion of the public offerings of
    the convertible senior notes and common stock noted above as
    well as the impact of the adoption of FSP APB

14-1.

FSP
    APB

14-1

applies to convertible debt instruments and requires that the
    liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments
    within the scope be separately accounted for in a manner that
    reflects the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate.
    This requires an allocation of the convertible debt proceeds
    between the liability component and the embedded conversion
    option (i.e., the equity component). The difference between the
    principal amount of the debt and the amount of the proceeds
    allocated to the liability component will be reported as a debt
    discount and subsequently amortized to earnings over the
    instrument’s expected life using the effective interest
    method. FSP APB

14-1

is
    effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2009 and will be applied retrospectively to all
    periods presented.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

During the fiscal period covered by this report, the
    Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company,
    carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”)). Based on such evaluation, the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered
    by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits
    under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the required time periods and are designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports
    is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.

There has been no change in the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter
    that has materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

Management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting and the attestation report on management’s
    assessment are included in Item 8 of this annual report on

Form 10-K.
