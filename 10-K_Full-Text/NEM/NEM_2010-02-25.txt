    amounts)

Introduction

Newmont Mining Corporation is primarily a gold producer with
    significant assets or operations in the United States,
    Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, New Zealand and
    Mexico. At December 31, 2009, Newmont had proven and
    probable gold reserves of 91.8 million equity ounces and an
    aggregate land position of approximately 33,400 square
    miles (86,500 square kilometers). Newmont is also engaged
    in the production of copper, principally through its Batu Hijau
    operation in Indonesia and Boddington operation in Australia.
    Newmont Mining Corporation’s original predecessor
    corporation was incorporated in 1921 under the laws of Delaware.

Newmont’s corporate headquarters are in Greenwood Village,
    Colorado, USA. In this report, “Newmont,” the
    “Company,” “our” and “we” refer to
    Newmont Mining Corporation

and/or

our
    affiliates and subsidiaries.

Newmont’s net revenues and long-lived assets are

In September 2009, the Company completed a two part public
    offering of $900 and $1,100 senior notes maturing on
    October 1, 2019 and October 1, 2039, respectively. Net
    proceeds from the 2019 and 2039 notes were $895 and $1,080,
    respectively. The 2019 notes pay interest semi-annually at a
    rate of 5.13% per annum and the 2039 notes pay semi-annual
    interest of 6.25% per annum.

In June 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of the
    remaining 33.33% interest in Boddington from AngloGold Ashanti
    Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). The valuation date
    for the transaction was January 1, 2009, and closing
    adjustments were made to reflect Newmont’s economic
    ownership from that date. Consideration for the acquisition
    consisted of $750 less an $8 closing adjustment paid in cash at
    closing, $240 paid in cash in December 2009, and a contingent
    royalty capped at $100, equal to 50% of the average realized
    operating margin (Revenue less

Costs applicable to sales

on a by-product basis), if any, exceeding $600 per ounce,
    payable quarterly on one-third of gold sales from Boddington
    beginning in the second quarter of 2010. See Item 1A, Risk
    Factors, Risks Related to Newmont Operations, below.

In February 2009, we issued $518 of convertible senior notes,
    maturing on February 15, 2012. The notes pay interest
    semi-annually at a rate of 3.00% per annum. The notes are
    convertible, at the holder’s option, equivalent to a
    conversion price of $46.25 per share of common stock.
    Additionally, on February 3, 2009, we issued
    34,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $37.00,
    less an



underwriting discount of $1.17 per share. Net proceeds for the
    convertible senior notes and common stock offering were $504 and
    $1,234, respectively.

The February and September 2009 offerings were made pursuant to
    our automatic shelf registration statement on

Form S-3.

See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Segment
    Information, Export Sales, etc.

Our operating segments include North America, South America,
    Asia Pacific and Africa. Our North America segment consists
    primarily of Nevada, La Herradura in Mexico and Hope Bay in
    Canada. Our South America segment consists primarily of
    Yanacocha and Conga in Peru. Our Asia Pacific segment consists
    primarily of Batu Hijau in Indonesia, Boddington in Australia
    and other smaller operations in Australia/New Zealand. Our
    Africa segment consists primarily of Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana.
    See Item 1A, Risk Factors, Risks Related to Newmont
    Operations, below and Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for information relating to our operating segments,
    domestic and export sales, and lack of dependence on a limited
    number of customers.

Products

Gold

General.

We had consolidated gold sales of
    6.5 million ounces (5.3 million equity ounces) in
    2009, 6.2 million ounces (5.2 million equity ounces)
    in 2008 and 6.1 million ounces (5.3 million equity
    ounces) in 2007. For 2009, 2008 and 2007, 83%, 88% and 78%,
    respectively, of our net revenues were attributable to gold. Of
    our 2009 consolidated gold sales, approximately 32% came from
    North America, 32% from South America, 28% from Asia Pacific and
    8% from Africa. References in this report to “equity
    ounces” or “equity pounds” mean that portion of
    gold or copper produced, sold or included in proven and probable
    reserves that is attributable to our ownership or economic
    interest.

Most of our net revenue comes from the sale of refined gold in
    the international market. The end product at our gold
    operations, however, is generally doré bars. Doré is
    an alloy consisting primarily of gold but also containing silver
    and other metals. Doré is sent to refiners to produce
    bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% gold.
    Under the terms of our refining agreements, the doré bars
    are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and the
    separately-recovered silver are credited to our account or
    delivered to buyers. Gold sold from Batu Hijau in Indonesia and
    a portion of the gold from Boddington in Australia, Phoenix in
    Nevada and Yanacocha in Peru, is contained in a saleable
    concentrate containing other metals such as copper or silver.

Gold Uses.

Gold is generally used for
    fabrication or investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end
    uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and
    decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold
    investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry.

Gold Supply.

A combination of current mine
    production and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by
    governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations
    and private individuals make up the annual gold supply. Based on
    public information available for the years 2006 through 2009, on
    average, current mine production has accounted for approximately
    71% of the annual gold supply.



Gold Price.

The following table presents the
    annual high, low and average daily afternoon fixing prices for
    gold over the past ten years on the London Bullion Market
    ($/ounce).

On February 17, 2010, the afternoon fixing gold price on
    the London Bullion Market was $1,119 per ounce and the spot
    market gold price on the New York Commodity Exchange was $1,120
    per ounce.

We generally sell our gold at the prevailing market price during
    the month in which the gold is delivered to the customer. We
    recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable,
    the gold has been delivered, the title has been transferred and
    collection of the sales price is reasonably assured.

Copper

General.

We had consolidated copper sales of
    507 million pounds (226 million equity pounds) in
    2009, 290 million pounds (130 million equity pounds)
    in 2008 and 428 million pounds (200 million equity
    pounds) in 2007. For 2009, 2008 and 2007, 17%, 12% and 22%,
    respectively, of our net revenues were attributable to copper.
    Copper production at Batu Hijau, in Indonesia, and Boddington,
    in Australia, is in the form of saleable concentrate that is
    sold to smelters for further treatment and refining. At
    December 31, 2009, we had a 35.44% ownership interest but
    reported a 52.44% economic interest in the Batu Hijau operation
    in Indonesia, which began production in 1999. Copper production
    began in 2009 at Boddington.

Copper Uses.

Refined copper is incorporated
    into wire and cable products for use in the construction,
    electric utility, communications and transportation industries.
    Copper is also used in industrial equipment and machinery,
    consumer products and a variety of other electrical and
    electronic applications and is also used to make brass. Copper
    substitutes include aluminum, plastics, stainless steel and
    fiber optics. Refined, or cathode, copper is also an
    internationally traded commodity.

Copper Supply.

A combination of current mine
    production and recycled scrap material make up the annual copper
    supply.



Copper Price.

The copper price is quoted on
    the London Metal Exchange in terms of dollars per metric ton of
    high grade copper. The following table presents the dollar per

Source: London Metal Exchange

On February 17, 2010, the high grade copper closing price
    on the London Metal Exchange was $3.23 per pound. Our historic
    ability to sell copper at market prices was limited in some
    cases by hedging activities, more particularly described in
    Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gold and
    Copper Processing Methods

Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either heap
    leaching or milling, depending on the amount of gold contained
    in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related
    capital and operating costs. Higher grade oxide ores are
    generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into
    a fine powder and mixed with water in slurry, which then passes
    through a

carbon-in-leach

circuit. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using
    heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or

run-of-mine

ore on impermeable pads, where a weak cyanide solution is
    applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. In both
    cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected and pumped to
    process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or
    by zinc precipitation.

Gold contained in ores that are not naturally oxidized can be
    directly milled if the gold is amenable to cyanidation,
    generally known as free milling sulfide ores. Ores that are not
    amenable to cyanidation, known as refractory ores, require more
    costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free
    milling ore. Higher-grade refractory ores are processed through
    either roasters or autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore
    to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the
    sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use
    heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores.

Some sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant or
    by bio-milling. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into
    slurry, then placed in a tank known as a flotation cell.
    Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing
    sulfides to attach to air bubbles and float to the top of the
    tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into
    a concentrate that can then be processed in an autoclave or
    roaster to recover the gold. Bio-milling incorporates patented
    technology that involves inoculation of suitable crushed ore on
    a leach pad with naturally occurring bacteria strains, which
    oxidize the sulfides over a period of time. The ore is then
    processed through an oxide mill.

At Batu Hijau, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a
    coarse size at the mine and then transported from the mine via
    conveyor to a concentrator, where it is finely ground and then
    treated by



successive stages of flotation, resulting in a concentrate
    containing approximately 30% copper. The concentrate is
    dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for transport to
    smelters.

At Boddington, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a
    coarse size at the mine and then transported via conveyor to a
    process plant, where it is further crushed and then finely
    ground as a slurry. The ore is initially treated by flotation
    which produces a copper/gold concentrate containing
    approximately 18% copper. Flotation concentrates are processed
    via a gravity circuit to recover fine liberated gold and then
    dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for transport to
    smelters. The flotation tailing has a residual gold content that
    is recovered in a

carbon-in-leach

circuit.

At Phoenix, a process similar to that followed at Boddington is
    used to process a concentrate containing approximately 20%
    copper, which is loaded onto rail cars for transport to the
    smelter.

Hedging
    Activities

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes
    in the gold and copper prices by selling our gold and copper
    production at current market prices. Consequently, we do not
    hedge our gold and copper sales. We continue to manage risks
    associated with commodity input costs, interest rates and
    foreign currencies using the derivative market.

For additional information, see Hedging in Item 7A,
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and
    Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gold and Copper
    Reserves

At December 31, 2009 we had 91.8 million equity ounces
    of proven and probable gold reserves. We added 6.4 million
    equity ounces to proven and probable reserves, and depleted
    6.8 million equity ounces during 2009. We also added
    8.2 million equity ounces to proven and probable reserves
    through acquisitions and divested 1.0 million equity
    ounces. 2009 reserves were calculated at a gold price assumption
    of $800, A$1,000 or NZ$1,200 per ounce, respectively. A
    reconciliation of the changes in proven and probable gold
    reserves during the past three years follows:

In June 2009 reserves were increased by 6.7 million equity
    ounces through the acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest
    in Boddington. In December 2009 our economic interest in
    reserves increased by 1.5 million equity ounces as a result
    of transactions with a noncontrolling partner at Batu Hijau,
    which increased our economic interest to 52.44%.

(2)

In November and December 2009 our ownership in Batu Hijau
    decreased from 45% to 35.44% as a result of the divestiture
    required under the Contract of Work. In July 2009 we sold the
    Kori Kollo operation in Bolivia.

At December 31, 2009 we had 9,120 million equity
    pounds of proven and probable copper reserves. We added
    400 million equity pounds to proven and probable reserves
    and depleted 310 million equity pounds during 2009. We also
    added 2,040 million equity pounds to proven and probable
    reserves through acquisitions and divested 790 million
    equity pounds. 2009 reserves were calculated at a copper price
    of $2.00 or A$2.40 per pound. A reconciliation of the changes in

In June 2009 reserves were increased by 640 million equity
    pounds through the acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest
    in Boddington. In December 2009 our economic interest in
    reserves increased by 1,400 million equity pounds as a
    result of transactions with a noncontrolling partner at Batu
    Hijau, which increased our economic interest to 52.44%.

(2)

In November and December 2009 our ownership in Batu Hijau
    decreased from 45% to 35.44% as a result of the divestiture
    required under the Contract of Work.

Our exploration efforts are directed to the discovery of new
    mineralized material and converting it into proven and probable
    reserves. We conduct near-mine exploration around our existing
    mines and greenfields exploration in other regions globally.
    Near-mine exploration can result in the discovery of additional
    deposits, which may receive the economic benefit of existing
    operating, processing, and administrative infrastructures. In
    contrast, the discovery of new mineralization through
    greenfields exploration efforts will likely require capital
    investment to build a separate, stand-alone operation. We
    expensed $187 in 2009, $213 in 2008 and $177 in 2007 on

Exploration

.

For additional information, see Item 2, Properties, Proven
    and Probable Reserves.

Licenses and
    Concessions

Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing
    facilities, there are no third party patents, licenses or
    franchises material to our business. In many countries, however,
    we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to
    concessions granted by, or under contract with, the host
    government. These countries include, among others, Australia,

Condition of
    Physical Assets and Insurance

Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital
    investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of
    equipment and facilities. For more information, see Item 7,
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and
    Capital Resources, below.

We maintain insurance policies against property loss and
    business interruption and insure against risks that are typical
    in the operation of our business, in amounts that we believe to
    be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and
    limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to
    environmental liability and political risk. There can be no
    assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance
    policies in connection with a particular event. See
    Item 1A, Risk Factors, Risks Related to Newmont, below.



Environmental
    Matters

Our United States mining and exploration activities are subject
    to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the
    protection of the environment, including the Clean Air Act; the
    Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and
    Community

Right-to-Know

Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Federal Land Policy and
    Management Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the
    Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and related state laws.
    These laws and regulations are continually changing and are
    generally becoming more restrictive. Our activities outside the
    United States are also subject to governmental regulations for
    the protection of the environment.

We conduct our operations so as to protect public health and the
    environment and believe our operations are in compliance with
    applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Each
    operating mine has a reclamation plan in place that meets all
    applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have made, and
    expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such
    laws and regulations. We have made estimates of the amount of
    such expenditures, but cannot precisely predict the amount of
    such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are
    based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. At
    December 31, 2009, $698 was accrued for reclamation costs
    relating to current or recently producing properties.

In addition to legal and regulatory compliance, we have
    developed programs to guide our company toward achieving
    environmental and sustainable development objectives. Evidencing
    our management’s commitment towards these objectives, in
    2008, we moved our corporate headquarters to an environmentally
    sustainable, LEED, gold-certified building. We are also
    committed to managing climate change risks and responsibly
    reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. We have reported our
    greenhouse gas emissions annually to the Carbon Disclosure
    Project since 2004, became a Founding Reporter on The Climate
    Registry in 2008 and have committed to publicly reporting our
    independently-verified greenhouse gas emissions in the future.
    As a result of our efforts, we continue to achieve milestones,
    such as being the first gold company listed on the Dow Jones
    Sustainability Index World and receiving International Cyanide
    Management Code certification at 100% of registered Newmont
    sites as of the end of 2009.

We are also involved in several matters concerning environmental
    obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining
    activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and
    implementing remediation plans at the various sites. We believe
    that the related environmental obligations associated with these
    sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of
    remediation plans, their risk profile and the activities
    required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon our
    best estimate of our liability for these matters, $161 was
    accrued at December 31, 2009 for such obligations
    associated with properties previously owned or operated by us or
    our subsidiaries. These amounts are included in

Other current
    liabilities

and

Reclamation and remediation liabilities.

Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters,
    which is difficult to predict due to the legal and regulatory
    uncertainty of the related matters, we believe that it is
    reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could
    be as much as 148% greater or 3% lower, than the amount accrued
    at December 31, 2009. The amounts accrued for these matters
    are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances
    available at the time. Changes in estimates are charged to costs
    and expenses in the period when estimates are revised.

For a discussion of the most significant reclamation and
    remediation activities, see Item 7, Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and
    Results of Operations, and Notes 25 and 33 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, below.

Employees and
    Contractors

Approximately 14,500 people were employed by Newmont at
    December 31, 2009. In addition, approximately
    15,900 people were working as contractors in support of
    Newmont’s operations.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS (dollars in millions except per share, per ounce and per
    pound amounts)

Our business activities are subject to significant risks,
    including those described below. Every investor or potential
    investor in our securities should carefully consider these
    risks. If any of the described risks actually occurs, our
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially adversely affected. Such risks are not the only ones
    we face and additional risks and uncertainties not presently
    known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect
    our business.

A substantial
    or extended decline in gold or copper prices would have a
    material adverse effect on Newmont.

Our business is dependent on the price of gold and copper, which
    are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors
    tending to influence prices include:

•

gold sales or leasing by governments and central banks or
    changes in their monetary policy, including gold inventory
    management and reallocation of reserves;

•

speculative short positions taken by significant investors or
    traders in gold or copper;

•

the strength of the U.S. dollar;

•

recession or reduced economic activity in the United States and
    other industrialized or developing countries;

•

decreased industrial, jewelry or investment demand;

•

increased supply from production, disinvestment and scrap;

•

forward sales by producers in hedging or similar
    transactions; and

•

availability of cheaper substitute materials.

Any decline in our realized gold or copper price adversely
    impacts our revenues, net income and cash flows, particularly in
    light of our strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions
    with respect to



gold or copper. We have recorded asset write-downs in the past
    and may experience additional write-downs as a result of low
    gold or copper prices in the future.

In addition, sustained lower gold or copper prices can:

•

reduce revenues further through production declines due to
    cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits,
    that have become uneconomic at the then-prevailing gold or
    copper price;

•

reduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore
    stockpiles and ore on leach pads;

•

halt or delay the development of new projects;

•

reduce funds available for exploration with the result that
    depleted reserves may not be replaced; and

•

reduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can
    no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices.

Also see the discussion in Item 1, Business, Gold or Copper
    Price.

We may be
    unable to replace gold and copper reserves as they become
    depleted.

Gold and copper producers must continually replace reserves
    depleted by production to maintain production levels over the
    long term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted
    reserves can be replaced in several ways, including by expanding
    known ore bodies, by locating new deposits, or by acquiring
    interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly
    speculative in nature, involves many risks and frequently is
    unproductive. Our current or future exploration programs may not
    result in new mineral producing operations. In addition, for the
    year 2009, the global exploration budget was reduced
    significantly as compared to prior years, which may adversely
    affect the timing and extent of new mineral discoveries and the
    future replacement of reserves. Even if significant
    mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years
    from the initial phases of exploration until production, during
    which time the economic feasibility of production may change.

We may consider, from time to time, the acquisition of ore
    reserves related to development properties and operating mines.
    Such acquisitions are typically based on an analysis of a
    variety of factors including historical operating results,
    estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of ore
    reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash
    and other operating costs. Other factors that affect our
    decision to make any such acquisitions may also include our
    assumptions for future gold prices or other mineral prices and
    the projected economic returns and evaluations of existing or
    potential liabilities associated with the property and its
    operations and projections of how these may change in the
    future. In addition, in connection with future acquisitions we
    may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties and which
    may contain information or data that we are unable to
    independently verify or confirm. Other than historical operating
    results, all of these factors are uncertain and may have an
    impact on our revenue, our cash and other operating issues, as
    well as contributing to the uncertainties related to the process
    used to estimate ore reserves. In addition, there may be intense
    competition for the acquisition of attractive mining properties.

As a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs and
    any acquisitions which we may pursue may not result in the
    expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore
    reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and
    financial condition.



Estimates of
    proven and probable reserves are uncertain and the volume and
    grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our
    estimates.

Estimates of proven and probable reserves are subject to
    considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, to a large extent,
    based on the price of gold and interpretations of geologic data
    obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques.
    Producers use feasibility studies to derive estimates of capital
    and operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of
    ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of
    the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore,
    the costs of comparable facilities, the costs of operating and
    processing equipment and other factors. Actual operating costs
    and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from
    original estimates. Further, it may take many years from the
    initial phase of exploration before production and, during that
    time, the economic feasibility of exploiting a discovery may
    change.

In addition, if the price of gold or copper declines from recent
    levels, if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease,
    or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, we
    can offer no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will
    be realized or that mineral reserves as currently reported can
    be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain
    of our ore reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately
    lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported reserves.
    Consequently, if our actual mineral reserves and resources are
    less than current estimates, our business, prospects, results of
    operations and financial condition may be materially impaired.

Increased
    operating costs could affect our profitability.

Costs at any particular mining location are subject to variation
    due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grade, changing
    metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the
    physical shape and location of the ore body. In addition, costs
    are affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel,
    electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and
    concrete. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile
    price movements, including increases that could make production
    at certain operations less profitable, and to changes in laws
    and regulations affecting their price, use and transport.
    Reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting
    standards. A material increase in costs at any significant
    location could have a significant effect on our profitability
    and operating cash flow.

We could have significant increases in capital and operating
    costs over the next several years in connection with the
    development of new projects in challenging jurisdictions and in
    sustaining existing operations. Costs associated with capital
    expenditures have escalated on an industry-wide basis over the
    last several years, as a result of major factors beyond our
    control, including the prices of oil, steel and other
    commodities and labor. Increased costs for capital expenditures
    may have an adverse effect on the profitability of existing
    mining operations and economic returns anticipated from new
    mining projects.

Estimates
    relating to new development projects are uncertain and we may
    incur higher costs and lower economic returns than
    estimated.

Mine development projects typically require a number of years
    and significant expenditures during the development phase before
    production is possible. Our decision to develop a project is
    typically based on the feasibility studies results which
    estimate the anticipated economic returns of a project. The
    actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ
    from such estimates as a result of any of the following factors,
    among others:

•

unanticipated changes in tonnage, grades and metallurgical
    characteristics of ore to be mined and processed;

•

higher than anticipated input commodity and labor costs;

•

the quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were
    made;

•

unanticipated adverse geotechnical conditions;

•

availability of adequate labor force and supply and cost of
    water and power;



•

fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates;

•

availability and terms of financing;

•

delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or
    changes in the laws and regulations related to those permits;

•

unanticipated weather or severe climate impacts; and

•

potential delays relating to social and community issues.

Our future development activities may not result in the
    expansion or replacement of current production with new
    production, or one or more of these new production sites or
    facilities may be less profitable than currently anticipated or
    may not be profitable at all, any of which could have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
    condition.

We may
    experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards
    and uncertainties associated with mining.

The exploration for natural resources and the development and
    production of mining operations are activities that involve a
    high level of uncertainty. These can be difficult to predict and
    are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control.
    These factors include, but are not limited to:

•

environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, pollutants
    or hazardous chemicals;

•

industrial accidents including in connection with the operation
    of mining transportation equipment and accidents associated with
    the preparation and ignition of large-scale blasting operations;

•

underground fires or floods;

•

encountering unexpected geological formations;

•

unanticipated ground and water conditions;

•

fall-of-ground

accidents in underground operations;

•

failure of mining pit slopes and tailings dam walls;

•

seismic activity; and

•

other natural phenomena, such as floods or inclement weather
    conditions.

The occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with
    our mining operations may result in the death of, or personal
    injury to, our employees or other personnel, the loss of mining
    equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or
    production facilities, monetary losses, deferral or
    unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage
    and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely
    affect our business, prospects, results of operations and
    financial condition.

Shortages of
    critical parts, equipment and skilled labor may adversely affect
    our operations and development projects.

The industry has been impacted by increased demand for critical
    resources such as input commodities, drilling equipment, tires
    and skilled labor. These shortages have, at times, caused
    unanticipated cost increases and delays in delivery times,
    thereby impacting operating costs, capital expenditures and
    production schedules.



Compliance
    with the extensive and constantly changing environmental laws
    and regulations affecting mining operations requires ongoing
    expenditures from us, and actual or alleged non-compliance may
    subject us to significant penalties or to the revocation of
    existing or future exploration or mining rights.

Our exploration, mining and processing operations are regulated
    in all countries in which we operate under various federal,
    state, provincial and local laws relating to the protection of
    the environment, which generally include air and water quality,
    protection of protected species, hazardous waste management and
    reclamation. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes
    substantial costs and burdens, and can cause delays in
    obtaining, or failure to obtain, government permits and
    approvals which may adversely impact our operations. The
    regulatory environment in which we operate is constantly
    changing and may change in ways that would substantially
    increase costs to achieve compliance, or otherwise could have a
    material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.
    Additionally, our operations result in emissions of certain
    greenhouse gases that may be subject to regulation under
    legislative and regulatory measures recently enacted or in
    discussion. Such measures, if implemented, could result in
    increased costs to us and could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition or results of operations. For a more
    detailed discussion of potential environmental liabilities, see
    the discussion in Environmental Matters, Note 33 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Mine closure
    and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed
    the provisions we have made.

Natural resource companies are required to close their
    operations and rehabilitate the lands that they mine in
    accordance with a variety of environmental laws and regulations.
    Estimates of the total ultimate closure and rehabilitation costs
    for gold and copper mining operations are significant and based
    principally on current legal and regulatory requirements and
    mine closure plans that may change materially. Any
    underestimated or unanticipated rehabilitation costs could
    materially affect our asset values, earnings and cash flows.
    Environmental liabilities are accrued when they become known,
    probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whenever a previously
    unrecognized remediation liability becomes known, or a
    previously estimated reclamation cost is increased, the amount
    of that liability and additional cost will be recorded at that
    time and could materially reduce our consolidated net income in
    the related period. In addition, regulators are increasingly
    requesting security in the form of cash collateral, credit, or
    trust arrangements or guarantees to secure the performance of
    environmental obligations, which could have an adverse effect on
    our financial condition.

We have conducted extensive remediation work at two inactive
    sites in the United States. We are conducting mill remediation
    activities at a third site in the United States, an inactive
    uranium mine and mill formerly operated by a subsidiary of
    Newmont, but remediation at the mine is subject to dispute. In
    late 2008, the EPA issued an order regarding water management at
    the mine. The environmental standards that may ultimately be
    imposed at this site remain uncertain and a risk exists that the
    costs of remediation may exceed the financial accruals that have
    been made for such remediation by a material amount. For a more
    detailed discussion of potential environmental liabilities, see
    the discussion in Environmental Matters, Note 33 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Regulations
    and pending legislation governing issues involving climate
    change could result in increased operating costs which could
    have a material adverse effect on our business.

A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced
    or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the
    potential impacts of climate change. The December 1997 Kyoto
    Protocol, which ends in 2012, established a set of greenhouse
    gas emission targets for developed countries that have ratified
    the Protocol, which include Ghana, Australia and Peru. The
    Conference of Parties 15 (“COP15”) of the United
    Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in
    Copenhagen, Denmark in December 2009 was to determine the path
    forward after the Kyoto Protocol ends. COP15 resulted in the
    Copenhagen Accord (the “Accord”), a non-binding
    document calling for economy-wide



emissions targets for 2020. Prior to the January 31, 2010
    deadline, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and
    Indonesia, Ghana and Peru re-affirmed their commitment to the
    Accord. The U.S. Congress and several U.S. states have
    initiated legislation regarding climate change that will affect
    energy prices and demand for carbon intensive products. In
    December 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    issued an endangerment finding under the U.S. Clean Air Act
    that current and projected concentrations of certain mixed
    greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere
    threaten the public health and welfare. It is possible that
    proposed regulation may be promulgated in the U.S. to
    address the concerns raised by such endangerment finding.
    Additionally, the Australian Government may potentially
    reintroduce a national emissions trading scheme and mandatory
    renewable energy targets. Legislation and increased regulation
    regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us,
    our venture partners and our suppliers, including increased
    energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and
    reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. Any
    adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively
    impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas
    not subject to such limitations. Until the timing, scope and
    extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict
    the effect on our financial condition, operating performance and
    ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such regulation,
    increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global
    marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or
    other companies in our industry could harm our reputation. The
    potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations
    are highly uncertain, and would be particular to the geographic
    circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include
    changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water
    shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures. These
    impacts may adversely impact the cost, production and financial
    performance of our operations.

Our
    operations, particularly those outside North America and
    Australia/New Zealand, are subject to risks of doing
    business.

Exploration, development, production and mine closure
    activities, particularly those outside of North America and
    Australia/New Zealand, potentially are subject to political and
    economic risks, including:

•

disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that
    are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the
    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;

•

changes in laws or regulations;

•

royalty and tax increases or claims by governmental entities,
    including retroactive increases and claims and requests to
    renegotiate terms of existing royalties and taxes;

•

delays in obtaining or the inability to obtain or maintain
    necessary governmental permits;

•

expropriation or nationalization of property;

•

currency fluctuations, particularly in countries with high
    inflation;

•

foreign exchange controls;

•

restrictions on the ability of local operating companies to sell
    gold offshore for U.S. dollars, or on the ability of such
    companies to hold U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies
    in offshore bank accounts;

•

import and export regulations, including restrictions on the
    export of gold;

•

restrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore or to
    otherwise repatriate funds;

•

risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla
    activities, insurrection and terrorism;

•

risk of loss due to disease and other potential endemic health
    issues; and

•

other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in
    which our operations are conducted, including risks inherent in
    contracts with government owned entities such as unilateral
    cancellation or renegotiation of contracts, licenses or other
    mining rights.



Consequently, our exploration, development and production
    activities, particularly those outside of North America and
    Australia/New Zealand, may be affected by these and other
    factors, many of which are beyond our control, some of which
    could materially adversely affect our financial position or
    results of operations. Furthermore, if a dispute arises from
    such activities, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
    of courts outside North America or Australia/New Zealand, which
    could adversely affect the outcome of a dispute.

Our Batu Hijau
    operation in Indonesia is subject to political and economic
    risks.

We have a substantial investment in Indonesia, a nation that
    since 1997 has undergone financial crises and devaluation of its
    currency, outbreaks of political and religious violence and acts
    of terrorism, changes in national leadership, and the secession
    of East Timor, one of its former provinces. These factors
    heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy
    toward foreign investors, which in turn could result in
    unilateral modification of concessions or contracts, increased
    taxation, denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation
    of assets. Subsequent to the commencement of operations, the
    government designated the land surrounding Batu Hijau as a
    protection forest, which could make operating permits more
    difficult to obtain. We have been in discussions with the
    Indonesian government to obtain an additional forest use permit
    necessary to make certain amendments to the Batu Hijau
    environmental management plan and environmental monitoring plan,
    including modifications with respect to the mine’s pit
    slope stability. This permit is a key requirement to continue to
    operate Batu Hijau efficiently and to the ultimate life of the
    mine and recoverability of reserves. However, the permit has not
    been received as of the date of this Annual Report. No
    assurances can be made regarding when or whether the permit and
    any related plan amendments will be approved. The resulting
    delay may adversely impact the Batu Hijau mine plan, and may
    adversely impact future operating and financial results,
    including deferment or cancellation of future development and
    operations.

Presidential and parliamentary elections recently took place,
    and although the president was re-elected, new ministers or
    members of parliament may have different (and potentially more
    negative) views relating to mining in general, a preference for
    national mining companies to own such countries mineral assets,
    or relative to our assets and operations.

Violence committed by radical elements in Indonesia and other
    countries, and the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq and
    Afghanistan, may increase the risk that operations owned by
    U.S. companies will be the target of violence. If our Batu
    Hijau operation were so targeted it could have an adverse effect
    on our business.

Our ownership
    interest in PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”) in
    Indonesia has been reduced in accordance with the Contract of
    Work issued by the Indonesian Government. The Contract of Work
    has been and may continue to be the subject of dispute, and
    future reductions in our interest in PTNNT may result in our
    loss of control over the Batu Hijau operations. Moreover the
    Contract of Work is subject to termination if we do not comply
    with our obligations, and loss of the Contract of Work would
    result in loss of all or much of the value of Batu
    Hijau.

We operate Batu Hijau and currently have a 35.44% ownership
    interest, held through the Nusa Tenggara Partnership
    (“NTP”) with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of
    Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTP and a Sumitomo affiliate
    holds the remaining 43.75%. NTP in turn owns 63% of PTNNT, the
    Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. In December 2009,
    the Company entered into a transaction with P.T. Pukuafu
    Indah (“PTPI”), an unrelated noncontrolling partner of
    PTNNT, whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTPI in
    exchange for a pledge of the noncontrolling partner’s 20%
    share of PTNNT dividends, net of withholding tax, and the
    assignment of its voting rights to the Company. As a result,
    PTPI was determined to be a Variable Interest Entity
    (“VIE”) as it has minimal equity capital and the
    voting rights to its 20% interest in PTNNT reside with Newmont.
    Based on the above transaction, the Company recognized an
    additional 17% effective economic interest in PTNNT. Combined
    with the Company’s 56.25% ownership in NTP, Newmont has a
    52.44% effective economic interest in PTNNT and continues to
    consolidate Batu Hijau in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
    The remaining 17% in PTNNT is owned by PT Multi Daerah Bersaing



(“PTMDB”), a consortium comprised of Indonesian
    regional and local governments, and PT Multicapital, an
    unrelated Indonesian company.

Under the Contract of Work executed in 1986 between the
    Indonesian government and PTNNT, beginning in 2006 and
    continuing through 2010, a portion of PTNNT’s shares must
    be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or,
    second, to Indonesian nationals, such portion equal to the
    difference between the following percentages and the percentage
    of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or
    Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 23% by
    March 31, 2006; 30% by March 31, 2007; 37% by
    March 31, 2008; 44% by March 31, 2009; and 51% by
    March 31, 2010. The price at which such interest must be
    offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of the
    then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares would
    be accepted for listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or the
    fair market value of such interest as a going concern, as agreed
    with the Indonesian government. Pursuant to this provision, the
    ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine’s proven and
    probable equity reserves may be reduced in the future to as low
    as 27.56% and ownership interest of NTP in PTNNT could be
    reduced to 49%, thus reducing our ability to control the
    operation at Batu Hijau. In addition to affecting our level of
    control over operations over PTNNT, such loss of control may
    cause us to deconsolidate PTNNT for accounting purposes, which
    would reduce our reported consolidated sales, cost applicable to
    sales, amortization, total assets and operating cash flow
    attributable to PTNNT. See Note 32 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

PTPI has owned and continues to own a 20% interest in PTNNT, and
    therefore NTP was required to offer a 3% interest in the shares
    of PTNNT for sale in 2006 and an additional 7% interest in each
    of 2007, 2008 and 2009. In accordance with the Contract of Work,
    an offer to sell a 3% interest was made to the Indonesia
    government in 2006 and an offer for an additional 7% interest
    was made in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009. Following notifications
    from the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources (the
    “DEMR”) alleging that PTNNT was in breach of its
    divestiture requirements under the Contract of Work and
    threatening to issue a notice to terminate the Contract of Work
    if PTNNT did not agree to divest the 2006, 2007, and
    2008 shares in accordance with the direction of the DEMR,
    the matter was submitted to an international arbitration panel.
    That panel ruled in March 2009 that the 2006, 2007 and
    2008 shares were required to be transferred by the end of
    September 2009, a deadline that was extended until
    November 23, 2009 by agreement between PTNNT and the
    Indonesian Government. In July 2009, the Company reached
    agreement with the Indonesian government on the price of the
    2008 7% interest and the 2009 7% interest and reoffered the 2008
    7% interest and the 2009 7% interest to the Indonesian
    government at this newly agreed price. In November and December
    2009, sales agreements were concluded pursuant to which the
    2006, 2007, and 2008 shares were transferred to PTMDB and
    2009 shares were committed to be transferred to PTMDB.
    Although the Indonesian government has acknowledged that PTNNT
    is no longer in breach of the Contract of Work, future disputes
    may arise as to the further divestiture of the shares. It is
    uncertain who will acquire any future divestiture shares, and
    the nature of our relations with the new owners of the 2006
    through 2009 shares and any future divestiture shares
    remain uncertain.

As part of the negotiation of the sale agreements with PTMDB,
    the parties executed an operating agreement under which each
    recognizes the right of NTP to operate Batu Hijau and binds the
    parties to adhere to NTP’s standards for safety,
    environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The
    operating agreement becomes effective upon the completion of the
    sale of the 2009 shares and continues for so long as NTP
    owns more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the operating agreement
    terminates, then we will likely lose effective control over the
    operations of Batu Hijau and will be at risk for operations
    conducted in a manner that either detracts from value or results
    in safety, environmental or social standards below those adhered
    to by NTP. Moreover, there have been statements from time to
    time by some within the Indonesian government who advocate
    elimination of Contracts of Work and who may try to instigate
    future disputes surrounding the Contract of Work, particularly
    given that Batu Hijau is one of the largest businesses within
    the country. Although any dispute under the Contract of Work is
    subject to international arbitration, there can be no assurance
    that we would prevail in any such dispute and any termination of
    the Contract of Work could result in substantial diminution in
    the value of our interests in PTNNT.



Our Company
    and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical
    challenges, which could adversely impact our production and
    profitability.

Newmont and the mining industry are facing continued
    geotechnical challenges due to a trend toward mining deeper pits
    and more complex deposits. This leads to higher pit walls, more
    complex underground environments and increased exposure to
    geotechnical instability. As our operations are maturing, the
    open pits at many of our sites are getting deeper and we have
    experienced certain geotechnical failures at some of our mines,
    including, without limitation, in Indonesia at the Batu Hijau
    open-pit mine. In September 2009, our affiliate, PTNNT,
    experienced a geotechnical failure of a portion of the west
    wall. Batu Hijau utilizes an advanced monitoring system that
    measures movement in the pit walls. As a result, no personnel
    were in the pit at the time of the failure and no injuries
    occurred. However, operations were temporarily suspended in
    order to engage in geotechnical review. Following the completion
    of remediation work, mining operations resumed at such location
    again in October 2009. Subsequently, in January 2010, a failure
    also occurred on a portion of the southeast wall causing a
    slide, which regrettably resulted in a fatality of one of the
    mine employees. Operations were temporarily suspended to conduct
    investigations and operations have since recommenced.

No absolute assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse
    geotechnical conditions, such a landslides and pit wall
    failures, will not occur in the future or that such events will
    be detected in advance. Geotechnical instabilities can be
    difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards
    outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable
    rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides and wall
    instability, and seismic activity, which may result in slippage
    of material or mud/topsoil slides.

Geotechnical failures could result in limited or restricted
    access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government
    investigations, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs,
    loss of ore and other impacts, which could cause one or more of
    our projects to be less profitable than currently anticipated
    and could result in a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations and financial condition.

Our operations
    in Peru are subject to political risks.

During the last several years, Yanacocha, in which we own a
    51.35% interest, has been the target of numerous local political
    protests, including ones that blocked the road between the
    Yanacocha mine complex and the City of Cajamarca in Peru. In
    2004, local opposition to the Cerro Quilish project (which is
    located adjacent to Yanacocha) became so pronounced that
    Yanacocha decided to relinquish its drilling permit for Cerro
    Quilish and the deposit was reclassified from proven and
    probable reserves to non-reserve mineralization. In 2006 a road
    blockade was carried out by members of the Combayo community.
    This blockade was unrelated to Cerro Quilish and resulted in a
    brief cessation of mining activities. We cannot predict whether
    similar or more significant incidents will occur and the
    recurrence of significant community opposition or protests could
    adversely affect Yanacocha’s assets and operations. In
    2007, 2008, 2009 and thus far in 2010, no material roadblocks or
    protests occurred involving Yanacocha.

In December 2006, Yanacocha, along with other mining companies
    in Peru, entered into a five-year agreement with the central
    government to contribute 3.75% of net profits to fund social
    development projects. Although the current government has
    generally taken positions promoting private investment, we
    cannot predict future government positions on foreign
    investment, mining concessions, land tenure, environmental
    regulation or taxation. National elections are scheduled in
    April 2011 and a change in government positions on these issues
    could adversely affect Yanacocha’s assets and operations,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
    financial position and results of operations.

Our success
    depends on our social and environmental
    performance.

Our ability to operate successfully in communities around the
    world will likely depend on our ability to develop, operate and
    close mines in a manner that is consistent with the health and
    safety of our employees, the protection of the environment, and
    the creation of long-term economic and social opportunities in
    the communities in which we operate. We have implemented a
    management system



designed to promote continuous improvement in health and safety,
    environmental performance and community relations. However, our
    ability to operate, and thus, our results of operations and our
    financial condition, could be adversely affected by accidents or
    events detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the
    health and safety of our employees, the environment or the
    communities in which we operate.

Remediation
    costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we
    have made.

We have conducted extensive remediation work at two inactive
    sites in the United States. We are conducting mill remediation
    activities at a third site in the United States, an inactive
    uranium mine and mill formerly operated by a subsidiary of
    Newmont, but remediation at the mine is subject to dispute. In
    late 2008 the EPA issued an order regarding water management at
    the mine. The environmental standards that may ultimately be
    imposed at this site remain uncertain and a risk exists that the
    costs of remediation may exceed the financial accruals that have
    been made for such remediation by a material amount. For a more
    detailed discussion of potential environmental liabilities, see
    the discussion in Environmental Matters, Note 33 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes
    known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased,
    the amount of that liability and additional cost will be
    recorded at that time and could materially reduce net income in
    that period.

Currency
    fluctuations may affect our costs.

Currency fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur at our
    operations. Gold and copper is sold throughout the world based
    principally on the U.S. dollar price, but a portion of our
    operating expenses are incurred in local currencies. The
    appreciation of those local currencies against the
    U.S. dollar increases our costs of production in
    U.S. dollar terms at mines located outside the
    United States.

The foreign currency that primarily impacts our results of
    operations is the Australian dollar. We estimate that every
    $0.10 increase in U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange
    rate increases annually the U.S. dollar

Costs applicable
    to sales

by approximately $40 for each ounce of gold
    produced from operations in Australia before taking into account
    the impact of currency hedging. From December 31, 2008 to
    December 31, 2009, the Australian dollar appreciated by
    approximately $0.21 per U.S. dollar, or approximately 30%.
    In mid-2007, we implemented derivative programs to hedge up to
    85% of our future forecasted Australian dollar denominated
    operating and capital expenditures to reduce the variability in
    our Australian dollar denominated expenditures. At
    December 31, 2009 we have hedged 60%, 37% and 13% of our
    forecasted Australian denominated operating costs in 2010, 2011
    and 2012, respectively. Our Australian dollar derivative
    programs will limit the benefit to the Company of future
    decreases if any, in the US dollar/Australian dollar exchange
    rates. For additional information, see Item 7,
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Results of
    Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, below.
    For a more detailed description of how currency exchange rates
    may affect costs, see discussion in Foreign Currency in
    Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions About
    Market Risk.

Our business
    requires substantial capital investment and we may be unable to
    raise additional funding on favorable terms.

The construction and operation of potential future projects
    including the Akyem project in Ghana, the Conga project in Peru,
    the Hope Bay project in Nunavut, Canada, and various exploration
    projects will require significant funding. Our operating cash
    flow and other sources of funding may become insufficient to
    meet all of these requirements, depending on the timing and
    costs of development of these and other projects. As a result,
    new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding
    requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business
    activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service
    significant new sources of capital will be a function of
    macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices, our
    operational performance and our current cash flow and debt
    position, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and
    copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges,
    or a further dislocation in the financial markets as experienced
    in recent years, our ability to pursue new business
    opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our
    ongoing operations, retire or service all outstanding debt and
    pay dividends could be significantly constrained.



Any downgrade
    in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could
    increase our future borrowing costs and adversely affect the
    availability of new financing.

At December 31, 2009 Standard & Poor’s
    Rating Services rated Newmont Mining Corporation BBB+, with a
    stable outlook, and Moody’s Investors Service rated Newmont
    Mining Corporation Baa2 with a stable outlook. There can be no
    assurance that any rating assigned will remain for any given
    period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that
    rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to
    the basis of the rating, so warrant. If we are unable to
    maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels
    acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business
    prospects deteriorate, our ratings could be downgraded by the
    rating agencies, which could adversely affect the value of our
    outstanding securities, our existing debt and our ability to
    obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, and increase
    our borrowing costs, which in turn could impair our results of
    operations and financial condition. See also “Future
    Funding Requirements may Affect our Business” and
    “Current Global Financial Conditions could Adversely Affect
    the Availability of New Financing and our Operations.”

To the extent
    that we seek to expand our operations and increase our reserves
    through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing
    acquisitions or integrating acquired operations.

From time to time, we may examine opportunities to make
    selective acquisitions in order to expand our operations and
    reported reserves. The success of any acquisition would depend
    on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:

•

identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating
    acceptable terms for any such acquisition;

•

obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially
    the Company’s shareholders;

•

maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding
    distraction of management during the process of integrating the
    acquired business;

•

implementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at
    the acquired business; and

•

to the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which
    we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations
    and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any
    acquisitions successfully, or that any acquisition will achieve
    the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any
    material problems that we encounter in connection with such an
    acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, operating results and financial condition.

Our operations
    may be adversely affected by power shortages.

We have periodically experienced power shortages in Ghana
    resulting primarily from drought, increasing demands for
    electricity and insufficient hydroelectric or other generating
    capacity which caused curtailment of production at our Ahafo
    operations. As a result of the mining industry’s initiative
    to construct and install an 80 mega-watt power plant during
    2007, the Ghanaian government has agreed, if required, to
    curtail power consumption as a result of power shortages and to
    distribute available power proportionately between participating
    mines and other industrial and commercial users. Alternative
    sources of power may result in higher than anticipated costs,
    which will affect operating costs. Continued power shortages and
    increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations
    and financial condition.



Occurrence of
    events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flow and
    overall profitability.

We maintain insurance policies that mitigate against certain
    risks related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in
    amounts that we believe are reasonable depending upon the
    circumstances surrounding each identified risk. However, we may
    elect not to have insurance for certain risks because of the
    high premiums associated with insuring those risks or for
    various other reasons; in other cases, insurance may not be
    available for certain risks. Some concern always exists with
    respect to investments in parts of the world where civil unrest,
    war, nationalist movements, political violence or economic
    crises are possible. These countries may also pose heightened
    risks of expropriation of assets, business interruption,
    increased taxation or unilateral modification of concessions and
    contracts. We do not maintain insurance policies against
    political risk. Occurrence of events for which we are not
    insured may affect our results of operations and financial
    position.

Our business
    depends on good relations with our employees.

Due to union activities or other employee actions, we could
    experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions
    in production that could adversely affect us. At
    December 31, 2009 union represented employees constituted
    approximately 54% of our worldwide work force. Currently, there
    are labor agreements in effect for all of these workers. The
    labor agreement for Yanacocha expires on February 28, 2010
    and is currently being

re-negotiated.

There can be no assurance that any future disputes will be
    resolved without disruptions to operations.

Title to some
    of our properties may be defective or challenged.

Although we have conducted title reviews of our properties,
    title review does not necessarily preclude third parties from
    challenging our title or related property rights. While we
    believe that we have satisfactory title to our properties, some
    risk exists that some titles may be defective or subject to
    challenge. In addition, certain of our Australian properties
    could be subject to native title or traditional landowner
    claims, but such claims would not deprive us of the properties.
    For information regarding native title or traditional landowner
    claims, see the discussion under the Australia/New Zealand
    section of Item 2, Properties, below.

Competition
    from other mining companies may harm our business.

We compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key
    executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We
    compete with other mining companies for the services of skilled
    personnel and contractors and for specialized equipment,
    components and supplies, such as drill rigs, necessary for
    exploration and development. We also compete with other mining
    companies for rights to mine properties containing gold and
    other minerals. We may be unable to continue to attract and
    retain skilled and experienced employees, to obtain the services
    of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or
    supplies, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties.

Our ability to
    recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on
    future cash flows and taxable income.

We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax
    assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than
    not of being realized, otherwise, a valuation allowance is
    applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the
    recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to
    make significant estimates related to expectations of future
    taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on
    forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of
    existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that
    future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from
    estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could
    be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could
    limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented
    by our deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2009 the
    Company’s current and long-term deferred tax assets were
    $215 and $937, respectively.



Returns for
    investments in pension plans are uncertain.

We maintain pension plans for certain employees which provide
    for specified payments after retirement. The ability of the
    pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our
    funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the
    plans. Returns, if any, on investments are subject to
    fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions.
    A sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could
    require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than
    anticipated. During the second half of 2008 and early 2009, the
    value of the investments in our pension plans decreased
    significantly. While the plans have sufficient assets to meet
    benefit payments in the near term, the plans are underfunded for
    purposes of long-term sustainable payout to all employees.
    During the later part of 2009, the value of the investments in
    our pension plans improved, but not to the mid-2008 levels. If
    the plan investment values do not recover sufficiently, we may
    be required to increase the amount of future cash contributions.
    For a more detailed discussion of the funding status and
    expected benefit payments to plan participants, see the
    discussion in Employee-Related Benefits, Note 22 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

North
    America

Nevada, USA.

We have been mining gold in
    Nevada since 1965. Nevada operations include Carlin, located
    west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the
    Carlin Trend, the Phoenix mine, located 10 miles south of
    Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately
    15 miles north of Golconda, and the Midas mine near the
    town of the same name. We also participate in the Turquoise
    Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold
    Corporation (“Barrick”), which utilizes mill capacity
    at Twin Creeks.



Gold sales from Nevada totaled approximately 2.0 million
    ounces for 2009 with ore mined from eight open pit and six
    underground mines. At December 31, 2009 we reported
    28.5 million equity ounces of gold reserves in Nevada, with
    84% of those ounces in open pit mines and 16% in underground
    mines. We are pursuing several development opportunities in
    Nevada with significant reserve expansion potential.

The Nevada operations produce gold from a variety of ore types
    requiring different processing techniques depending on economic
    and metallurgical characteristics. To ensure the best use of
    processing capacity, we use a linear programming model to guide
    the flow of both mining sequence selection and routing of ore
    streams to various plants. Refractory ores, which require more
    complex, higher cost processing methods, generated 77% of
    Nevada’s gold production in 2009, compared with 72% in
    2008, and 75% in 2007. With respect to remaining reserves, we
    estimate that approximately 82% are refractory ores and 18% are
    oxide ores. Higher-grade oxide ores are processed by
    conventional milling and cyanide leaching at Carlin (Mill
    5) and Twin Creeks (Juniper). Lower-grade material with
    suitable cyanide solubility is treated on heap leach pads at
    Carlin and Twin Creeks. Higher-grade refractory ores are
    processed through either a roaster at Carlin (Mill 6) or
    autoclaves at Twin Creeks (Sage). Lower-grade refractory ores
    are processed at Carlin by either bio-oxidation/flotation or
    direct flotation at Mill 5. Mill 5 flotation concentrates are
    then processed at the Carlin roaster or the Twin Creeks
    autoclaves and additional gold is recovered from the flotation
    tails by cyanide leaching. The Phoenix mill produces a gravity
    gold concentrate and a copper/gold flotation concentrate and
    recovers additional gold from cyanide leaching of the flotation
    tails. Ore from the Midas mine is processed by conventional
    milling and Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation. Activated carbon
    from the various leaching circuits is treated to produce gold
    ore at the Carlin or Twin Creeks refineries. Zinc precipitate at
    Midas is refined

on-site.

We own, or control through long-term mining leases and
    unpatented mining claims, all of the minerals and surface area
    within the boundaries of the present Nevada mining operations
    (except for the Turquoise Ridge joint venture described below).
    The long-term leases extend for at least the anticipated mine
    life of those deposits. With respect to a significant portion of
    the Gold Quarry mine at Carlin, we own a 10% undivided interest
    in the mineral rights and lease the remaining 90%, on which we
    pay a royalty equivalent to 18% of the mineral production. We
    wholly-own or control the remainder of the Gold Quarry mineral
    rights, in some cases subject to additional royalties. With
    respect to certain smaller deposits in Nevada, we are obligated
    to pay royalties on production to third parties that vary from
    1% to 8% of production.

We have a 25% interest in a joint venture with Barrick in the
    Turquoise Ridge mine. Newmont has an agreement to provide up to
    2,000 tons per day of milling capacity at Twin Creeks to the
    joint venture. Barrick is the operator of the joint venture.
    Gold sales of 39,000 ounces in 2009, 50,100 ounces in 2008 and
    62,800 ounces in 2007 were attributable to Newmont, based on our
    25% ownership interest.

We have ore sale agreements with Barrick and Yukon-Nevada Gold
    Corporation (“Yukon-Nevada”) to process the
    Company’s ore. We recognized attributable gold sales, net
    of treatment charges, of 700 ounces in 2009, 8,000 ounces in
    2008 and 58,600 ounces in 2007, pursuant to these agreements.
    During 2008, Yukon-Nevada discontinued operations; however,
    during the second half of 2009, they resumed operations on a
    limited basis.

We have sales and refining agreements with Gerald Metals,
    Peñoles, Johnson Matthey, Just Refiners and Glencore to
    process intermediate gold bearing product.

Mexico.

We have a 44% interest in
    La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora
    desert. La Herradura is operated by Fresnillo PLC (which
    owns the remaining 56% interest) and comprises open pit
    operations with

run-of-mine

heap leach processing. La Herradura sold 112,500 ounces of
    gold attributable to Newmont in 2009 and at December 31,
    2009 we reported 1.8 million equity ounces of gold reserves
    at La Herradura. La Herradura is currently developing
    two new deposits, Soledad and Dipolos, for production scheduled
    to begin in 2010.

Hope Bay, Canada.

We own 100% of the Hope Bay
    project, a large undeveloped gold project in the Nunavut
    Territory of Canada. Since acquiring this property in early
    2008, we have made significant



infrastructure improvements and identified an additional 45 new
    drilling targets. The Company is currently evaluating an
    underground operation to advance production.

Yanacocha, Peru.

The properties of Minera
    Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) are located
    approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and
    30 miles (48 kilometers) north of the city of Cajamarca, in
    Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993. We hold a 51.35%
    interest in Yanacocha with the remaining interests held by
    Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A.
    (“Buenaventura”) (43.65%) and the International
    Finance Corporation (5%).

Yanacocha has mining rights with respect to a large land
    position consisting of concessions granted by the Peruvian
    government to Yanacocha and a related entity. These mining
    concessions provide for both the right to explore and exploit.
    However, Yanacocha must first obtain the respective exploration
    and exploitation permits, which are generally granted in due
    course. Yanacocha may retain mining concessions indefinitely by
    paying annual fees and, during exploitation, complying with
    production obligations or paying assessed fines. Mining
    concessions are freely assignable or transferable.

Yanacocha currently has three active open pit mines, Cerro
    Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha. Reclamation

and/or

backfilling activities at Carachugo, San José and
    Maqui Maqui are currently underway. Yanacocha has four leach
    pads, three processing facilities, and one mill, which began
    commercial production in the second quarter of 2008.
    Yanacocha’s gold sales for 2009 totaled 2.1 million
    ounces (1.1 million equity ounces) and at December 31,
    2009 we reported 5.4 million equity ounces of gold reserves
    at Yanacocha.

Yanacocha, along with other mining companies in Peru, agreed
    with the central government in December 2006 to contribute 3.75%
    of its net profits to fund social development projects for a
    period of up to five years, contingent upon metal prices
    remaining high.

Conga, Peru.

The Conga project (51.35% owned)
    is located within close proximity of existing operations at
    Yanacocha. Feasibility studies on our preferred development
    option were completed in late 2009 and a construction decision
    is expected in the fourth quarter of 2010 assuming government
    approval. The project is progressing into the development stage
    with production expected in late 2014 to 2015. At
    December 31, 2009 we reported 6.1 million equity
    ounces of gold reserves and 1,660 million equity pounds of
    copper reserves at Conga.

Australia/New Zealand.

In Australia, mineral
    exploration and mining titles are granted by the individual
    states or territories. Mineral titles may also be subject to
    native title legislation or, in the Northern Territory, to
    Aboriginal freehold title legislation that entitles indigenous
    persons to compensation calculated by reference to the gross
    value of production. In 1992, the High Court of Australia held
    that Aboriginal people who have maintained a continuing
    connection with their land according to their traditions and
    customs may hold certain rights in respect of the land (such
    rights commonly referred to as “native title”). Since
    the High Court’s decision, Australia has passed legislation
    providing for the protection of native title and established
    procedures for Aboriginal people to claim these rights. The fact
    that native title is claimed with respect to an area, however,
    does not necessarily mean that native title exists, and disputes
    may be resolved by the courts.

Generally, under native title legislation, all mining titles
    granted before January 1, 1994 are valid. Titles granted
    between January 1, 1994 and December 23, 1996,
    however, may be subject to invalidation if they were not
    obtained in compliance with applicable legislative procedures,
    though subsequent legislation has validated some of these
    titles. After December 23, 1996, mining titles over areas
    where native title is claimed to exist became subject to
    legislative processes that generally give native title claimants
    the “right to negotiate” with the title applicant for
    compensation and other



conditions. Native title holders do not have a veto over the
    granting of mining titles, but if agreement cannot be reached,
    the matter can be referred to the National Native
    Title Tribunal for decision.

We do not expect that native title claims will have a material
    adverse effect on any of our operations in Australia. The High
    Court of Australia determined in an August 2002 decision, which
    refined and narrowed the scope of native title, that native
    title does not subsist in minerals in Western Australia and that
    the rights granted under a mining title would, to the extent
    inconsistent with asserted native title rights, operate to
    extinguish those native title rights. Generally, native title is
    only an issue for Newmont with respect to obtaining new mineral
    titles or moving from one form of title to another, for example,
    from an exploration title to a mining title. In these cases, the
    requirements for negotiation and the possibility of paying
    compensation may result in delay and increased costs for mining
    in the affected areas. Similarly, the process of conducting
    Aboriginal heritage surveys to identify and locate areas or
    sites of Aboriginal cultural significance can result in
    additional costs and delay in gaining access to land for
    exploration and mining-related activities.

In Australia, various ad valorem royalties are paid to state and
    territorial governments, typically based on a percentage of
    gross revenues and earnings.

Boddington.

Boddington (100% owned) is located
    81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Perth in Western
    Australia. Boddington has been wholly owned since June 2009 when
    Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold
    Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington
    poured its first gold on September 30, 2009, commenced
    commercial production in November 2009 and expects a
    12 month

ramp-up

period to design capacity. Boddington sold 103,300 ounces of
    gold, including 8,200 incremental

start-up

ounces, and 9.0 million pounds of copper and at
    December 31, 2009 we reported 21.0 million equity gold
    ounces and 2,040 million equity copper pounds of reserves
    at Boddington.

Jundee.

Jundee (100% owned) is situated
    approximately 435 miles (700 kilometers) northeast of Perth
    in Western Australia. We mined ore at Jundee solely from
    underground sources in 2009, with mill feed supplemented from
    oxide stockpiles for blending purposes. Jundee sold 412,300
    ounces of gold in 2009 and at December 31, 2009 we reported
    1.2 million equity ounces of gold reserves at Jundee.

Kalgoorlie.

Kalgoorlie (50% owned) comprises
    the Fimiston open pit (commonly referred to as the Super Pit)
    and Mt. Charlotte underground mine at Kalgoorlie-Boulder,
    373 miles (600 kilometers) east of Perth in Western
    Australia. The mines are managed by Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold
    Mines Pty Ltd for the joint venture owners, Newmont and Barrick.
    The Super Pit is one of Australia’s largest gold mines in
    terms of gold production and annual mining volume. During 2009,
    the Kalgoorlie operations sold 335,800 equity ounces of gold and
    at December 31, 2009 we reported 4.2 million equity
    ounces of gold reserves at Kalgoorlie.

Tanami.

Tanami (100% owned) includes the
    Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which
    are located in the Northern Territory approximately
    342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs,
    adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead Bullock Soak mining
    operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of
    the Granites. Operations are predominantly focused on the Callie
    underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed
    through the Granites treatment plant. During 2009, the Tanami
    operations sold 290,900 ounces of gold and at December 31,
    2009 we reported 1.6 million equity ounces of gold reserves
    at Tanami.

Waihi.

Waihi (100% owned) is located within
    the town of Waihi, approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers)
    southeast of Auckland, New Zealand and consists of the Favona
    underground deposit and the Martha open pit. The Waihi operation
    sold 118,200 ounces of gold in 2009 and at December 31,
    2009 we reported 0.4 million equity ounces of gold reserves
    at Waihi.

Batu Hijau, Indonesia.

Batu Hijau is located
    on the island of Sumbawa, approximately 950 miles (1,529
    kilometers) east of Jakarta. Batu Hijau is a large porphyry
    copper/gold deposit, which Newmont discovered in 1990.
    Development and construction activities began in 1997 and

start-up

occurred in



late 1999. In 2009, copper sales were 497.7 million pounds
    (217.0 million equity pounds), while gold sales were
    550,500 ounces (239,700 equity ounces) and at December 31,
    2009 we reported 4,520 million equity pounds of copper
    reserves and 4.5 million equity ounces of gold reserves at
    Batu Hijau.

We own 35.44% of the Batu Hijau mine through the Nusa Tenggara
    Partnership (“NTP”) with an affiliate of Sumitomo
    Corporation of Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTP and the
    Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTP in turn owns
    63% of PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT”), the
    Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. In December 2009,
    Newmont entered into a transaction with P.T. Pukuafu Indah
    (“PTPI”), an unrelated noncontrolling partner of
    PTNNT, whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTPI in
    exchange for a pledge of the noncontrolling partner’s 20%
    share of PTNNT dividends, net of withholding tax, and the
    assignment of its voting rights to the Company. As a result,
    PTPI was determined to be a Variable Interest Entity
    (“VIE”) as it has minimal equity capital and the
    voting rights to its 20% interest in PTNNT reside with Newmont.
    As a result, our effective economic interest in PTNNT increased
    by 17% to 52.44% at December 31, 2009. The remaining 17%
    interest in PTNNT is owned by PTMDB, a consortium comprised of
    regional and local governments near the Batu Hijau mine, and PT
    Multicapital, an unrelated Indonesia company. We are currently
    the operator of Batu Hijau.

In Indonesia, rights are granted to foreign investors to explore
    for and to develop mineral resources within defined areas
    through Contracts of Work entered into with the Indonesian
    government. In 1986, PTNNT entered into a Contract of Work with
    the Indonesian government covering Batu Hijau, under which PTNNT
    was granted the exclusive right to explore in the contract area,
    construct any required facilities, extract and process the
    mineralized materials, and sell and export the minerals
    produced, subject to certain requirements including Indonesian
    government approvals and payment of royalties to the government.
    Under the Contract of Work, PTNNT has the right to continue
    operating the project for 30 years from operational

start-up,

or
    longer if approved by the Indonesian government.

Under the Contract of Work executed in 1986 between the
    Indonesian government and PTNNT, beginning in 2006 and
    continuing through 2010, a portion of PTNNT’s shares must
    be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or,
    second, to Indonesian nationals, such portion equal to the
    difference between the following percentages and the percentage
    of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or
    Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 23% by
    March 31, 2006; 30% by March 31, 2007; 37% by
    March 31, 2008; 44% by March 31, 2009; and 51% by
    March 31, 2010. The price at which such interest must be
    offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of the
    then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares would
    be accepted for listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or the
    fair market value of such interest as a going concern, as agreed
    with the Indonesian government. Pursuant to this provision, the
    ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine’s proven and
    probable equity reserves may be reduced in the future to as low
    as 27.56% and ownership interest of NTP in PTNNT could be
    reduced to 49%, thus reducing our ability to control the
    operation at Batu Hijau. In addition to affecting our level of
    control over operations over PTNNT, such loss of control may
    cause us to deconsolidate PTNNT for accounting purposes, which
    would reduce our reported consolidated sales, cost applicable to
    sales, amortization, total assets and operating cash flow
    attributable to PTNNT. See Note 32 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

PTPI has owned and continues to own a 20% interest in PTNNT, and
    therefore NTP (the Newmont-Sumitomo partnership) was required to
    offer a 3% interest in PTNNT for sale in 2006 and an additional
    7% interest in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009. In accordance with
    the Contract of Work, an offer to sell a 3% interest was made to
    the Indonesian government in 2006 and an offer for an additional
    7% interest was made in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009. Following
    notifications from the Department of Energy and Mineral
    Resources (the “DEMR”) alleging that PTNNT was in
    breach of its divestiture requirements under the Contract of
    Work and threatening to issue a notice to terminate the Contract
    of Work if PTNNT did not agree to divest the 2006, 2007 and
    2008 shares in accordance with the direction of the DEMR,
    the matter was submitted to an international arbitration panel.
    That panel ruled in March 2009 that the 2006, 2007 and
    2008 shares were required to be transferred by



the end of September 2009, a deadline that was extended until
    November 23, 2009 by agreement between PTNNT and the
    Indonesian Government. In July 2009, the Company reached
    agreement with the Indonesian government on the price of the
    2008 7% interest and the 2009 7% interest and reoffered the 2008
    7% interest and the 2009 7% interest to the Indonesian
    government at this newly agreed price. In November and December
    2009, sales agreements were concluded pursuant to which the
    2006, 2007, and 2008 shares were transferred to PTMDB and
    2009 shares were committed to be transferred to PTMDB.
    Although the Indonesian government has acknowledged that PTNNT
    is no longer in breach of the Contract of Work, future disputes
    may arise as to the further divestiture of the shares. It is
    uncertain who will acquire any future divestiture shares, and
    the nature of our relations with the new owners of the

2006-2009 shares

and any future divestiture shares remain uncertain.

As part of the negotiation of the sale agreements with PTMDB,
    the parties executed an operating agreement under which each
    recognizes the right of NTP to operate Batu Hijau and binds the
    parties to adhere to NTP’s standards for safety,
    environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The
    operating agreement becomes effective upon the completion of the
    sale of the 2009 shares and continues for so long as NTP
    owns more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the operating agreement
    terminates, then we will likely lose effective control over the
    operations of Batu Hijau and will be at risk for operations
    conducted in a manner that either detracts from value or results
    in safety, environmental or social standards below those adhered
    to by NTP.

The forest use permit was received on September 1, 2009 and
    the permit renewal is valid until 2025. We have been in
    discussions with the Indonesian government to obtain an
    additional forest use permit necessary to make certain
    amendments to the Batu Hijau environmental management plan and
    environmental monitoring plan, including modifications with
    respect to the mine’s pit slope stability. These permits
    are key requirements to continue to operate Batu Hijau
    efficiently and to the ultimate life of the mine and
    recoverability of reserves. However, the additional forest use
    permit has not been received as of the date of this Annual
    Report. No assurances can be made regarding when or whether the
    permit and any related plan amendments will be approved. The
    resulting delay may adversely impact the Batu Hijau mine plan,
    and may adversely impact future operating and financial results,
    including deferment or cancellation of future development and
    operations.

Ahafo.

Ahafo (100% owned) is located in the
    Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290
    kilometers) northwest of Accra. We currently operate three open
    pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 17 pits. Development of
    a fourth pit, Amoma, is underway and production is expected to
    begin in late 2010. The process plant consists of a conventional
    mill and

carbon-in-leach

circuit. Ahafo sold 546,400 ounces of gold in 2009 and at
    December 31, 2009 we reported 9.1 million equity
    ounces of gold reserves at Ahafo.

In December 2003, Ghana’s Parliament unanimously ratified
    an Investment Agreement between Newmont and the Government of
    Ghana. The Agreement establishes a fixed fiscal and legal
    regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of
    any Newmont project in Ghana. Under the Agreement, we will pay
    corporate income tax at the Ghana statutory tax rate (presently
    25% but not to exceed 32.5%) and fixed gross royalties on gold
    production of 3.0% (3.6% for any production from forest reserve
    areas). The Government of Ghana is also entitled to receive 10%
    of a project’s net cash flow after we have recouped our
    investment and may acquire up to 20% of a project’s equity
    at fair market value on or after the 15th anniversary of such
    project’s commencement of production. The Investment
    Agreement also contains commitments with respect to job training
    for local Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local
    goods and services and environmental protection. In 2009 the
    Minister of Finance implemented the National Fiscal
    Stabilization levy, which is an additional tax of profits.
    Negotiations are ongoing with the commissioner of the Ghana
    Internal Revenue Service on the applicability of the levy, given
    Newmont’s Investment Agreement. While negotiations are
    pending, we have paid and included $3 in

Income tax expense

to date under the levy.



Akyem, Ghana.

Akyem (100% owned) is located
    approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra.
    We recently received the Environmental Permit and the Mining
    Lease for Akyem and we are advancing the project towards a
    development decision in the second half of 2010, which could
    result in production in late 2013 to 2014. At December 31 2009
    we reported 7.7 million equity ounces of gold reserves at
    Akyem.

Proven and
    Probable Equity Reserves

We had proven and probable gold reserves of 91.8 million
    equity ounces at December 31, 2009, calculated at a gold
    price assumption of $800, A$1,000 or NZ$1,200 per ounce,
    respectively. Our 2009 reserves would decline by approximately
    7% (6.6 million ounces), if calculated at a $750 per ounce
    gold price. An increase in the gold price to $850 per ounce
    would increase reserves by approximately 3% (3.1 million
    ounces), all other assumptions remaining constant. For 2008,
    reserves were calculated at a gold price assumption of $725,
    A$850 or NZ$1,000 per ounce, respectively.

At December 31, 2009 our proven and probable gold reserves
    in North America were 30.3 million equity ounces. Outside
    of North America, year-end proven and probable gold reserves
    were 61.5 million equity ounces, including
    32.9 million equity ounces in Asia Pacific,
    16.8 million equity ounces in Africa and 11.8 million
    equity ounces in South America.

Our proven and probable copper reserves at December 31,
    2009 were 9,120 million equity pounds. For 2009, reserves
    were calculated at a copper price assumption of $2.00 or A$2.40
    per pound, respectively, unchanged from 2008.

Under our current mining plans, all of our reserves are located
    on fee property or mining claims or will be depleted during the
    terms of existing mining licenses or concessions, or where
    applicable, any assured renewal or extension periods for such
    licenses or concessions.

Proven and probable equity reserves are based on extensive
    drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from
    which we determined economic feasibility. The price sensitivity
    of reserves depends upon several factors including grade,
    metallurgical recovery, operating cost,

waste-to-ore

ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending
    on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the
    production process used. The reserve tables below list the
    average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which
    takes into account the several different processing



methods that we use. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of
    mineralized material considered economic to process, varies with
    material type, metallurgical recoveries, operating costs and co-
    or by-product credits.

The proven and probable equity reserve figures presented herein
    are estimates based on information available at the time of
    calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels
    of recovery of gold and copper will be realized. Ounces of gold
    or pounds of copper included in the proven and probable reserves
    are calculated without regard to any losses during metallurgical
    treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on
    actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold and
    copper, as well as increased production costs or reduced
    metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and
    probable reserves containing relatively lower grades of
    mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a
    reduction of reserves.

We publish reserves annually, and we will recalculate reserves
    at December 31, 2010, taking into account metal prices,
    changes, if any, in future production and capital costs,
    divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and
    additions to reserves during 2010.



The following tables detail gold proven and probable equity
    reserves(1) reflecting only those reserves owned by Newmont at

ITEM 5.

MARKET
    FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
    AND ISSUER PURCHASE OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is listed and principally traded on the New
    York Stock Exchange (under the symbol “NEM”) and is
    also listed in the form of CHESS Depositary Interests
    (“CDIs”) (under the symbol “NEM”) on the
    Australian Stock Exchange (“ASX”). In Australia,
    Newmont is referred to as “Newmont Mining Corporation ARBN
    099 065 997 organized in Delaware with limited liability.”
    Since July 1, 2002, Newmont CDIs have traded on the ASX as
    a Foreign Exempt Listing granted by the ASX, which provides an
    ancillary trading facility to Newmont’s primary listing on
    NYSE.

Holders of Australia CDIs were notified on November 9, 2009
    that Newmont had elected to suspend the CDIs from trading on the
    ASX on February 10, 2010 and to delist the CDIs at
    February 17, 2010. The election was made in light of the
    relatively low volume of Newmont CDIs now traded on the ASX in
    comparison with other exchanges on which Newmont shares may be
    traded, and the fact that investors in Australia seeking to
    trade in Newmont common stock no longer must hold CDIs but may
    instead trade in common shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
    Following the delisting in February 2010, CDI holders can
    convert their CDIs to the underlying Newmont common stock or
    participate in a voluntary share sale facility of the underlying
    Newmont common stock. If the CDI holders take no action the
    underlying Newmont common stock will be sold in a compulsory
    sale following the expiration of the voluntary share sale
    facility.

Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited’s exchangeable
    shares (“Exchangeable Shares”) are listed on the
    Toronto Stock Exchange (under the symbol “NMC”).

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the
    closing high and low sales prices per share of Newmont’s
    common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange
    Composite Tape.

On February 17, 2010, there were outstanding
    483,029,539 shares of Newmont’s common stock
    (including shares represented by CDIs), which were held by
    approximately 13,818 stockholders of record. A dividend of $0.10
    per share of common stock outstanding was declared in each
    quarter of 2009 and 2008, for a total of $0.40 during each year.

The determination of the amount of future dividends will be made
    by Newmont’s Board of Directors from time to time and will
    depend on Newmont’s future earnings, capital requirements,
    financial condition and other relevant factors.

On February 17, 2010, there were outstanding 7,957,841
    Exchangeable Shares, which were held by 43 holders of record.
    The Exchangeable Shares are exchangeable at the option of the
    holders into Newmont common stock. Holders of Exchangeable
    Shares are therefore entitled to receive dividends equivalent to
    those that Newmont declares on its common stock.

No shares or other units of any class of Newmont’s equity
    securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, were purchased by the Company,
    or any affiliated purchaser, during the period October 1,
    2009 to December 31, 2009.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share,
    per ounce and per pound amounts)

The following discussion provides information that management
    believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the
    consolidated financial condition and results of operations of
    Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively,
    “Newmont,” the “Company,” “our”
    and “we”). We use certain non-GAAP financial
    performance measures in our MD&A. For a detailed
    description of each of the non-GAAP measures used in this
    MD&A, please see the discussion under
    “Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures”
    beginning on page 78. References to “A$” refer to
    Australian currency, “C$” to Canadian currency,
    “NZ$” to New Zealand currency, “IDR” to
    Indonesian currency and “$” to United States currency.

This discussion addresses matters we consider important for an
    understanding of our financial condition and results of
    operations at and for the three years ended December 31,
    2009, as well as our future results. It consists of the
    following subsections:

•

“Overview,”

which provides a brief summary of
    our consolidated results and financial position and the primary
    factors affecting those results, as well as a summary of our
    expectations for 2010;

•

“Accounting Developments,”

which provides a
    discussion of recent changes to our accounting policies that
    have affected our consolidated results and financial position;

•

“Critical Accounting Policies,”

which provides
    an analysis of the accounting policies we consider critical
    because of their effect on the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, income

and/or

expenses in our consolidated financial statements

and/or

because they require difficult, subjective or complex judgments
    by our management;

•

“Consolidated Financial Results,”

which
    includes a discussion of our consolidated financial results for
    the last three years;

•

“Results of Consolidated Operations,”

which
    provides an analysis of the regional operating results for the
    last three years;

•

“Liquidity and Capital Resources,”

which
    contains a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, investing
    activities and financing activities, contractual obligations and
    off-balance sheet arrangements; and

•

“Non-GAAP Financial Measures,”

which
    includes descriptions of the various non-GAAP financial
    performance measures used by management, the reasons for their
    usage and a tabular reconciliation of these measures to the
    closest equivalent US GAAP measure.

This item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
    financial statements and the notes thereto included in this
    annual report.

Consolidated
    Financial Performance

Gold revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due
    to an increase in the average realized price and consolidated
    ounces sold. Gold sales increased to 6.5 million ounces in
    2009 from 6.2 million ounces in 2008, primarily due to the

start-up

of
    Boddington and higher production at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau,
    partially offset by lower production in Nevada. Copper revenues
    increased in 2009 from 2008 due to higher sales volume at Batu
    Hijau and the

start-up

of
    Boddington. In addition, our 2009 financial and operating
    results were impacted by the following:

•

Boddington acquisition costs and revaluation of contingent
    consideration ($90, pre-tax);

•

Advanced projects, research and development expense ($135,
    primarily at Boddington, Hope Bay, Nevada growth and Ghana
    investments); and

•

Loss on the sale of the Kori Kollo operations ($43, pre-tax).

Looking
    Forward

Certain key factors will affect our future financial and
    operating results. These include, but are not limited to, the
    following:

•

Fluctuations in gold and copper prices;

•

We expect 2010 consolidated gold production of approximately 6.3
    to 6.8 million ounces, primarily as a result of the

ramp-up

of
    Boddington, partially offset by lower production at Nevada and
    Yanacocha;

•

Costs applicable to sales — gold

for 2010 are
    expected to be approximately $450 to $480 per ounce due to
    higher energy costs, labor and contracted services and lower
    expected production at Nevada and Yanacocha;

•

We expect 2010 consolidated copper production of approximately
    540 to 600 million pounds at

Costs applicable to sales

of approximately $0.85 to $0.95 per pound;

•

We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1,400 to
    $1,600 in 2010, with approximately 30% invested in each of the
    North America and Asia Pacific regions and the remaining 40% at
    other locations. Approximately 60% of the 2010 capital budget is
    allocated to sustaining investments, with the remaining 40%
    allocated to project development, including the development of
    the Akyem project in Ghana and the Conga project in Peru;

•

We expect 2010 exploration expenditures of approximately $190 to
    $220 and 2010 advanced projects, research and development
    expenditures of approximately $185 to $210;

•

Our 2010 expectations, particularly with respect to production
    volumes and

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce or pound,
    may differ significantly from actual quarter and full year
    results due to variations in mine planning and sequencing, ore
    grades and hardness, metal recoveries, waste removal, commodity
    input prices and foreign currency exchange rates; and

•

Potential future investments in the Hope Bay project in Canada,
    the Akyem project in Ghana and the Conga project in Peru will
    require significant funding. Our operating cash flow may become
    insufficient to meet the funding requirements of these
    investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay
    dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new
    sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic
    conditions, future gold and copper prices and our operational
    performance, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and
    copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges,
    or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business
    opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our
    ongoing business activities and pay dividends could be
    significantly constrained.

Accounting
    Developments

For a discussion of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
    and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements see Note 2 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are
    critical to our financial statements due to the degree of
    uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and
    the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being
    reported.

Carrying Value
    of Goodwill

At December 31, 2009, the carrying value of goodwill was
    approximately $188. Goodwill represents the excess of the
    aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable
    net assets. Goodwill was assigned to various mine site reporting
    units in the Asia Pacific Segment. Our approach to allocating
    goodwill was to identify those reporting units that we believed
    had contributed



to such excess purchase price. We then performed valuations to
    measure the incremental increases in the fair values of such
    reporting units that were attributable to the acquisitions, and
    that were not already captured in the fair values assigned to
    such units’ identifiable net assets.

We evaluate, on at least an annual basis during the fourth
    quarter, the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether
    current events and circumstances indicate that such carrying
    amount may no longer be recoverable. To accomplish this, we
    compare the estimated fair value of our reporting units to their
    carrying amounts. If the carrying value of a reporting unit
    exceeds its estimated fair value, we compare the implied fair
    value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying
    amount, and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value
    is charged to earnings. Our fair value estimates are based on
    numerous assumptions and it is possible that actual fair value
    will be significantly different than the estimates, as actual
    future quantities of recoverable minerals, gold and other
    commodity prices, production levels, operating costs and capital
    requirements are each subject to significant risks and
    uncertainties.

Mine Site
    Goodwill

The assignment of goodwill to mine site reporting units was
    based on synergies that have been incorporated into our
    operations and business plans over time. The amount of goodwill
    assigned to each segment or reporting unit was based on
    discounted cash flow analyses that assumed risk-adjusted
    discount rates over the remaining lives of the applicable mining
    operations. We believe that triggering events with respect to
    the goodwill assigned to mine site reporting units could
    include, but are not limited to: (i) a significant decrease
    in our long-term gold and copper price assumptions; (ii) a
    decrease in reserves; (iii) a significant reduction in the
    estimated fair value of mine site exploration potential; and
    (iv) any event that might otherwise adversely affect mine
    site production levels or costs. We performed our annual
    impairment test of mine site goodwill at December 31, 2009
    and determined that the fair value of each mine site reporting
    unit was in excess of the relevant carrying value at
    December 31, 2009. For more information on the discounted
    cash flows used to value mine site reporting units, see Carrying
    Value of Long-Lived Assets, below.

Exploration
    Segment Goodwill

In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Exploration Segment was
    impaired and the full value of goodwill was written-off. The
    Exploration Segment was responsible for all activities, whether
    near-mine or greenfield, associated with our efforts to discover
    new mineralized material that could ultimately advance into
    proven and probable reserves. As discussed in greater detail
    below, when performing our Exploration Segment goodwill
    impairment testing, we used historic additions to proven and
    probable reserves as an indication of the expected future
    performance of the Exploration Segment.

The Exploration Segment’s valuation model attributed all
    cash flows expected to be derived from future greenfield
    exploration discoveries, to the Exploration Segment. The
    valuation model included management’s best estimates of
    future reserve additions from exploration activities and all
    revenues and costs associated with their discovery, development
    and production. Historical proven and probable reserve
    additions, excluding acquisitions, were used as an indicator of
    the Exploration Segment’s ability to discover additional
    reserves in the future. The valuation model assumed that we
    would be able to perpetually develop and produce the assumed
    additions to proven and probable reserves from future
    discoveries at existing or new mine site reporting units. Actual
    reserve additions have varied significantly from year to year
    due to the time required to advance a deposit from initial
    discovery to proven and probable reserves and based on the
    timing of when proven and probable reserves can be reported
    under the Securities and Exchange Commission Industry Guide 7.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, we performed an impairment test
    of the Exploration Segment goodwill. Based on the Exploration
    Segment’s historic additions to proven and probable
    reserves and management’s best estimates of future reserve
    additions from exploration activities and all revenues and costs
    associated with their discovery, development and production, the
    Exploration Segment’s



estimated fair value was negligible. The decreased value
    attributable to the Exploration Segment resulted primarily from
    adverse changes in valuation assumptions and the application of
    a revised industry definition of value beyond proven and
    probable reserves (“VBPP”). The changes to valuation
    assumptions included: (i) a significantly lower assumed
    annual reserve growth rate (from 4% to 3%), (ii) a
    significant change in the financial markets resulting in a
    significant increase in the discount rate (from 8% to 10%), and
    (iii) an increase in finding costs due to a combination of
    increased spending and reduced exploration success. The revised
    definition of VBPP ascribes more value to tangible mineral
    interest than the original definition used. As a result of
    applying the new definition of VBPP, the higher value ascribed
    to the Exploration Segment’s tangible mineral interests
    reduced the implied value of the Exploration Segment’s
    goodwill to a negligible value. Based on the negligible
    valuation, the Exploration Segment goodwill was impaired and the
    full $1,122 of goodwill was recorded as a non-cash write-down at
    December 31, 2007.

Merchant
    Banking Goodwill

During June 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan to
    cease Merchant Banking activities, and Merchant Banking was
    subsequently sold in December 2007. Merchant Banking previously
    provided advisory services to assist in managing our portfolio
    of operating and property interests. Merchant Banking was also
    engaged in developing value optimization strategies for
    operating and non-operating assets, business development
    activities, merger and acquisition analysis and negotiations,
    monetizing inactive exploration properties, capitalizing on
    proprietary technology and know-how and acting as an internal
    resource for other corporate groups to improve and maximize
    business outcomes. As a result of the Board’s approval of
    management’s plan to cease Merchant Banking activities, we
    recorded a $1,665 non-cash charge to impair the goodwill
    associated with the Merchant Banking Segment during the second
    quarter of 2007.

Amortization

Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures
    that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment
    are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method at
    rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated
    future lives of such facilities or equipment. These lives do not
    exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable
    reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to
    be limited to the life of the relevant mine.

Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as
    incurred, where it has been determined that the property can be
    economically developed based on the existence of proven and
    probable reserves. At our surface mines, these costs include
    costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to
    initially expose the ore body. At our underground mines, these
    costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking
    and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and
    infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using
    the

units-of-production

(“UOP”) method over the estimated life of the ore body
    based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven
    and probable reserves.

Major development costs incurred after the commencement of
    production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated
    recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable
    reserves. To the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore
    body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces
    or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore
    body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that
    only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are
    amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in
    proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area.

The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore
    the annual amortization charge to operations, could be
    materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the
    future is different from current forecasts of production based
    on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to
    the extent that there were significant changes in any of the
    factors or assumptions used in



determining reserves. These changes could include: (i) an
    expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration
    activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual
    costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery
    rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and
    (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and
    commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves.
    If reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to
    operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased
    significantly, amortization charged to operations would
    decrease. Such changes in reserves could similarly impact the
    useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis,
    where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in
    turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves.

The expected useful lives used in amortization calculations are
    determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as
    described above. Significant judgment is involved in the
    determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given
    that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the
    useful lives assumed for the purpose of amortization
    calculations.

Carrying Value
    of Stockpiles

Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine
    and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured
    by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the
    stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on
    assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates
    (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore
    tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated
    to stockpiles based on relative values of material stockpiled
    and processed using current mining costs incurred up to the
    point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable overhead and
    amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are added to a
    stockpile based on current mining costs and removed at each
    stockpile’s average cost per recoverable ounce of gold or
    pound of copper in the stockpile. Stockpiles are reduced as
    material is removed and processed further. At December 31,
    2009 and 2008, our stockpiles had a total carrying value of
    $1,387 (Batu Hijau, $834; Nevada, $269; Other Australia/New
    Zealand, $121; Boddington, $59; others, $104) and $990 (Batu
    Hijau, $612; Nevada, $214; Other Australia/New Zealand, $95;
    others, $69), respectively.

Costs that are incurred in or benefit from the productive
    process are accumulated as stockpiles. We record stockpiles at
    the lower of average cost or net realizable value
    (“NRV”), and carrying values are evaluated at least
    quarterly. NRV represents the estimated future sales price based
    on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs
    to complete production and bring the product to sale. The
    primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of
    stockpiles include short-term and long-term metals prices and
    costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy,
    materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and
    actual production levels. The significant assumptions in
    determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit at
    December 31, 2009 included production cost and capitalized
    expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, a long-term
    gold price of $900 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $2.50
    per pound and U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of
    $0.80 per A$1.00. If short-term and long-term metals prices
    decrease, the value of the stockpiles decrease, and it may be
    necessary to record a write-down of stockpiles to NRV. During
    2009, 2008 and 2007, write-downs of stockpiles to NRV totaled
    $nil, $2 and $14, respectively.

Cost allocation to stockpiles and the NRV measurement involves
    the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining
    operation regarding current and future operating and capital
    costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices,
    proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and
    other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in
    determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can
    be given that actual results will not differ significantly from
    those estimates and assumptions.



Carrying Value
    of Ore on Leach Pads

Ore on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed
    on leach pads where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the
    surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. Costs are added to ore
    on leach pads based on current mining costs, including
    applicable amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are
    removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on
    the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the
    leach pad.

Estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated
    from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured
    tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the
    leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage
    (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50%
    and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching,
    declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is
    complete.

Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach
    pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on
    pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical
    balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits
    the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result,
    the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and
    estimates are refined based on actual results over time.
    Historically, our operating results have not been materially
    impacted by variations between the estimated and actual
    recoverable quantities of gold on its leach pads. Variations
    between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes
    in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs
    to NRV are accounted for on a prospective basis. The significant
    assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine site reporting
    unit at December 31, 2009 apart from production cost and
    capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation,
    included a long-term gold price of $900 per ounce. If short-term
    and long-term metals prices decrease, the value of the ore on
    leach pads decrease, and it may be necessary to record a
    write-down of ore on leach pads to NRV.

Carrying Value
    of Long-Lived Assets

We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related
    carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An asset impairment is
    considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on
    an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the
    asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is
    measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash
    flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated
    quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other
    commodity prices (considering current and historical prices,
    trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs,
    capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on

life-of-mine

plans. The significant assumptions in determining the NRV for
    each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2009 apart
    from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions
    unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of
    $900 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $2.50 per pound and
    U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $0.80 per
    A$1.00. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded write-downs of
    $7, $137 and $10, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of
    property, plant and mine development.

Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven
    and probable reserves, including mineralization other than
    proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part
    of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are
    included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting
    units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether
    the assets are impaired. The term “recoverable
    minerals” refers to the estimated amount of gold or other
    commodities that will be obtained after taking into account
    losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of
    recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral
    interests are risk adjusted based on management’s relative
    confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows,
    assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are
    identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future
    cash flows from other asset groups.



As discussed above under Amortization, various factors could
    impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production
    schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally,
    production, capital and reclamation costs could differ from the
    assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess
    impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of
    recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests
    involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable
    to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have
    been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the
    identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined
    economically. Assets classified as exploration potential have
    the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset
    can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of
    geological confidence and economic modeling.

Derivative
    Instruments

With the exception of the Call Spread Transactions (as described
    in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), all
    financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative
    are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value. Changes
    in the fair market value of derivatives are recorded in the
    statements of consolidated income (loss), except for the
    effective portion of the change in fair market value of
    derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedge and qualify
    for cash flow hedge accounting. Management applies significant
    judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are
    highly sensitive to assumptions regarding commodity prices,
    market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and
    interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially
    affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the
    changes in fair market value of derivatives. Certain derivative
    contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the
    effective portion of changes in fair market value of these
    instruments are deferred in

Accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss)

and will be recognized in the statements of
    consolidated income (loss) when the underlying transaction
    designated as the hedged item impacts earnings. The derivative
    contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges are designated
    against future foreign currency expenditures or future diesel
    expenditures, where management believes the forecasted
    transaction is probable of occurring. To the extent that
    management determines that such future foreign currency or
    diesel expenditures are no longer probable of occurring, gains
    and losses deferred in

Accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss)

would be reclassified to the statements of
    consolidated income (loss) immediately.

Reclamation
    and Remediation Obligations (Asset Retirement
    Obligations)

Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the
    related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes
    in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of
    time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or
    amount of the reclamation and remediation costs. The asset
    retirement obligation is based on when the spending for an
    existing environmental disturbance will occur. We review, on at
    least an annual basis, the asset retirement obligation at each
    mine site in accordance with guidance for accounting for asset
    retirement obligations.

Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on
    management’s best estimate of the costs expected to be
    incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where
    applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs.
    Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings
    in the period an estimate is revised.

Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires
    management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of
    the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and
    remediation work required to comply with existing laws and
    regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could
    differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to
    environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of
    reclamation and remediation work required. Any such increases in
    future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to
    earnings for reclamation and remediation.



Income and
    Mining Taxes

We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax
    assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than
    not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred
    tax assets requires management to make significant estimates
    related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of
    future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the
    application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer
    above under Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion
    of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from
    estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable
    income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to
    realize deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date
    could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in
    the jurisdictions in which we operate could limit our ability to
    obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax
    assets recorded at the reporting date.

Our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments
    in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple
    jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many
    factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in
    various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from
    federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize
    potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated
    tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions
    based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,
    additional taxes will be due. At January 1, 2007, we
    adopted income tax guidance to record these liabilities (refer
    to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of
    changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity
    of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may
    result in a payment that is materially different from our
    current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax
    liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an
    additional charge to expense would result. If an estimate of tax
    liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a
    tax benefit would result. We recognize interest and penalties,
    if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax
    expense.

Costs applicable to sales — gold

increased in
    2009 compared to 2008 due to higher sales volumes, higher
    royalty and workers participation expenses, partially offset by
    higher by-product sales and lower diesel costs. The increase in
    2008 compared to 2007 was due to higher diesel costs and higher
    royalty and workers participation expenses, partially offset by
    lower waste removal costs at Batu Hijau and higher by-product
    sales.

Costs applicable to sales — copper

decreased in 2009 from 2008 due to lower diesel and mining
    costs, partially offset by higher labor costs and the

start-up

of
    Boddington production. The decrease in 2008 from 2007 was due to
    lower waste removal costs, partially offset by higher diesel,
    labor and milling costs. For a complete discussion regarding
    variations in operations, see

Results of Consolidated
    Operations

below.

Amortization

increased in 2009 from 2008 due to the

start-up

of
    Boddington, higher underground production at Nevada and Jundee,
    development of North Lantern in Nevada, a full year’s
    amortization of Hope Bay infrastructure and higher production at
    Batu Hijau.

Amortization

increased in 2008 from 2007 due
    to increased production at Jundee, Waihi and Ahafo, a larger
    portion of Nevada production being sourced from the Phoenix and
    Leeville operations and the

start-up

of
    the gold mill at Yanacocha and the power plant in Nevada.

Amortization

expense fluctuates as capital expenditures
    increase or decrease and as production levels increase or
    decrease due to the use of the units-of production amortization
    method for mineral interests and mine development. For a
    complete discussion, see



Results of Consolidated Operations

Amortization

to increase to approximately $940 to $970 in

The

Loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales
    contracts

of $531 in 2007 resulted from the elimination of
    the 1.85 million ounces of forward sales contracts that
    would have impacted results in 2008, 2009 and beyond.

Midas redevelopment

of $11 in 2007 resulted from
    activities undertaken, during the period in which operations
    were suspended, to regain entry into the mine in order to resume
    commercial production following a fatal accident that occurred
    in June 2007.

Exploration

decreased to $187 in 2009 from $213 in 2008
    due to a reduced drilling program related to the Company’s
    focus on net cash flow generation and a more selective and
    strategic



exploration program. We expect

Exploration

spending to
    increase to approximately $190 to $220 in 2010.

During 2009, we added 6.4 million equity ounces to proven
    and probable reserves, with 6.8 million equity ounces of
    depletion. Reserve additions of 6.4 million equity ounces
    were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Gold
    Quarry (2.9 million equity ounces), Boddington
    (1.3 million equity ounces), Tanami (0.5 million
    equity ounces) and Ahafo (0.5 million equity ounces) with
    most of the remaining additions coming from open pit and
    underground sources in Australia and South America
    (0.6 million equity ounces). Gold reserves were revised
    down by 0.3 million equity ounces at Phoenix in Nevada,
    primarily due to metallurgy, geology and modeling impacts. The
    estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these
    reserve additions was an increase of 1.7 million equity
    ounces.

During 2008, we added 5.2 million equity ounces to proven
    and probable reserves, with 6.7 million equity ounces of
    depletion. Reserve additions from exploration of
    4.4 million equity ounces were primarily due to conversion
    of mineralized material at Boddington (1.6 million equity
    ounces, 66.67% ownership), with most of the remaining additions
    coming from several open pit and underground sites in Nevada
    (totaling 1.2 million equity ounces) and from underground
    sites in Australia (0.7 million equity ounces). Gold
    reserves were revised down by 1.1 million equity ounces,
    primarily due to metallurgy, geology and modeling impacts at
    Phoenix in Nevada. The impact of the change in gold price
    assumption on reserve additions was an increase of
    1.9 million equity ounces.

During 2007, we added 0.8 million equity ounces to proven
    and probable reserves, with 7.3 million equity ounces of
    depletion. Reserve additions from exploration of
    3.5 million equity ounces were primarily due to further
    extension drilling at Boddington (66.67% ownership), Jundee and
    Tanami in Australia (2.6 million equity ounces), with the
    remaining additions from several opn pit and underground sites
    in Nevada as well as La Herradura in Mexico. The impact of
    the change in gold price assumption on reserve additions was an
    increase of 0.7 million equity ounces.

start-up

of
    Boddington, the Hope Bay gold project in Nunavut, Canada, the
    Akyem gold project in Ghana and the Conga copper and gold



project in Peru. We expect

Advanced projects, research and
    development

spending to be approximately $185 to $210 in
    2010, an increase from 2009, with a focus on the major projects
    above.

General and administrative

expense increased in 2009
    compared to 2008 due to higher benefits, mainly pension and
    other post retirement costs.

General and administrative

expense remained stable over the period from 2007 to 2008.

General and administrative

expense as a percentage of
    revenues was 2.1% in 2009, compared to 2.4% and 2.6% in 2008 and
    2007, respectively. We expect

General and administrative

expenses to be approximately $160 to $170 in 2010.

Write-down of goodwill

in 2007 was $1,122 ($nil for 2009
    and 2008) and was related to the Exploration segment. The
    impairment resulted primarily from adverse changes in valuation
    assumptions and the application of a revised industry definition
    of value beyond proven and probable reserves (“VBPP”).
    The changes to valuation assumptions included: (i) a
    significantly lower assumed annual reserve growth rate (from 4%
    to 3%), (ii) a significant change in the financial markets
    resulting in a significant increase in the discount rate (from
    8% to 10%), and (iii) an increase in finding costs due to a
    combination of increased spending and reduced exploration
    success. The revised definition of VBPP ascribes more value to
    tangible mineral interest than the original definition used by
    the Company. As a result of applying the new definition of VBPP,
    the higher value ascribed to the Exploration Segment’s
    tangible mineral interests reduced the implied value of the
    Exploration Segment’s goodwill to a negligible value.

Write-down of property, plant and mine development

totaled $7, $137 and $10 for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The 2009 write-down primarily related to assets in
    Asia Pacific and South America. The 2008 write-down primarily
    related to mineral interests and other assets in North America
    and Asia Pacific. In North America, the Fort a la Corne JV
    assets were impaired based on 2008 geologic results and
    potential project economics leading to our decision to cease
    funding our share of project development costs. The 2007
    write-down primarily related to assets in Asia Pacific.

For a discussion of our policy for assessing the carrying value
    of goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, see Critical
    Accounting Policies, above.

Other expense, net

was $383, $351 and $243 for 2009, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. The increase of $32, or 9%, in 2009 over
    2008 is due to $90 of costs related to acquiring the remaining
    interest in Boddington, a workforce reduction that impacted 3%
    of our global workforce and an increase in expenses for the
    Western Australian power plant, partially offset by higher
    reclamation estimate revisions in 2008 and the recovery of bad
    debts provided for in 2008. The increase of $108, or 44%, in
    2008 over 2007 primarily relates to reclamation estimate
    revisions for changes in environmental obligation estimates at
    inactive mines including Mt. Leyshon in Australia and the
    Midnite mine in Washington, USA.

Other income, net

was $88, $123 and $100 for 2009, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. The decrease of $35, or 28%, in 2009
    over 2008 is primarily related to a decrease in Canadian Oil
    Sands Trust income due to lower oil prices in 2009 and higher
    gains on sale of investments and exploration properties in 2008,
    partially offset by the impairment of investments in Shore Gold
    Inc. (“Shore”) and Gabriel Resources Ltd.
    (“Gabriel”) in 2008. The increase of $23, or 23%, in
    2008 over 2007 is primarily related to an increase in Canadian
    Oil Sands Trust income due to significantly higher oil prices
    through the majority of 2008 and gains on sales of investments
    and exploration properties in 2008, partially offset by the
    impairment of investments in Shore and Gabriel in 2008.

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest

was $120,
    $135 and $118 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capitalized
    interest totaled $111, $47 and $50 in each year, respectively.
    Interest costs decreased in 2009 primarily due to higher
    capitalized interest, partially offset by additional interest on
    the $900 and $1,100 senior notes issued in September 2009 and
    $518 convertible senior notes issued in February 2009.
    Capitalized interest increased compared to the prior periods due
    to the construction of Boddington. Interest costs increased in
    2008 primarily due to increased borrowings under our revolving
    credit facility and a full year of interest on the $1,150
    convertible senior notes



issued in July 2007, partially offset by the repayment of
    borrowings at Batu Hijau and Australia. We expect

Interest
    expense, net of capitalized interest

to be approximately
    $270 to $290 in 2010 due to lower capitalized interest and
    higher average levels of debt related to the senior notes issued
    in 2009.

Income tax expense

was $788 in 2009, compared to $100 and
    $190 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective tax rates
    were 27%, 8% and (49%) in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Without the restructuring that resulted in a $159 tax benefit in
    2008 and the $1,122 goodwill impairment charge in 2007 (which is
    not deductible for tax purposes and for which no related income
    tax benefit can be claimed), the effective tax rates for 2008
    and 2007 would have been 21% and 26%. The factors that most
    significantly impacted our effective tax rates for the three
    periods are percentage depletion, the rate differential related
    to foreign earnings indefinitely invested, valuation allowances
    related to deferred tax assets, foreign earnings not
    indefinitely reinvested net of foreign tax credits, earnings
    attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and
    affiliated companies, changes in estimates of reserves for
    income tax uncertainties, foreign currency translation gains and
    losses, changes in tax laws, goodwill impairment and the impact
    of certain specific transactions. Many of these factors are
    sensitive to the average realized price of gold and other metals.

Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion
    that may exceed our tax basis in our mineral reserves) are
    available to us under the income tax laws of the United States
    for operations conducted in the United States or through
    branches and partnerships owned by U.S. subsidiaries
    included in our consolidated United States income tax return.
    The deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold and
    other minerals produced by the Company. The tax benefits from
    percentage depletion were $127, $130 and $70 in 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The increase in 2008 compared to 2007
    primarily is due to the increase in gold price.

We operate in various countries around the world that have tax
    laws, tax incentives and tax rates that are significantly
    different than those of the United States. Many of these
    differences combine to move our overall effective tax rate
    higher or lower than the United States statutory rate depending
    on the mix of income relative to income earned in the United
    States. The effect of these differences is shown in Note 8
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements as either a foreign
    rate differential or the effect of foreign earnings, net of
    credits. Differences in tax rates and other foreign income tax
    law variations make our ability to fully utilize all of our
    available foreign income tax credits on a

year-by-year

basis highly dependent on the price of the gold and copper
    produced by the Company and the costs of production, since lower
    prices or higher costs can result in our having insufficient
    sources of taxable income in the United States to utilize all
    available foreign tax credits. Such credits have limited carry
    back and carry forward periods and can only be used to reduce
    the United States income tax imposed on our foreign earnings
    included in our annual United States consolidated income tax
    return. The effects of foreign earnings, net of allowable
    credits, resulted in a decrease in income tax expense of $6 for
    2009 and an increase in income tax expense of $nil and $13 in
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The effect of different income tax
    rates in countries where earnings are indefinitely reinvested
    contributed to a decrease in our income tax expense of $4 for
    2009 and an increase in our income tax expense of $20 and $7 in
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

The tax effect of changes in local country tax laws, as shown in
    our effective tax reconciliation in Note 8 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, resulted in no tax effect in
    2009 and 2008 and a net tax benefit of $4 in 2007. The net tax
    benefit in 2007 is primarily related to a decrease in Canadian
    federal and provincial statutory tax rates and a decrease in New
    Zealand tax rates.

The need to record valuation allowances related to our deferred
    tax assets (primarily attributable to net operating losses and
    tax credits) is principally dependent on the following factors:
    (i) the extent to which the net operating losses and tax
    credits can be carried back and yield a tax benefit;
    (ii) our long-term estimate of future average realized
    minerals prices; and (iii) the degree to which many of the
    tax laws and income tax agreements that apply to us and our
    subsidiaries around the world tend to create significant tax
    deductions early in the mining process. These up-front
    deductions can give rise to net operating losses and tax credit
    carry forwards in circumstances where future sources of



taxable income may not coincide with available carry forward
    periods even after taking into account all available tax
    planning strategies. Furthermore, certain liabilities, accrued
    for financial reporting purposes, may not be deductible for tax
    purposes until such liabilities are actually funded which could
    happen after mining operations have ceased, when sufficient
    sources of taxable income may not be available. Changes to
    valuation allowances decreased income tax expense by $32 and $17
    in 2009 and 2007 and increased income tax expense by $31 in
    2008. The reduction in valuation allowances in 2009 and 2007 are
    a result of the increase in value of certain marketable
    securities investments, and higher forecasted taxable income
    from certain mining operations caused by the increase in the
    average price of gold and the realization of capital loss
    benefits. The valuation allowance also decreased in 2009 as a
    result of a write off of Australian capital losses that had no
    impact on the Company’s effective tax rate. The increase in
    2008 primarily is related to losses recorded on the decrease in
    value of certain marketable securities investments.

We consolidate certain subsidiaries of which we do not own 100%
    of the outstanding equity. However, for tax purposes, we are
    only responsible for the income taxes on the portion of the
    taxable earnings attributable to our ownership interest of each
    consolidated entity. Such noncontrolling interests contributed
    $18, $19 and $4 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as
    reductions in our income tax expense.

Tax expense decreased by $38 and $69 in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, and increased by $3 in 2007 relating to the
    reduction in income taxes resulting from revised estimates of
    reserves for uncertain income tax positions recorded in
    jurisdictions where either the statutes of limitations expired
    or where uncertain income tax positions were settled.

Our tax expense decreased by $21 in 2008 due to the
    U.S. income tax effect of realized translation losses
    attributable to Canadian dollar-denominated debt instruments
    that were converted to equity. Because we intend to indefinitely
    reinvest earnings from Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada
    Limited, the obligor on such debt instruments, no offsetting
    United States deferred income tax effect can be recorded.

During 2008, tax expense decreased by $159 related to
    restructuring the form of one of the Company’s non-US
    subsidiaries. This transaction gave rise to a significant loss
    that allowed the Company to recover income taxes paid in prior
    years.

Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the
    factors influencing our effective tax rate and the sensitivity
    of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed
    above, the effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in
    future periods. The effective tax rate is expected to be between
    28% and 32% in 2010.

    Operations) and divestiture of a portion of Batu Hijau in
    accordance with the provisions of the Contract of Work. The 2008
    decrease from 2007 resulted from lower earnings at Batu Hijau
    partially offset by increased earnings at Yanacocha (see Results

In July 2009, we sold our interest in the Kori Kollo operation
    in Bolivia. As part of the transaction, a reclamation trust fund
    was established with the proceeds to be made available
    exclusively to pay for closure and reclamation costs when
    operations eventually cease. We recorded a $13 liability for the
    trust fund and recognized a $16 charge, net of tax benefits.

In December 2007, we sold substantially all of Pajingo’s
    assets for cash and marketable equity securities totaling $23
    resulting in a gain of $8. Additional Pajingo asset sales
    resulted in a gain of $1 in 2008.

In June 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan to cease
    Merchant Banking activities. As part of this plan, we decided to
    dispose our royalty portfolio assets and a portion of our
    marketable equity securities portfolio and to cease further
    investments in marketable equity securities that do not support
    our core gold mining business. In June 2007, we recorded a
    $1,665 non-cash charge to impair the goodwill associated with
    the Merchant Banking Segment. In December 2007, we received net
    cash proceeds of $1,187 and recognized a gain of $905 related to
    the sale of the royalty portfolio. In 2008, we recognized
    additional royalty portfolio revenue of $6 in excess of our 2007
    estimate and recorded a $19 tax benefit related to the US tax
    return

true-up

on
    the sale of the royalty portfolio.

Our interest in the Zarafshan operation was expropriated by the
    Uzbekistan government in 2006. In 2007, after pursuing
    international arbitration, we received proceeds of $80 and
    recognized a gain of $77 related to the settlement.

Consolidated gold ounces sold increased 6% in 2009 from 2008 due
    to:

•

higher production from Asia Pacific due to higher ore grade and
    throughput at Batu Hijau and the

start-up

of
    Boddington;

•

higher production from South America due to higher mill
    production from higher grade and throughput at Yanacocha;
    partially offset by

•

lower production from North America due to lower grade and lower
    leach placement in Nevada.

Consolidated gold ounces sold increased 1% in 2008 from 2007 due
    to:

•

higher production from South America due to

start-up

of
    milling operations;

•

higher production from Africa due to higher ore grades;
    partially offset by

•

lower production from Asia Pacific due to lower ore grades,
    throughput and recovery at Batu Hijau.

Consolidated copper pounds sold increased 75% in 2009 from 2008
    due to higher ore grades and throughput at Batu Hijau and the

start-up

of
    Boddington. Consolidated copper pounds sold decreased 32% in
    2008 from 2007 due to lower ore grades, throughput and recovery
    at Batu Hijau.



Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated gold ounce
    sold decreased 4% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to higher
    production, lower diesel costs and higher by-product credits
    partially offset by higher royalties and workers participation.

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated gold ounce
    sold increased 12% in 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher
    diesel, royalty and labor costs, partially offset by higher
    by-product sales and lower waste removal costs at Batu Hijau.

Costs applicable to sales

per consolidated copper pound
    decreased 54% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to higher copper
    production, lower waste removal costs at Batu Hijau, lower
    diesel costs and a lower co-product allocation of costs to
    copper at Batu Hijau.

Costs applicable to sales

per
    consolidated copper pound increased 31% in 2008 compared to 2007
    due to lower copper production.

We expect 2010 consolidated gold production of approximately 6.3
    to 6.8 million ounces, primarily due to higher production
    from Asia Pacific as a result of the

ramp-up

of
    Boddington, partially offset by lower production in North
    America and South America as a result of increased waste
    stripping and lower ore grades.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce for 2010 are expected to be approximately $450 to
    $480 per ounce due to lower expected sales at Nevada and
    Yanacocha, and higher oil prices, partially offset by the

ramp-up

of
    lower cost Boddington production. We expect 2010 consolidated
    copper production of approximately 540 to 600 million
    pounds at

Costs applicable to sales

of approximately
    $0.85 to $0.95 per pound as a result of higher expected oil

Nevada, USA.

Gold ounces sold decreased 10%
    due to lower mill ore grades and lower leach placement. Open pit
    ore mined decreased 21% to 29.6 million tons in 2009 due to
    mine sequencing at Gold Quarry. Underground ore mined increased
    10% to 2.7 million tons in 2009 due to higher tonnage at
    Leeville as well as remnant mining at Carlin East. Mill ore
    grade decreased 9% due to lower grades from Leeville as well as
    ramping down and completion of production at Deep Post. Ore
    placed on leach pads decreased 40% to 11.9 million tons in
    2009, primarily as a result of mine sequencing at Gold Quarry,
    partially offset by the

start-up

of
    North Lantern.

Costs applicable to sales

2008 compared
    to 2007

Nevada, USA.

Gold ounces sold in Nevada
    decreased 5% due to the completion of milling at Lone Tree,
    lower production at Twin Creeks and reduced ore processing by
    third parties experiencing operating and financial difficulties,
    partially offset by higher production from Midas, Leeville and
    leach pads. Open pit ore mined decreased 12% to
    37.4 million tons due to mine sequencing at Twin Creeks and
    Phoenix. Underground ore mined increased to 2.5 million
    tons from 1.9 million tons due to an 80% increase at
    Leeville. Ore milled decreased to 24.8 million tons from
    25.5 million tons, while mill ore grade decreased 5% due to
    processing lower grade Twin Creeks stockpiles. Ore placed on
    leach pads increased to 19.8 million tons, up from
    14.0 million tons, primarily as a result of mine sequencing
    at Gold Quarry and the

start-up

of
    Bobstar.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased 5%
    as lower production, increased diesel and other commodity costs,
    increased underground mining costs, higher royalties and taxes
    were partially offset by the completion of higher cost Carlin
    East mining and Lone Tree processing,

start-up

of
    the power plant and higher by-product credits.

Amortization

Consolidated gold production for North America is expected to
    decline to approximately 1.7 to 1.9 million ounces in 2010
    and 2011 due to lower production from the Carlin operations and
    the closure of Deep Post, partially offset by anticipated
    increases at Leeville. Production from the Carlin operations is
    expected to be impacted by a geotechnical event that occurred at
    Gold Quarry in late December 2009, limiting access to ore that
    was originally scheduled to be mined in 2010 and 2011. Following
    a series of geotechnical, mine planning and ore blending
    analyses conducted by the Company in January and February, up to
    approximately 150,000 ounces of gold production are expected to
    be deferred from Gold Quarry in 2010, with potential additional
    ounces deferred in 2011. The Company continues to study
    opportunities to safely accelerate the production of the ounces
    currently scheduled to be produced in 2012 through 2013. 2010

cost applicable to sales

are expected to increase to
    approximately $575 to $615 per ounce, primarily due to lower
    production and higher expected diesel and input commodity
    prices. Based on current mine plans, consolidated gold
    production in the North America region in 2011 is expected to
    remain at 2010 levels with the potential for slightly higher
    production in 2012 primarily due to higher production from new
    underground mines and open pits from the Nevada growth projects
    as well as higher production from La Herradura and mining
    of the deferred ounces at Gold Quarry in Nevada. Costs
    applicable to sales in 2010 are expected to be approximately
    $575 to $615 per ounce, primarily due to lower production and
    higher expected diesel and input commodity prices.

Costs
    applicable to sales

in 2011 and 2012 are expected to remain
    near 2010 levels with the potential of decreasing with the
    addition of the growth projects in Nevada and La Herradura
    production.

2009 compared
    to 2008

Consolidated gold ounces sold increased 12% due to higher mill
    production, partially offset by lower leach production. Mill
    production increased 326,200 ounces due to a full year of
    operation and 44% higher mill ore grade. Leach production
    decreased by 5% due to the timing of recovery from the leach
    pads. Ore placed on the leach pads increased to
    136.3 million tons from 97.8 million tons at a
    consistent grade of 0.018 ounces per ton.

    Ore placed on the leach pads decreased to 97.8 million tons
    from 98.3 million tons while leach ore grades decreased 5%
    to 0.018 ounces per ton. Gold production increased by 16%
    primarily due to 304,200 ounces from the new mill. Start up of
    the mill occurred in late March and commercial production was
    achieved in the second quarter of 2008.

Costs applicable to
    sales

increased $33 per ounce due to higher diesel and
    commodity costs and higher workers participation and royalty
    costs as a result of higher gold prices, partially offset by
    higher gold production and higher by-product credits.

Amortization

per ounce decreased 11% as a result of
    higher gold production partially offset by amortization of the
    new mill.

Consolidated gold production in South America is expected to
    decrease in 2010 to approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million
    ounces, primarily due to lower tonnage mined and lower grades.

Costs applicable to sales

are expected to increase in
    2010 to approximately $360 to $400 per ounce, primarily due to
    lower gold production and higher contracted services and
    supplies. Based on current mine plans, assumptions and
    conditions, consolidated gold production in the South America
    region for 2011 through 2012 is expected to remain near 2010
    levels. Over the same time period,

Costs applicable to sales

decreased to $0.62 per pound of copper
    and $214 per ounce of gold (55% and 48% lower, respectively), as
    a result of higher production.

Costs applicable to
    sales — gold

also decreased due to a higher
    co-product allocation of costs to copper due to a higher
    realized copper price.

Amortization

per pound of copper
    and ounce of gold decreased 43% and 35%, respectively, due to
    higher production.

At December 31, 2009, Batu Hijau had copper sales of
    158.3 million pounds priced at an average of $3.34 per
    pound subject to final pricing compared to 82.0 million
    pounds priced at an average of $1.39 per pound at
    December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, Boddington
    had copper sales of 1.8 million pounds priced at an average
    of $3.35 per pound subject to final pricing.

On September 18, 2009, Batu Hijau experienced a
    geotechnical failure in a portion of the west wall of the open
    pit. Batu Hijau utilizes a number of preventive measures,
    including radar threshold alarms, to monitor movements in the
    pit walls. As a result, mobile equipment and personnel were
    evacuated from the pit prior to the wall failure. Operations
    were suspended for approximately three weeks in the pit pending
    a geotechnical review and development of a remediation plan to
    recommence mining operations. Batu Hijau continued to process
    lower grade ore from stockpiles during the suspension period.
    Mining operations returned to normal on October 10, 2009.
    The geotechnical failure will require the accelerated removal of
    waste material displaced from the event as well as changes to
    the balance of Phase 5 and the initiation of Phase 6. In
    general, the Company expects delays in access to ore previously
    anticipated in 2010 and 2011 with a marginal decrease in ore
    mined from the ultimate Phase 6 pit.

2008 compared
    to 2007

Jundee, Australia.

Gold ounces sold increased
    27% due to higher grade and a change in the mining sequence
    resulting in additional high grade ore mined from Westside,
    partially offset by lower mill throughput.

Costs applicable
    to sales

per ounce decreased 15%, attributable to higher
    production and lower milling costs, partially offset by higher
    fuel and power costs, and movements in the Australian dollar
    exchange rate, which increased

Costs applicable to sales

by approximately $13 per ounce.

Kalgoorlie, Australia.

Gold ounces sold
    decreased 6% due to a draw-down of gold inventories in 2007, not
    repeated in 2008.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce
    increased 29%, due to lower production, higher fuel costs,
    higher waste tons mined and movements in the Australian dollar



exchange rate, which increased

Costs applicable to sales

by approximately $23 per ounce, partially offset by lower
    milling and administrative costs.

Tanami, Australia.

Gold ounces sold decreased
    17% due to a 15% decrease in mill ore grade.

Costs applicable
    to sales

per ounce increased 46%, due to lower production,
    higher contracted services costs, higher milling costs and
    movements in the Australian dollar exchange rate, which
    increased

Costs applicable to sales

by approximately $20
    per ounce.

Waihi, New Zealand.

Gold ounces sold increased
    52% due to significantly higher mill throughput as mill
    maintenance was completed in the first quarter of 2007, and
    milling more Favona underground ore partially offset by 12%
    lower mill ore grade.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce
    were 14% lower due to higher production and higher by-product
    credits.

Batu Hijau, Indonesia.

Consolidated copper
    pounds and gold ounces sold decreased 32% and 39% respectively,
    due to lower throughput, ore grade and recovery. Batu Hijau
    experienced heavy rainfall during the first quarter of 2008
    causing minor damage to pit infrastructure, as well as adding
    significant amounts of water to the pit, delaying planned access
    to higher grade Phase 4 ore in the bottom of the pit until late
    in the third quarter of 2008. Mill throughput was 19% lower in
    2008 compared to 2007 due to processing harder ores and blending
    limitations as a majority of 2008 ore was sourced from
    stockpiles and Phase 5 ore. Ore processed during 2008 was lower
    in grade and contributed to lower recovery than ores processed
    in 2007.

Costs applicable to sales

per pound of copper
    and per ounce of gold increased 31% and 78%, respectively, as a
    result of higher mining costs due to increased diesel, labor and
    milling costs, partially offset by lower waste tons mined.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce of gold also
    increased as a higher co-product allocation of costs was made to
    gold as a result of higher gold prices and lower copper prices.

Amortization

per pound of copper and ounce of gold
    increased 27% and 70%, respectively, due to lower production.

Consolidated gold production for Asia Pacific is expected to
    increase in 2010 to approximately 2.6 to 2.8 million
    ounces, primarily as a result of the Boddington

ramp-up.

Costs applicable to sales

are expected to decrease to
    approximately $400 to $440 per ounce in 2010, primarily driven
    by the

ramp-up

of
    Boddington production, partially offset by higher diesel price
    and less favorable Australian dollar exchange rate assumptions.
    We expect consolidated copper production for the Asia Pacific
    operations of approximately 540 to 600 million pounds at

Costs applicable to sales

of approximately $0.85 to $0.95
    per pound in 2010. Based on current mine plans, assumptions and
    conditions, consolidated gold production for 2011 through 2012
    is expected to remain at the 2010 levels primarily due to the
    new production at Boddington and extended mine-life at Jundee
    and Waihi offsetting declining production at Tanami and Batu
    Hijau. Over the same time period,

Costs applicable to sales

are anticipated to increase slightly as lower cost
    production from Boddington will be offset by higher operating
    costs at Batu Hijau as the Company begins waste stripping Phase
    6.

    divestiture requirements, see the discussion under Item 2
    Properties, above and Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial

2009 compared
    to 2008

Gold ounces sold increased 5% due to a drawdown of finished
    goods inventory, partially offset by lower mill recovery.

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce increased 9% due to
    higher labor, contracted services, maintenance and power costs,
    partially offset by lower diesel prices.

Amortization

per
    ounce decreased slightly as higher production was mostly offset
    by the use of additional mining equipment.

2008 compared
    to 2007

Gold ounces sold increased 17% due to a 25% increase in mill ore
    grade and higher throughput, partially offset by an increase in
    in-process inventory. Total tons mined increased to
    50.6 million tons from 44.2 million tons due to
    equipment additions, increased mining efficiencies and the
    operation of a third pit.

Costs applicable to sales

per
    ounce increased 9% due to higher diesel, power, royalties,
    maintenance and contract services costs, partially offset by
    higher production.

Amortization

per ounce increased 31%
    due to the use of additional equipment and the operation of a
    third pit.

Gold production for the Africa operations is expected to
    decrease to approximately 460,000 to 500,000 ounces in 2010 due
    to mining additional waste material and lower ore grade.

Costs applicable to sales

of approximately $515 to $555
    per ounce are expected for 2010, primarily as a result of lower
    production, higher diesel prices and higher labor and royalty
    costs. Based on current mine plans, assumptions and conditions,
    consolidated gold production and

Costs applicable to sales

for 2011 through 2012 are expected to remain at the 2010
    levels.

Development of the fourth pit, Amoma, is on schedule and
    production is expected to commence during the fourth quarter of
    2010. With the granting of the required mining license by the
    Ghanaian authorities earlier this year, we are advancing the
    development of our Akyem project, with completion anticipated in
    the 2013 to 2014 timeframe.

Newmont and other gold companies with production in Ghana,
    formed a consortium to import power generation equipment and
    constructed an 80 mega-watt power plant. The plant was
    commissioned in 2008 and transferred to the Volta River
    Authority in 2009. As a result, the Ghanaian government has
    agreed to distribute power proportionately between participating
    mines and other industrial and commercial customers, if
    required, to curtail power consumption as a result of power
    shortages.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rates

In addition to our domestic operations in the United States, we
    have operations in Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Indonesia,
    Ghana and other foreign locations. Our operations sell their
    production based on U.S. dollar metal prices.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to
    the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and

Costs applicable to sales

to the extent costs are paid in
    foreign currencies. Such fluctuations have not had a material
    impact on our revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout
    the world principally in U.S. dollars. Approximately 24%,
    27% and 28% of our

Costs applicable to sales

were paid in
    local currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2009, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Our

Costs applicable to sales

are
    most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian
    dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. However, variations in
    the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate
    historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the
    U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or
    decreases in costs at Australian locations due to exchange rate
    changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in
    sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations. No
    assurance, however, can be given that the Australian
    dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be
    strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the
    future.

Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to
    the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations decreased

Costs applicable to sales

$41 in 2009 from 2008, and
    increased

Costs applicable to sales

$11 in 2008 from
    2007, primarily by movements in the Australian dollar.



We have a program to hedge up to 85% of our forecasted
    Australian dollar denominated operating expenditures. At
    December 31, 2009, we have hedged 60%, 37% and 13% of our
    forecasted Australian denominated operating costs in 2010, 2011
    and 2012, respectively, at an average rate of 0.77, 0.75 and
    0.78, respectively.

Foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the
    U.S. dollar have not had a material impact on our
    determination of proven and probable reserves in the past.
    However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in
    relation to the Australian dollar,

and/or

to
    other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were
    not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar
    gold price or by other factors, the amount of proven and
    probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be
    reduced as certain proven and probable reserves may no longer be
    economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on
    a variety of factors including the length of time of any such
    weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management’s
    long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. Future
    reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily
    result in reduced gold or copper sales and increased
    amortization and, depending on the level of reduction, could
    also result in impairments of property, plant and mine
    development, mineral interests

and/or

goodwill.

Consolidated Financial Results

, a $177 increase
    in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities ($78 for
    accrued tax liabilities, primarily in Asia Pacific, $74 for
    employee-related liabilities, $58 for other short and long term

    partially offset by a $378 increase in inventories, stockpiles
    (primarily in Asia Pacific and North America) and ore on leach
    pads. Cash flow provided from operations during 2008 was
    impacted by significantly higher realized gold prices and
    increased gold sales volume, partially offset by lower realized
    copper prices and lower copper sales volume and a $343 increase
    in inventories, stockpiles (primarily at Batu Hijau) and ore on
    leach pads, a $198 increase in prepaid taxes and a $103 decrease
    to fund reclamation activities. The 2007 results were negatively
    impacted by the $578



settlement of the price-capped forward sales contracts, $276
    payment of pre-acquisition Australia income taxes of Normandy
    and $174 from the final settlement of copper collar contracts.

We are currently planning to contribute at least $60 to our
    retirement benefit programs in 2010 to bolster plan assets. For

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, $29, $18 and $19, respectively, of
    drilling and related costs were capitalized and included in mine
    development costs. These capitalized costs included $24 at North
    America and $5 at Asia Pacific in 2009; $10 at Asia Pacific and
    $8 at North America in 2008; and $11 at Asia Pacific, $6 at
    North America and $1 at Africa and South America in 2007.

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, $26, $27 and $16, respectively, of
    pre-stripping costs were capitalized and included in mine
    development costs. Pre-stripping costs included the North
    Lantern pit in Nevada in 2009, the Bobstar pit and North Lantern
    pit in Nevada and the Awonsu and Amoma pits at Ahafo in 2008 and
    the Bobstar pit in Nevada in 2007.

We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1,400 to
    $1,600 in 2010, with approximately 30% invested in each of the
    North America and Asia Pacific regions and the remaining 40% at
    other locations. Approximately 60% of the 2010 capital budget is
    allocated to sustaining investments, with the remaining 40%
    allocated to project development, including the development of
    the Akyem project in Ghana and the Conga project in Peru.

Acquisitions, net.

In 2009, we paid $981 (net
    of $1 cash acquired) and paid $15 in acquisition costs to
    acquire the remaining 33.33% interest in Boddington.
    Consideration for the acquisition also includes contingent
    payments capped at $100, equal to 50% of the average realized
    operating margin (Revenue less

Costs applicable to sales

on a by-product basis), if any, exceeding $600 per ounce,
    payable on one-third of gold sales from Boddington beginning in
    the second quarter of 2010. Additionally, we paid $11 for a
    mining property near the La Herradura, Mexico operation in
    2009. During the last quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of
    2008, we paid $953 and $318, respectively, to acquire the
    remaining outstanding common shares of Miramar, resulting in
    Miramar becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary. As a result of the
    completed acquisition of Miramar, we control the Hope Bay
    project, a large undeveloped gold property in Nunavut, Canada.
    In April 2008, we purchased additional shares of EGR for $7, net
    of cash acquired, bringing our ownership interest to 56.67% from
    46.72%. In November 2008, EGR repurchased 6.55% of its own
    shares from a noncontrolling shareholder bringing our ownership
    to 60.64%.



Sales and purchases of marketable
    securities.

We had net proceeds of $nil, $nil and
    $2 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, from auction rate
    marketable debt securities. The auction rate marketable debt
    securities in which we have invested have not traded in an
    active market since August 2007 and there are currently no
    market quotations available.

During 2009, we purchased marketable equity securities of Regis
    Resources for $5 and we received cash of $17 for the sale of
    Regis Resources and other marketable equity securities and the
    redemption of asset backed commercial paper. During 2008, we
    purchased marketable equity securities of Gabriel for $11 and
    other marketable equity securities for $6 and we received cash
    of $50 for the sale of marketable equity securities. During
    2007, we purchased marketable equity securities of Gabriel for
    $27 and other marketable equity securities for $9.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash provided from financing activities of continuing
    operations

was $2,572 in 2009, compared to $127 and $458 in
    2008 and 2007, respectively, for the reasons explained below.

Proceeds from debt, net.

During 2009 we
    received aggregate proceeds from debt of $4,299 comprised of:
    $1,080 net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes due
    in 2039, $895 net proceeds from the issuance of senior
    notes due in 2019, $504 net proceeds from the issuance of
    convertible senior notes due in 2012, $54 from short-term
    borrowings at Batu Hijau, $10 under the Ahafo project facility
    and $1,756 under our $2,000 revolving credit facility. At
    December 31, 2009 we had no borrowings under our revolving
    credit facility. The revolving credit facility is also used to
    secure the issuance of letters of credit totaling $452,
    primarily supporting reclamation obligations.

Repayment of debt.

During 2009 we repaid
    $2,731 of debt: $86 for Batu Hijau project financing scheduled
    debt repayments, $72 for short-term borrowings at Batu Hijau,
    $24 related to the sale-leaseback of the refractory ore
    treatment plant (classified as a capital lease), $2,513 under
    our $2,000 revolving credit facility and $36 on other credit
    facilities and other capital leases. Scheduled minimum debt
    repayments are $157 in 2010, $334 in 2011, $608 in 2012, $116 in
    2013, $535 in 2014 and $3,059 thereafter. We expect to be able
    to fund maturities of debt from

Net cash provided from
    operations

, cash balances, existing credit facilities,
    proceeds of asset sales and financing alternatives available in
    the public capital markets.

At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all
    required debt covenants and other restrictions related to our
    debt agreements.

Proceeds from stock issuance, net.

We received
    proceeds of $1,278, $29 and $51 during 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, from the February 2009 public offering and the
    issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock
    options. In February 2009 we completed a public offering of
    34,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $37 per
    share for net proceeds of $1,234.

Sale of subsidiary shares to noncontrolling
    interests.

In November and December 2009, Nusa
    Tenggara Partnership (“NTP”) completed the sale of 10%
    and 7% of shares in PTNNT to a third party buyer, respectively.
    These transactions reduced our ownership interest in PTNNT to
    35.44%. Cash proceeds from the sale were $638, with our 56.25%
    share being $359 and the balance of $279 was paid to our NTP
    partner.

Acquisition of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling
    interests.

In December 2009, we entered into a
    transaction with P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an
    unrelated noncontrolling partner of PTNNT whereby we agreed to
    advance certain funds to PTPI in exchange for a pledge of the
    noncontrolling partner’s 20% share of PTNNT dividends, net
    of withholding tax, and the assignment of its voting rights to
    us. As a result, our effective economic interest in PTNNT
    increased by 17% to 52.44% at December 31, 2009.



Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests.

We
    paid dividends of $394, $389 and $270 to noncontrolling
    interests during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2009
    dividends included $279 for our NTP partner’s share of the
    sale of the 17% interest in Batu Hijau.

Dividends paid to common stockholders.

We paid
    annual dividends of $0.40 per common share during 2009, 2008 and

    C$0.46, C$0.43, and C$0.43 during 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. On February 24, 2010, we declared a regular
    quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, payable March 30,
    2010 to holders of record at the close of business on
    March 12, 2010. The total paid to common stockholders was
    $196, $182 and $181 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

    Kollo and $7 in 2007 for debt proceeds at Kori Kollo.

Corporate
    Revolving Credit Facility

The Company has an uncollateralized $2,000 revolving credit
    facility with a syndicate of commercial banks, which matures in
    April 2012. The facility contains a letter of credit

sub-facility.

Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the credit
    ratings of the Company’s senior, uncollateralized,
    long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest at
    an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.28% or the
    lead bank’s prime interest rate. Facility fees accrue at an
    annual rate of 0.07% of the aggregate commitments. The Company
    also pays a utilization fee of 0.05% on the amount of revolving
    credit loans and letters of credit outstanding under the
    facility for each day on which the sum of such loans and letters
    of credit exceed 50% of the commitments under the facility. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the facility fees were 0.07% of
    the commitment. There was $452 and $519 outstanding under the
    letter of credit

sub-facility

at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At
    December 31, 2009, $nil was borrowed under the facility.



Debt
    Covenants

The


/


%
    and

    notes, and sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant
    debt facilities contain various covenants and default provisions
    including payment defaults, limitation on liens, limitation on
    sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions.

The Ahafo project facility contains a financial ratio covenant
    requiring us to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and
    cash equivalents) to EBITDA (earnings before interest expense,
    income taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of less than
    or equal to 4.0 and a net debt to total capitalization ratio of
    less than or equal to 62.5%.

In addition to the covenants noted above, the corporate
    revolving credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant
    requiring us to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and
    cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less than or
    equal to 62.5%. Furthermore, the corporate revolving credit
    facility contains covenants limiting the sale of all or
    substantially all of our assets, certain change of control
    provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets.

Certain of our project debt facilities contain debt covenants
    and default provisions including limitations on dividends
    subject to certain debt service cover ratios, limitations on
    sales of assets, negative pledges on certain assets, restricted
    payments to partners, change of control provisions and
    limitations of additional permitted debt.

At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all debt
    covenants and provisions related to potential defaults.

Shelf
    Registration Statement

In October 2007, we filed with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (the “SEC”) a shelf registration statement
    on

Form S-3

which enables the Company to issue an indeterminate number or
    amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities,
    guarantees of debt securities and warrants from time to time at
    indeterminate prices. It also included the resale of an
    indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock and debt
    securities from time to time upon exercise of warrants or
    conversion of convertible securities. In accordance with SEC
    rules and in advance of the expiration of the October 2007 shelf
    registration statement, we filed a replacement registration
    statement with the SEC in September 2009, which became
    automatically effective upon filing.

Future Cash
    Flows

We anticipate that significant capital expenditures in future
    years (see Investing Activities, above), funding of exploration
    and advanced projects, debt repayments and dividends to both
    common shareholders and noncontrolling interests is expected to
    impact

Net cash used in investing activities

and

Net
    cash used in financing activities

exceeding

Net cash
    provided by operations

. Our ability to raise and service
    significant new sources of capital will be a function of
    macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices as well
    as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt
    position, among other factors. Although we currently carry a
    large cash balance, we may determine that it may be necessary or
    appropriate to issue additional equity or other securities,
    defer projects or



sell assets. Additional financing may not be available when
    needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be
    favorable to us and, if raised by offering equity securities,
    may involve substantial dilution to existing stockholders. In
    the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated
    operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations,
    our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in
    existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities,
    retire or service all outstanding debt and pay dividends could
    be significantly constrained. For information on our long-term
    debt, capital lease obligations and operating leases, see
    Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the
    realized spot price of gold and copper. For information on the
    sensitivity of our

Net cash provided by operations

to
    metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures about Market Risk.

Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in
    foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the
    U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Australian
    and New Zealand dollars. Accordingly, we have entered into
    derivative instruments to reduce the volatility of

Costs
    applicable to sales

in Asia Pacific. For information
    concerning the sensitivity of our

Costs applicable to sales

to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see Results
    of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates,
    above. For information on the sensitivity of our

Net cash
    provided from operations

to foreign currency exchange rates,
    see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
    Market Risk.

Net cash provided from operations

will also
    be impacted in 2010 as a result of planned contributions of at
    least $60 for our post-retirement benefit programs.

Based on expected production of between 6.3 and 6.8 million
    ounces of gold and between 540 and 600 million pounds of
    copper in 2010, we do not anticipate reasonably expected
    variations in our production profile alone to influence our
    ability to pay our debt and other obligations in 2010.

Environmental

Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various
    federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection
    of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually
    changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. We conduct
    our operations so as to protect the public health and
    environment and believe our operations are in compliance with
    applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. We
    have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to
    comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the
    full amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future
    reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory
    requirements. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, $698 and $594,
    respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to
    currently or recently producing mineral properties, of which $36
    is classified as current liabilities expected to be spent in
    2010.

In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning
    environmental obligations associated with former mining
    activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and
    implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. We
    believe that the related environmental obligations associated
    with these sites are similar in nature with respect to the
    development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the
    compliance required to meet general environmental standards.
    Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters,
    $161 and $163 were accrued for such obligations at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Depending upon
    the ultimate resolution of these matters, we believe that it is
    reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could
    be as much as 148% greater or 3% lower than the amount accrued
    at December 31, 2009. The amounts accrued for these matters
    are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances
    available at the time. Changes in estimates are charged to

Other expense, net

in the period estimates are revised.

We spent $20, $39 and $13 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively,
    for environmental obligations related to former, primarily
    historic, mining activities, and have classified $18 as a
    current liability expected to be spent in 2010. Expenditures for
    2009 related primarily to Grass Valley in California, the Mt.
    Leyshon property in Australia, which is a legacy Normandy site,
    the Dawn mill site and the Con



mine from the Miramar acquisition. Expenditures for 2008 related
    primarily to Resurrection, a mine site in Leadville, Colorado as
    well as the Mt. Leyshon property. Expenditures for 2007 related
    primarily to legacy Normandy properties in Australia, the
    McCoy/Cove property in Nevada and the Dawn mill site.

Included in capital expenditures were $131, $231 and $91 in
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, to comply with environmental
    regulations. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental
    regulations have not been a significant component of

Costs
    applicable to sales

.

Included in

Other long-term assets

is $11 of restricted
    cash that is legally restricted for purposes of settling asset
    retirement obligations related to the Con mine from the Miramar
    acquisition. Included in

Investments

are $10 and $5 of
    long-term marketable debt securities and long-term marketable
    equity securities, respectively, that are legally pledged for
    purposes of settling asset retirement obligations related to the
    San Jose Reservoir in Yanacocha.

    remediation liabilities, see Note 25 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Forward-Looking
    Statements

The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain
    information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor
    created thereby. See the discussion in Forward-Looking
    Statements in Item 1, Business.

Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures

Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional
    information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed
    by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
    These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a
    substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance
    with GAAP.

Adjusted net
    income

Management of the Company uses the non-GAAP financial measure
    Adjusted net income to evaluate the Company’s operating
    performance, and for planning and forecasting future business
    operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income
    allows investors and analysts to compare results of the
    continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect
    subsidiaries relating to the production and sale of minerals to
    similar operating results of other mining companies, by
    excluding exceptional or unusual items, income or loss from
    discontinued operations and the permanent impairment of assets,
    including marketable securities and goodwill. Management’s
    determination of the components of Adjusted net income are
    evaluated periodically and based, in part, on



a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry
    analysts. Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders
    is reconciled to adjusted net income as follows:

    Management also assesses the performance of the Boddington mine
    on a by-product basis due to the majority of revenues being

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (dollars in
    millions except per share, per ounce and per pound
    amounts)

Metal
    Price

Changes in the market price of gold and copper significantly
    affect our profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can
    fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand;
    forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and
    lending; investor sentiment; the relative strength of the
    U.S. dollar and global mine production levels. Copper is
    traded on established international exchanges and copper prices
    generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be
    influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by
    currency exchange rates.

Foreign
    Currency

Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to
    the U.S. dollar may affect our profitability and cash flow.
    Foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to
    numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and
    U.S. currencies and U.S. and foreign country economic
    conditions. In addition to our operations in the United States,
    we have assets or operations in Australia, Peru, Indonesia,
    Canada, New Zealand, Ghana and Mexico. Our

non-U.S. operations

sell their metal production based on a U.S. dollar gold
    price. Fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in
    relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit
    margins and

Costs applicable to sales

per ounce to the
    extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations.
    The Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate has had the
    greatest impact on our

Costs applicable to sales

, as
    measured in U.S. dollars. However, variations in the
    Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate have
    historically been strongly correlated to variations in the
    U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or
    decreases in costs at Australian gold operations due to exchange
    rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in
    sales reported in U.S. dollars for such locations. No
    assurance can be given that the Australian
    dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be
    strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the
    future, or that short-term changes in the Australian
    dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will not have an impact on
    our profitability and cash flow. Foreign currency exchange rates
    in relation to the U.S. dollar have not had a material
    impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves in
    the past. However, if a sustained weakening of the
    U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar,

and/or

to
    other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were
    not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar
    gold price or by other factors, profitability, cash flows and
    the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable
    foreign country could be reduced. The extent of any such
    reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including
    the length of time of any such weakening of the
    U.S. dollar, and management’s long-term view of the
    applicable exchange rate. For information concerning the
    sensitivity of our

Costs applicable to sales

to changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7,
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated
    Results of Operations and Financial Condition-Results of
    Consolidated Operations-Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above.

Hedging

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes
    in the gold and copper prices by selling our gold and copper
    production at current market prices. Consequently, we do not
    hedge our gold and copper sales. We continue to manage risks
    associated with commodity input costs, interest rates and
    foreign currencies using the derivative market.

By using derivatives, we are affected by credit risk, market
    risk and market liquidity risk. Credit risk is the risk that a
    third party might fail to fulfill its performance obligations
    under the terms of a financial instrument. We mitigate credit
    risk by entering into derivatives with high credit quality
    counterparties, limiting the amount of exposure to each
    counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of the
    counterparties. Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a
    derivative might be adversely affected by a change in underlying
    commodity prices, interest rates, or currency exchange



rates, and that this in turn affects our financial condition. We
    manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters
    that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be
    undertaken. We mitigate this risk by establishing trading
    agreements with counterparties under which we are not required
    to post any collateral or make any margin calls on our
    derivatives. Our counterparties cannot require settlement solely
    because of an adverse change in the fair value of a derivative.
    Market liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative cannot be
    eliminated quickly, by either liquidating it or by establishing
    an offsetting position. Under the terms of our trading
    agreements, counterparties cannot require us to immediately
    settle outstanding derivatives, except upon the occurrence of
    customary events of default such as covenant breeches, including
    financial covenants, insolvency or bankruptcy. We generally
    mitigate market liquidity risk by spreading out the maturity of
    our derivatives over time.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

During the three years ended 2009, we entered into IDR/$ fixed
    forward contracts to hedge a portion of our IDR/$ operating
    expenditure exposure and $/A$ fixed forward contracts in Other
    Australia/New Zealand and Boddington to hedge a portion of our
    A$ operating expenditure exposure and our A$ capital expenditure
    exposure related to the construction of Boddington. In 2008, we
    began a similar $/NZ$ layered fixed forward contract program to
    hedge a portion of our NZ$ denominated operating expenditures in
    Other Australia/New Zealand. Also in 2008, we implemented a
    program to hedge a portion of our operating cost exposure
    related to diesel prices of fuel consumed at our Nevada
    operations. All of the currency and diesel contracts have been
    designated as cash flow hedges of future expenditures, and as
    such, changes in the market value have been recorded in

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

.

Given that the fair value of our derivative instruments are
    based upon market rates and prices and that the volatility of
    these rates and prices are dependent on many factors subject to
    fluctuation, we are exposed to liquidity risks related to these
    contracts. We cash settle the fair value of each contract upon
    settlement with our counterparties. The settlement values of our
    contracts could differ significantly from the current fair
    values. As such, we are exposed to liquidity risk related to
    unfavorable changes in the fair value of our derivative
    contracts.

We had the following derivative instruments designated as hedges
    with fair values at December 31, 2009 and December 31,
    2008:

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Risk

We utilize foreign currency contracts to reduce the variability
    of the US dollar amount of forecasted foreign currency
    expenditures caused by changes in currency exchange rates.

We hedge a portion of our IDR, A$, and NZ$ denominated operating
    expenditures each period. The hedging instruments are fixed
    forward contracts with expiration dates ranging up to three
    years from the date of issue. The principal hedging objective is
    reduction in the volatility of realized

period-on-period

foreign exchange rates. Beginning in 2010, we will not enter
    into any additional IDR fixed forward contracts.

We hedged our A$ denominated capital expenditures related to the
    construction of Boddington. The hedging instruments consisted of
    a series of fixed forward contracts and bought call option
    contracts with expiration dates ranging up to one year from the
    date of issue. The $30 net realized loss associated with
    the capital expenditure hedge program was recorded in

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

net of tax
    and will be recognized in

Amortization

over the life of
    the related Boddington assets. At December 31, 2009, the
    Company had no outstanding hedges for the Boddington capital
    program.

All of the foreign currency contracts were designated as cash
    flow hedges, and as such, the effective portion of unrealized
    changes in market value have been recorded in

Accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss)

and are recorded in
    earnings during the period in which the hedged transaction
    affects earnings. Gains and losses from hedge ineffectiveness
    are recognized in current earnings.



We had the following foreign currency derivative contracts
    outstanding at December 31, 2009:

Diesel Price
    Risk

We hedge up to 66% of our operating cost exposure related to
    diesel consumed at our Nevada operations to reduce the
    variability in realized diesel prices. The hedging instruments
    consist of a series of financially settled fixed forward
    contracts with expiration dates of up to two years from the date
    of issue. The contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges
    of future diesel purchases, and as such, the effective portion
    of unrealized changes in the market value have been recorded in

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

and are
    recorded in earnings during the period in which the hedged
    transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses from hedge
    ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings.

We had the following diesel derivative contracts outstanding at
    December 31, 2009:

Treasury Rate
    Lock Contracts

In connection with the 2019 and 2039 notes issued in September
    2009, we acquired treasury rate lock contracts to reduce the
    variability of the proceeds realized from the bond issuances.
    The treasury rate locks resulted in $6 and $5 unrealized gains
    for the 2019 and 2039 notes, respectively. We previously
    acquired treasury rate locks in connection with the issuance of
    the 2035 notes that resulted in a $10 unrealized loss. The
    gains/losses from these contracts are recognized in

Interest
    expense, net

over the terms of the respective notes.

Fair Value
    Hedges

Interest Rate
    Risk

At December 31, 2009, we had $222 fixed to floating swap
    contracts designated as a hedge against our


/


% senior
    notes. The interest rate swap contracts assist in management of
    our targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Under the
    hedge contract terms, we receive fixed-rate interest



payments at 8.63% and pay floating-rate interest amounts based
    on periodic London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
    settings plus a spread, ranging from 2.60% to 7.63%. The
    interest rate swap contracts were designated as fair value
    hedges and, as such, changes in fair value have been recorded in
    income in each period, consistent with recording changes to the

mark-to-market

value of the underlying hedged liability in income. Changes in
    the

mark-to-market

value of the effective portion of the interest rate swap
    contracts are recognized as a component of

Interest expense,
    net.

The hedge contracts decreased

Interest expense, net

by $4, $2 and $nil during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    During 2009, 2008 and 2007, losses of $3 and gains of $4 and $3
    were included in

Other income, net

for the ineffective
    portion of these swap contracts designated as fair value hedges,
    respectively.

Commodity Price
    Risk

LME copper prices averaged $2.34 per pound during 2009, compared
    with our recorded average provisional price of $2.53 per pound
    before

mark-to-market

gains and treatment and refining charges. The applicable forward
    copper price at the end of the year was $3.34 per pound. During
    2009, increasing copper prices resulted in a provisional pricing

mark-to-market

gain of $173 ($0.33 per pound). At December 31, 2009, we
    had copper sales of 160 million pounds priced at an average
    of $3.34 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next
    several months.

The average London P.M. gold fix was $973 per ounce during 2009,
    compared with our recorded average provisional gold price of
    $977 per ounce before

mark-to-market

gains and treatment and refining charges. The applicable forward
    gold price at the end of the year was $1,094 per ounce. During
    2009, changes in gold prices resulted in a provisional pricing

mark-to-market

gain of $15 ($2 per ounce). At December 31, 2009, we had
    gold sales of 85,000 ounces priced at an average of $1,094 per
    ounce, subject to final pricing over the next several months.

Fixed and
    Variable Rate Debt

We have both fixed and variable rate debt. 93% and 66% of debt
    was fixed and 7% and 34% was variable at December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. Fixed debt increased primarily due to
    the issuance of the 2012, 2019 and 2039 notes, which had a
    combined carrying value of $2,446 at December 31, 2009.
    Variable rate debt decreased primarily due to the decreased
    borrowings on the Corporate Revolving Credit facility, which was
    $nil and $757 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    We have managed some of our fixed rate debt exposure by entering
    into interest rate swaps (see Interest Rate Swap Contracts
    above). Our fixed rate debt exposure at December 31, 2009
    and 2008 is summarized as follows:

    interest rate variations may differ from the above assumptions.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    Company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors,
    management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting at
    December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, the
    Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

. Based
    upon its assessment, management concluded that, at
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company’s assessment of internal
    control over financial reporting at December 31, 2009 has
    been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
    which appears herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Newmont Mining
    Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of income (loss),
    comprehensive income (loss), change in equity and cash flows
    present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
    of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting at December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to
    express opinions on these financial statements and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    uncertain tax positions effective January 1, 2007, which
    did not require retrospective application, and changed its
    methods of accounting for convertible debt and noncontrolling
    interests all effective January 1, 2009, which required
    retrospective application for all periods presented.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 1

THE
    COMPANY

Newmont Mining Corporation and its affiliates and subsidiaries
    (collectively, “Newmont” or the “Company”)
    predominantly operates in the mining industry, focused on the
    exploration for and production of gold and copper.

The Company has significant assets or operations in the United
    States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, New Zealand
    and Mexico. The cash flow and profitability of the
    Company’s operations are significantly affected by the
    market price of gold, and to a lesser extent, copper. The prices
    of gold and copper are affected by numerous factors beyond the
    Company’s control.

The Company has evaluated all subsequent events through
    February 24, 2010.

References to “A$” refers to Australian currency,
    “C$” to Canadian currency, “NZ$” to
    New Zealand currency, “IDR” to Indonesian
    currency and “$” to United States currency.

SUMMARY OF
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Accounting
    Standards Codification

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) established the

FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification

(“ASC”) as the single source of
    authoritative generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) to be applied by nongovernmental entities.
    The ASC is a new structure which took existing accounting
    pronouncements and organized them by accounting topic. Relevant
    authoritative literature issued by the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (“SEC”) and select SEC staff
    interpretations and administrative literature was also included
    in the ASC. All other accounting guidance not included in the
    ASC is non-authoritative. The ASC was effective for the
    Company’s interim quarterly period beginning July 1,
    2009. The adoption of the ASC did not have an impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Use of
    Estimates

The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been
    prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the
    Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires the
    Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The more
    significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and
    assumptions relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for
    future cash flow estimates utilized in impairment calculations
    and

units-of-production

amortization calculations; environmental, reclamation and
    closure obligations; estimates of recoverable gold and other
    minerals in stockpile and leach pad inventories; estimates of
    fair value for certain reporting units and asset impairments
    (including impairments of goodwill, long-lived assets and
    investments); write-downs of inventory, stockpiles and ore on
    leach pads to net realizable value; post-employment,
    post-retirement and other employee benefit liabilities;
    valuation allowances for deferred tax assets; reserves for
    contingencies and litigation; and the fair value and accounting
    treatment of financial instruments including marketable
    securities and derivative instruments. The Company bases its
    estimates on historical experience and on various other
    assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
    circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may differ
    significantly from these estimates under different assumptions
    or conditions.



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Principles of
    Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
    Newmont Mining Corporation and more-than-50%-owned subsidiaries
    that it controls and entities over which control is achieved
    through means other than voting rights. The Company also
    includes its pro-rata share of assets, liabilities and
    operations for unincorporated joint ventures in which it has an
    interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
    have been eliminated. The functional currency for the majority
    of the Company’s operations, including the Australian
    operations, is the U.S. dollar.

The Company follows the ASC guidance for identification and
    reporting for entities over which control is achieved through
    means other than voting rights. The guidance defines such
    entities as Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”).
    Newmont identified the Nusa Tenggara Partnership
    (“NTP”), a partnership between Newmont and an
    affiliate of Sumitomo, that owns a 63% interest in PT Newmont
    Nusa Tenggara (“PTNNT” or “Batu Hijau”), as
    a VIE due to certain capital structures and contractual
    relationships.

In December 2009, the Company entered into a transaction with
    P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an unrelated
    noncontrolling partner of PTNNT whereby the Company agreed to
    advance certain funds to PTPI in exchange for a pledge of the
    noncontrolling partner’s 20% share of PTNNT dividends, net
    of withholding tax, and the assignment of its voting rights to
    the Company. As a result, PTPI was determined to be a VIE as it
    has minimal equity capital and the voting rights to its 20%
    interest in PTNNT reside with Newmont.

Based on the above transaction, the Company recognized an
    additional 17% effective economic interest in PTNNT. Combined
    with the Company’s 56.25% ownership in NTP, Newmont has a
    52.44% effective economic interest in PTNNT and continues to
    consolidate Batu Hijau in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and
    highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
    months or less. Because of the short maturity of these
    investments, the carrying amounts approximate their fair value.
    Cash and cash equivalents are invested in United States Treasury
    securities and money market securities. Restricted cash is
    excluded from cash and cash equivalents and is included in other
    current and long-term assets.

Investments

Management determines the appropriate classification of its
    investments in equity securities at the time of purchase and
    reevaluates such determinations at each reporting date.
    Investments in incorporated entities in which the Company’s
    ownership is greater than 20% and less than 50%, or which the
    Company does not control through majority ownership or means
    other than voting rights, are accounted for by the equity method
    and are included in long-term assets. The Company accounts for
    its equity security investments as available for sale securities
    in accordance with ASC guidance on accounting for certain
    investments in debt and equity securities. The Company
    periodically evaluates whether declines in fair values of its
    investments below the Company’s carrying value are

other-than-temporary

in accordance with guidance for the meaning of

other-than-temporary

impairment and its application to certain investments. The
    Company’s policy is to generally treat a decline in the
    investment’s quoted market value that has lasted
    continuously for more than six months as an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. The Company also monitors its investments for
    events or changes in circumstances that have occurred that may
    have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the
    investment and evaluates qualitative and quantitative factors
    regarding the severity and

duration of the unrealized loss and the Company’s ability
    to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs to
    determine if the decline in value of an investment is

other-than-temporary.

Declines in fair value below the Company’s carrying value
    deemed to be

other-than-temporary

are charged to earnings. Additional information concerning the
    Company’s equity method and security investments is
    included in Note 16.

Stockpiles,
    Ore on Leach Pads and Inventories

As described below, costs that are incurred in or benefit the
    productive process are accumulated as stockpiles, ore on leach
    pads and inventories. Stockpiles, ore on leach pads and
    inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or net
    realizable value. Net realizable value represents the estimated
    future sales price of the product based on current and long-term
    metals prices, less the estimated costs to complete production
    and bring the product to sale. Write-downs of stockpiles, ore on
    leach pads and inventories, resulting from net realizable value
    impairments, are reported as a component of

Costs applicable
    to sales

. The current portion of stockpiles, ore on leach
    pads and inventories is determined based on the expected amounts
    to be processed within the next 12 months. Stockpiles, ore
    on leach pads and inventories not expected to be processed
    within the next 12 months are classified as long-term. The
    major classifications are as follows:

Stockpiles

Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine
    and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured
    by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the
    stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on
    assay data) and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates
    (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore
    tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated
    to stockpiles based on relative values of material stockpiled
    and processed using current mining costs incurred up to the
    point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable overhead and
    amortization relating to mining operations, and removed at each
    stockpile’s average cost per recoverable unit.

Ore on Leach
    Pads

The recovery of gold from certain gold oxide ores is achieved
    through the heap leaching process. Under this method, oxide ore
    is placed on leach pads where it is treated with a chemical
    solution, which dissolves the gold contained in the ore. The
    resulting gold-bearing solution is further processed in a plant
    where the gold is recovered. Costs are added to ore on leach
    pads based on current mining costs, including applicable
    amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed
    from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the
    average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the
    leach pad.

The estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are
    calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads
    (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed
    on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery
    percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover
    between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year
    of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching
    process is complete.

Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach
    pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on
    pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical
    balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits
    the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result,
    the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and
    estimates are refined based on actual results over time.
    Historically, the Company’s operating results have not been
    materially impacted by variations between the estimated and
    actual recoverable quantities of gold on its leach



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities
    resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not
    result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for
    on a prospective basis.

In-process
    Inventory

In-process inventories represent materials that are currently in
    the process of being converted to a saleable product. Conversion
    processes vary depending on the nature of the ore and the
    specific processing facility, but include mill in-circuit, leach
    in-circuit, flotation and column cells, and carbon in-pulp
    inventories. In-process material is measured based on assays of
    the material fed into the process and the projected recoveries
    of the respective plants. In-process inventories are valued at
    the average cost of the material fed into the process
    attributable to the source material coming from the mines,
    stockpiles

and/or

leach
    pads plus the in-process conversion costs, including applicable
    amortization relating to the process facilities incurred to that
    point in the process.

Precious Metals
    Inventory

Precious metals inventories include gold doré

and/or

gold
    bullion. Precious metals that result from the Company’s
    mining and processing activities are valued at the average cost
    of the respective in-process inventories incurred prior to the
    refining process, plus applicable refining costs.

Concentrate
    Inventory

Concentrate inventories represent copper and gold concentrate
    available for shipment. The Company values concentrate inventory
    at the average cost, including an allocable portion of support
    costs and amortization. Costs are added and removed to the
    concentrate inventory based on tons of concentrate and are
    valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.

Materials and
    Supplies

Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost
    or net realizable value. Cost includes applicable taxes and
    freight.

Property,
    Plant and Mine Development

Facilities and
    equipment

Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures
    that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment
    are capitalized and recorded at cost. The facilities and
    equipment are amortized using the straight-line method at rates
    sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated productive
    lives, which do not exceed the related estimated mine lives, of
    such facilities based on proven and probable reserves.

Mine
    Development

Mine development costs include engineering and metallurgical
    studies, drilling and other related costs to delineate an ore
    body, the removal of overburden to initially expose an ore body
    at open pit surface mines and the building of access ways,
    shafts, lateral access, drifts, ramps and other infrastructure
    at underground mines. Costs incurred before mineralization is
    classified as proven and probable reserves are expensed and
    classified as

Exploration

or

Advanced projects,
    research and development

expense. Capitalization of mine
    development project costs, that meet the definition of an asset,
    begins once mineralization is classified as proven and probable
    reserves.



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Drilling and related costs are capitalized for an ore body where
    proven and probable reserves exist and the activities are
    directed at obtaining additional information on the ore body or
    converting non-reserve mineralization to proven and probable
    reserves and the benefit is expected to be realized over a
    period beyond one year. All other drilling and related costs are
    expensed as incurred. Drilling costs incurred during the
    production phase for operational ore control are allocated to
    inventory costs and then included as a component of

Costs
    applicable to sales

.

The cost of removing overburden and waste materials to access
    the ore body at an open pit mine prior to the production phase
    are referred to as “pre-stripping costs.”
    Pre-stripping costs are capitalized during the development of an
    open pit mine. Where multiple open pits exist at a mining
    complex utilizing common processing facilities, pre-stripping
    costs are capitalized at each pit. The removal and production of
    de minimis saleable materials may occur during development and
    are recorded as

Other income

, net of incremental mining
    and processing costs.

The production phase of an open pit mine commences when saleable
    minerals, beyond a de minimis amount, are produced. Stripping
    costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are
    variable production costs that are included as a component of
    inventory to be recognized in

Costs applicable to sales

in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory.

The Company’s definition of a mine and the mine’s
    production phase may differ from that of other companies in the
    mining industry resulting in incomparable allocations of
    stripping costs to deferred mine development and production
    costs. Other mining companies may expense pre-stripping costs
    associated with subsequent pits within a mining complex.

Mine development costs are amortized using the

units-of-production

(“UOP”) method based on estimated recoverable ounces
    or pounds in proven and probable reserves. To the extent that
    these costs benefit an entire ore body, they are amortized over
    the estimated life of the ore body. Costs incurred to access
    specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the
    life of that area are amortized over the estimated life of that
    specific ore block or area.

Mineral
    Interests

Mineral interests include acquired interests in production,
    development and exploration stage properties. The mineral
    interests are capitalized at their fair value at the acquisition
    date, either as an individual asset purchase or as part of a
    business combination.

The value of such assets is primarily driven by the nature and
    amount of mineralized material believed to be contained in such
    properties. Production stage mineral interests represent
    interests in operating properties that contain proven and
    probable reserves. Development stage mineral interests represent
    interests in properties under development that contain proven
    and probable reserves. Exploration stage mineral interests
    represent interests in properties that are believed to
    potentially contain mineralized material consisting of
    (i) mineralized material such as inferred material within
    pits; measured, indicated and inferred material with
    insufficient drill spacing to qualify as proven and probable
    reserves; and inferred material in close proximity to proven and
    probable reserves; (ii) around-mine exploration potential
    such as inferred material not immediately adjacent to existing
    reserves and mineralization, but located within the immediate
    mine area; (iii) other mine-related exploration potential
    that is not part of measured, indicated or inferred material and
    is comprised mainly of material outside of the immediate mine
    area; (iv) greenfields exploration potential that is not
    associated with any other production, development or exploration
    stage property, as described above; or (v) any acquired
    right to explore or extract a potential mineral deposit. The
    Company’s mineral rights generally are enforceable
    regardless of whether proven and probable reserves have been
    established. In certain limited situations, the nature of a
    mineral right changes from an exploration



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

right to a mining right upon the establishment of proven and
    probable reserves. The Company has the ability and intent to
    renew mineral interests where the existing term is not
    sufficient to recover all identified and valued proven and
    probable reserves

and/or

undeveloped mineralized material.

Asset
    Impairment

Long-lived
    Assets

The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for
    impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An
    impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future
    cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying
    amount of the assets, including goodwill, if any. An impairment
    loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated
    future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on
    quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other
    commodity prices (considering current and historical prices,
    trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs,
    capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on

life-of-mine

plans. Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond
    proven and probable reserves, including mineralization that is
    not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base,
    are included when determining the fair value of mine site
    reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining
    whether the assets are impaired. The term “recoverable
    minerals” refers to the estimated amount of gold or other
    commodities that will be obtained after taking into account
    losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of
    recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral
    interests are risk adjusted based on management’s relative
    confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows,
    assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are
    identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future
    cash flows from other asset groups. The Company’s estimates
    of future cash flows are based on numerous assumptions and it is
    possible that actual future cash flows will be significantly
    different than the estimates, as actual future quantities of
    recoverable minerals, gold and other commodity prices,
    production levels and operating costs of production and capital
    are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties.

Goodwill

The Company evaluates, on at least an annual basis during the
    fourth quarter, the carrying amount of goodwill to determine
    whether current events and circumstances indicate that such
    carrying amount may no longer be recoverable. To accomplish
    this, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its
    reporting units to their carrying amounts. If the carrying value
    of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the
    Company compares the implied fair value of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill to its carrying amount, and any excess of
    the carrying value over the fair value is charged to earnings.
    The Company’s fair value estimates are based on numerous
    assumptions and it is possible that actual fair value will be
    significantly different than the estimates, as actual future
    quantities of recoverable minerals, gold and other commodity
    prices, production levels, operating costs and capital
    requirements are each subject to significant risks and
    uncertainties.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized, net of treatment and refining charges,
    from a sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    the price is determinable, the product has been delivered, the
    title has been transferred to the customer and collection of the
    sales price is reasonably assured. Revenues from by-product
    sales are credited to

Costs applicable to sales

as a
    by-product credit.

Concentrate sales are initially recorded based on 100% of the
    provisional sales prices. Until final settlement occurs,
    adjustments to the provisional sales prices are made to take
    into account the



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

mark-to-market

changes based on the forward prices for the estimated month of
    settlement. For changes in metal quantities upon receipt of new
    information and assay, the provisional sales quantities are
    adjusted as well. The principal risks associated with
    recognition of sales on a provisional basis include metal price
    fluctuations between the date initially recorded and the date of
    final settlement. If a significant decline in metal prices
    occurs between the provisional pricing date and the final
    settlement date, it is reasonably possible that the Company
    could be required to return a portion of the sales proceeds
    received based on the provisional invoice.

The Company’s sales based on a provisional price contain an
    embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the
    host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the
    receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward
    exchange price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative,
    which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market
    through earnings each period prior to final settlement.

Income and
    Mining Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability
    method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the
    financial reporting basis of the Company’s liabilities and
    assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and
    assets. This method generates either a net deferred income tax
    liability or asset for the Company, as measured by the statutory
    tax rates in effect. The Company derives its deferred income tax
    charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net
    deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year.
    Mining taxes represent Canadian provincial taxes levied on
    mining operations and are classified as income taxes; as such
    taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. With respect
    to the earnings that the Company derives from the operations of
    its consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the
    earnings are indefinitely reinvested, no deferred taxes have
    been provided on the unremitted earnings (including the excess
    of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for
    financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of such equity)
    of these consolidated companies.

The Company’s deferred income tax assets include certain
    future tax benefits. The Company records a valuation allowance
    against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when it
    believes, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more
    likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income
    tax asset will not be realized.

The Company’s operations involve dealing with uncertainties
    and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in
    multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon
    many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in
    various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from
    federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company
    recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for
    anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax
    jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent
    to which, additional taxes will be due. At January 1, 2007,
    the Company adopted guidance for accounting for uncertainty in
    income taxes to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8
    for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves
    in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to
    the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate
    resolution may result in a payment that is materially different
    from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities.
    If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be
    less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to
    expense would result. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves
    to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would
    result. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any,
    related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Reclamation
    and Remediation Costs (Asset Retirement Costs and
    Obligations)

Asset retirement obligations are recognized when incurred and
    recorded as liabilities at fair value. The liability is accreted
    over time through periodic charges to earnings. In addition, the
    asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the asset’s
    carrying value and amortized over the life of the related asset.
    Reclamation costs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes
    in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of
    time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or
    amount of the reclamation and abandonment costs. The asset
    retirement obligation is based on when spending for an existing
    environmental disturbance will occur. The Company reviews, on an
    annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary, the asset
    retirement obligation at each mine site in accordance with ASC
    guidance for accounting for asset retirement obligations.

Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on
    management’s best estimate at the end of each period of the
    costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates
    include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and
    monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are
    reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised.

    Currency

The functional currency for the majority of the Company’s
    operations, including the Australian operations, is the

Derivative
    Instruments

Newmont has fixed forward contracts designated as cash flow
    hedges in place to hedge against changes in foreign exchanges
    rates, fixed forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges in
    place to hedge against changes in diesel prices and fixed to
    floating interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value
    hedges to provide balance to the Company’s mix of fixed and
    floating rate debt. The fair value of derivative contracts
    qualifying as cash flow hedges are reflected as assets or
    liabilities in the balance sheet. To the extent these hedges are
    effective in offsetting forecasted cash flows from production
    costs (the “effective portion”), changes in fair value
    are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
    Amounts deferred in

Accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss)

are reclassified to

,
    as applicable, when the hedged transaction has occurred. The
    ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of the
    derivative is recorded in

Other income, net

in each
    period. Cash transactions related to the Company’s
    derivative contracts accounted for as hedges are classified in
    the same category as the item being hedged in the statement of
    cash flows.

When derivative contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges are
    settled, accelerated or restructured before the maturity date of
    the contracts, the related amount in

at the settlement date is
    deferred and reclassified to

    as applicable, when the originally designated hedged transaction
    impacts earnings.

The fair value of derivative contracts qualifying as fair value
    hedges are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance
    sheet. Changes in fair value are recorded in income in each
    period, consistent with recording changes to the

Newmont assesses the effectiveness of the derivative contracts
    periodically using either regression analysis or the dollar
    offset approach, both retrospectively and prospectively, to
    determine whether the hedging instruments have been highly
    effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged
    items. The Company defines highly effective as the hedge
    contract and the item being hedged being between 0.8 and 1.25
    correlated, and the Company measures the amount of any hedge
    ineffectiveness. The Company will also assess periodically
    whether the hedging instruments are expected to be highly
    effective in the future. If a hedging instrument is not expected
    to be highly effective, the Company will stop hedge accounting
    prospectively. In those instances, the gains or losses remain in

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

until the
    hedged item affects earnings.

Net Income
    (Loss) per Common Share

Basic and diluted income (loss) per share are presented for

Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders

and for

Income (loss) from continuing operations
    attributable to Newmont stockholders

. Basic income (loss)
    per share is computed by dividing income available to common
    shareholders by the weighted-average number of outstanding
    common shares for the period, including the exchangeable shares
    (see Notes 12 and 21). Diluted income per share reflects
    the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
    contracts that may require the issuance of common shares in the
    future were converted. Diluted income per share is computed by
    increasing the weighted-average number of outstanding common
    shares to include the additional common shares that would be
    outstanding after conversion and adjusting net income for
    changes that would result from the conversion. Only those
    securities or other contracts that result in a reduction in
    earnings per share are included in the calculation.

Comprehensive
    Income (Loss)

In addition to

Net income (loss), Comprehensive income (loss)

includes all changes in equity during a period, such as
    adjustments to minimum pension liabilities, foreign currency
    translation adjustments, the effective portion of changes in
    fair value of derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow
    hedges and cumulative unrecognized changes in fair value of
    marketable securities

available-for-sale

or other investments, except those resulting from investments by
    and distributions to owners.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform
    to the 2009 presentation. The Company retrospectively adopted
    ASC guidance for convertible debt instruments which requires an
    allocation of convertible debt proceeds between the liability
    component and the embedded conversion option (i.e., the equity
    component). The Company also adopted the ASC guidance for
    noncontrolling interests, which requires the noncontrolling
    interests to be classified as a separate component of net income
    and equity.

Recently
    Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Subsequent
    Events

In May 2009, the ASC guidance for subsequent events was updated
    to establish accounting and reporting standards for events that
    occur after the balance sheet date but before financial
    statements



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

are issued or are available to be issued. The update sets forth:
    (i) the period after the balance sheet date during which
    management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or
    transactions that may occur for potential recognition or
    disclosure in the financial statements, (ii) the
    circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or
    transactions occurring after the balance sheet in its financial
    statements, and (iii) the disclosures that an entity should
    make about events or transactions occurring after the balance
    sheet date in its financial statements. The Company adopted the
    updated guidance for the interim period ended June 30,
    2009. The adoption had no impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows. See Note 35.

Post-retirement
    Benefit Plans

In December 2008, the ASC guidance for retirement benefits was
    updated to expand the requirements of employers’
    disclosures about post-retirement benefit plan assets in a
    defined benefit pension or other post-retirement plan. The
    objective is to require more detailed disclosures about
    employers’ plan assets, including employers’
    investment strategies, major categories of plan assets,
    concentrations of risk within plan assets, and valuation
    techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets. The
    Company adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2009.
    These disclosures are not required for earlier periods that are
    presented for comparative purposes. See Note 22 for the
    Company’s disclosure of its post-retirement benefit plan
    assets.

Equity Method
    Investments

In November 2008, the ASC guidance for equity method and joint
    venture investments was updated to clarify the accounting for
    certain transactions and impairment considerations involving
    equity method investments. The intent is to provide guidance on:
    (i) determining the initial measurement of an equity method
    investment, (ii) recognizing

other-than-temporary

impairments of an equity method investment and
    (iii) accounting for an equity method investee’s
    issuance of shares. The updated guidance was effective for the
    Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and
    was applied prospectively. The adoption had no impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.

Equity-Linked
    Financial Instruments

In June 2008, the ASC guidance for derivatives and hedging when
    accounting for contracts in an entity’s own equity was
    updated to clarify the determination of whether an instrument
    (or embedded feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock
    which would qualify as a scope exception from hedge accounting.
    The updated guidance was effective for the Company’s fiscal
    year beginning January 1, 2009. The adoption had no impact
    on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results
    of operations.

Accounting for
    Convertible Debt Instruments

In May 2008, the ASC guidance was updated for convertible debt
    instruments that, by their stated terms, may be settled in cash
    (or other assets) upon conversion, including partial cash
    settlement, unless the embedded conversion option is required to
    be separately accounted for as a derivative. The update requires
    that the liability and equity components of convertible debt
    instruments within the scope be separately accounted for in a
    manner that reflects the entity’s nonconvertible debt
    borrowing rate. This requires an allocation of convertible debt
    proceeds between the liability component and the embedded
    conversion option (i.e., the equity component). The difference
    between the principal amount of the debt and the amount of the
    proceeds allocated to the liability component is reported as a
    debt discount and subsequently amortized to earnings over the
    instrument’s expected life using the

effective interest method. The updated guidance required
    retrospective application to all periods presented.

During July 2007, the Company completed an offering of $1,150
    convertible senior notes due 2014 and 2017, each in the amount
    of $575. The 2014 notes maturing on July 15, 2014 pay
    interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.25% per annum, and the
    2017 notes maturing on July 15, 2017 pay interest
    semi-annually at a rate of 1.63% per annum. The notes are
    convertible, at the holder’s option, equivalent to a
    conversion price of $46.21 per share of common stock
    (24,887,956 shares of common stock). In connection with the
    convertible senior notes offering, the Company entered into
    convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions
    (“Call Spread Transactions”). The Call Spread
    Transactions included the purchase of call options and the sale
    of warrants. As a result of the Call Spread Transactions, the
    conversion price of $46.21 was effectively increased to $60.27.
    At December 31, 2009, with the inclusion of the Call Spread
    Transactions, the if-converted value did not exceed the
    principal amounts.

During February 2009, the Company completed an offering of $518
    convertible senior notes due on February 15, 2012. The
    notes will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.00% per
    annum. The notes are convertible, at the holder’s option,
    equivalent to a conversion price of $46.25 per share of common
    stock (11,189,189 shares of common stock). At
    December 31, 2009, the if-converted value exceeded the
    principal amount by $12.

    unamortized debt discount is amortized over the remaining 3, 5
    and 8 year periods of the 2012, 2014 and 2017 convertible
    senior notes, respectively.

Accounting for
    the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

In April 2008, the ASC guidance for Goodwill and Other
    Intangibles was updated to amend the factors that should be
    considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used
    to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset.
    The intent of this update is to improve the consistency between
    the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period
    of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the
    asset under guidance for business combinations. The updated
    guidance was effective for the Company’s fiscal year
    beginning January 1, 2009 and was applied prospectively to
    intangible assets acquired after the effective date. The
    adoption had no impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Derivative
    Instruments

In March 2008, the ASC guidance for derivatives and hedging was
    updated for enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity
    uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and the
    related hedged items are accounted for, and how derivative
    instruments and the related hedged items affect an entity’s
    financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The
    Company adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2009.
    The adoption had no impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See
    Note 15 for the Company’s derivative instruments
    disclosure.

Business
    Combinations

In December 2007, the ASC guidance for business combinations was
    updated to provide new guidance for recognizing and measuring
    identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed,
    and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree. The updated
    guidance also provides disclosure requirements to enable users
    of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
    effects of the business combination. The Company adopted the
    updated guidance on January 1, 2009 and applied it to the
    acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in the Boddington
    project completed on June 25, 2009 (see Note 13).

In April 2009, the guidance was updated to address application
    issues on initial recognition and measurement, subsequent
    measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and
    liabilities arising from contingencies in a business
    combination. This update is effective for assets or liabilities
    arising from contingencies in business combinations for which
    the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The
    adoption of the updated guidance did not have any impact on the
    Company’s acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in
    the Boddington project completed on June 25, 2009 (see
    Note 13).

Noncontrolling
    Interests

In December 2007, the ASC guidance for noncontrolling interests
    was updated to establish accounting and reporting standards
    pertaining to: (i) ownership interests in subsidiaries held
    by parties other than the parent (“noncontrolling
    interests”), (ii) the amount of net income
    attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interests,
    (iii) changes in a parent’s ownership interest, and
    (iv) the valuation of any retained noncontrolling equity
    investment when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. If a subsidiary
    is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment
    in the former subsidiary is



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

measured at fair value and a gain or loss is recognized in net
    income based on such fair value. For presentation and disclosure
    purposes, the guidance requires noncontrolling interests to be
    classified as a separate component of equity. The Company
    adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2009. Except for
    presentation changes, the adoption had no impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows. The Company applied the updated
    guidance when accounting for the Company’s required
    divestiture obligations of PTNNT which resulted in after-tax
    gains of $63 that have been recorded to

Additional paid in
    capital

in 2009. See Note 12.

In January 2010, the guidance for noncontrolling interests was
    further updated to clarify the scope and to require additional
    disclosure when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. The Company
    adopted the updated guidance for the period ended
    December 31, 2009. The adoption had no impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Fair Value
    Accounting

In September 2006, the ASC guidance for fair value measurements
    and disclosure was updated to define fair value, establish a
    framework for measuring fair value, and expand disclosures about
    fair value measurements. The Company adopted the updated
    guidance for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
    recurring basis on January 1, 2008. In February 2008, the
    FASB staff issued an update to the guidance which delayed the
    effective date for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
    liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in
    the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The Company
    adopted the updated guidance for the Company’s nonfinancial
    assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
    basis on January 1, 2009.

In October 2008, the guidance was updated for determining the
    fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset
    is not active. The intent of this update was to provide guidance
    on how the fair value of a financial asset is to be determined
    when the market for that financial asset is inactive. The
    updated guidance states that determining fair value in an
    inactive market depends on the facts and circumstances, requires
    the use of significant judgment and in some cases, observable
    inputs may require significant adjustment based on unobservable
    data. Regardless of the valuation technique used, an entity must
    include appropriate risk adjustments that market participants
    would make for nonperformance and liquidity risks when
    determining fair value of an asset in an inactive market. The
    update was effective upon issuance. The Company has incorporated
    the guidance in determining the fair value of financial assets
    when the market for those assets is not active, specifically its
    marketable debt securities.

In April 2009, the guidance was further updated to provide
    additional guidance on determining fair value when the volume
    and level of activity for the asset or liability have
    significantly decreased and identifying circumstances that
    indicate when a transaction is not orderly. In April 2009, the
    guidance for investments in debt and equity securities was
    updated to: (i) clarify the interaction of the factors that
    should be considered when determining whether a debt security is
    other than temporarily impaired, (ii) provide guidance on
    the amount of an

other-than-temporary

impairment recognized for a debt security in earnings and other
    comprehensive income and (iii) expand the disclosures
    required for

other-than-temporary

impairments for debt and equity securities. Also in April 2009,
    the guidance for financial instruments was updated to require
    disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for
    interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well
    as in annual financial statements. Adoption of this updated
    guidance was required for the Company’s interim reporting
    period beginning April 1, 2009 with early adoption
    permitted. The Company adopted the updated guidance for the
    interim period ended March 31, 2009.

In August 2009, the guidance for fair value measurements and
    disclosure was updated to further define fair value of
    liabilities. This update provides clarification for
    circumstances in which: (i) a quoted



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

price in an active market for the identical liability is not
    available, (ii) the liability has a restriction that
    prevents its transfer, and (iii) the identical liability is
    traded as an asset in an active market in which no adjustments
    to the quoted price of an asset are required. Adoption of this
    guidance was required for the Company’s interim reporting
    period beginning October 1, 2009. The adoption had no
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, guidance to elect the fair value option for
    financial assets and financial liabilities was issued. The
    guidance permits entities to choose to measure many financial
    instruments and certain other items at fair value, with the
    objective of improving financial reporting by mitigating
    volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related
    assets and liabilities differently without having to apply
    complex hedge accounting provisions. The updated guidance was
    adopted January 1, 2008. The Company did not elect the fair
    value option for any of its financial assets or liabilities, and
    therefore, the adoption had no impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows. Refer to Note 14 for further details regarding the
    Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value.

Variable Interest
    Entities

In December 2008, the ASC guidance for disclosures by public
    entities (enterprises) about transfers of financial assets and
    interests in variable interest entities was updated to require
    public entities to provide additional disclosures about
    transfers of financial assets. The updated guidance also
    requires public enterprises to provide additional disclosures
    about their involvement with VIEs. The updated guidance was
    effective for the Company’s fiscal year ending
    December 31, 2008. Newmont has adopted the disclosure
    requirements in the Company’s VIE disclosures.

Accounting for
    Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment
    Awards

In June 2007, the ASC guidance for accounting for income tax
    benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards was updated.
    The updated guidance requires that the tax benefit related to
    dividends and dividend equivalents paid on equity-classified
    nonvested shares and nonvested share units, which are expected
    to vest, be recorded as an increase to additional paid-in
    capital. The updated guidance was applied prospectively for tax
    benefits on dividends declared in the Company’s fiscal year
    beginning January 1, 2008. The adoption had an
    insignificant impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Income
    Taxes

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted updated ASC
    guidance which clarifies the accounting and reporting for
    uncertainties in the application of the income tax laws to the
    Company’s operations. The interpretation prescribes a
    comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition,
    measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax
    provisions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.
    The cumulative effects of applying this interpretation were
    recorded as a decrease in retained earnings of $108, an increase
    of $5 in goodwill, an increase of $4 in noncontrolling
    interests, a decrease in net deferred tax assets of $37
    (primarily, as a result of utilization of foreign tax credits
    and net operating losses as part of the measurement process,
    offset, in part, by the impact of the interaction of the
    Alternative Minimum Tax rules) and an increase of $72 in the net
    liability for unrecognized income tax benefits. Refer to
    Note 8.

The Company’s continuing practice is to recognize interest

and/or

penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its
    income tax expense. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
    total amount of accrued income-tax-related interest and
    penalties included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $13
    and $37, respectively. During 2009, 2008, and 2007 the Company
    accrued through



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss) an additional $9,
    $31, and $27 of interest and penalties, paid $nil, $13, and $12
    of interest, and released $35, $18, and $4 as a result of the
    expiration of statute of limitations

and/or

settlements of audit-related issues. The Company also released
    $8 in 2007 as a result of a change in the tax law.

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns
    in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states and in
    foreign jurisdictions. With limited exception, the Company is no
    longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income or

non-U.S. income

tax audits by taxing authorities for years before 2005.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Variable Interest
    Entities

In June 2009, the ASC guidance for consolidation accounting was
    updated to require an entity to perform a qualitative analysis
    to determine whether the enterprise’s variable interest
    gives it a controlling financial interest in a VIE. This
    analysis identifies a primary beneficiary of a VIE as the entity
    that has both of the following characteristics: (i) the
    power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly
    impact the entity’s economic performance and (ii) the
    obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity
    that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The updated
    guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of the primary
    beneficiary of a VIE. The updated guidance is effective for the
    Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2010. The
    Company is evaluating the potential impact of adopting this
    guidance on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

Fair Value
    Accounting

In January 2010, the ASC guidance for fair value measurements
    and disclosure was updated to require additional disclosures
    related to: i) transfers in and out of level 1 and 2
    fair value measurements and ii) enhanced detail in the
    level 3 reconciliation. The guidance was amended to provide
    clarity about: i) the level of disaggregation required for
    assets and liabilities and ii) the disclosures required for
    inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for
    both recurring and nonrecurring measurements that fall in either
    level 2 or level 3. The updated guidance is effective
    for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1,
    2010, with the exception of the level 3 disaggregation
    which is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2011. The Company is evaluating the potential
    impact of adopting this guidance on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows.

NOTE 3

PRICE-CAPPED
    FORWARD SALES CONTRACTS

In 2001, the Company entered into transactions that closed out
    certain call options. The options were replaced with a series of
    forward sales contracts requiring physical delivery of the same
    quantity of gold over slightly extended future periods. Under
    the terms of the contracts, the Company would realize the lower
    of the spot price on the delivery date or the capped price,
    ranging from $381 to $392 per ounce. The forward sales contracts
    were accounted for as normal sales contracts in accordance with
    ASC guidance for derivative instruments. The initial fair value
    of the forward sales contracts was recorded as deferred revenue,
    and the fair value of these contracts was not included on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In June 2007, the Company paid $578 to settle the
    1.85 million ounce price-capped forward sales contracts.
    The Company reported a $531 pre-tax loss on the early settlement
    of the contracts, after a $47 reversal of previously recognized
    deferred revenue.

MIDAS
    REDEVELOPMENT

In June 2007, a fatal accident occurred at the Midas mine in
    Nevada, which resulted in a temporary suspension of operations
    at the mine to initiate rescue and subsequent recovery efforts.
    As a result, the Mine Safety and Health Administration
    (“MSHA”) issued an order requiring operations to
    temporarily cease at the mine. During the third and fourth
    quarters of 2007, activities were undertaken, at the direction
    of MSHA, to regain entry into the mine in order to resume
    commercial production which restarted in October 2007. The
    redevelopment and holding costs of $11 in 2007 included access
    development, inspection, preventative repairs and road and mill
    maintenance.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On January 1, 2007, the Company began recognizing and
    measuring tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax
    return that directly or indirectly affect amounts reported in
    the financial statements under the ASC income tax guidance. At
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $130,
    $181 and $230 of total gross unrecognized tax benefits,
    respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending
    amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

$


At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, $63, $116 and $84,
    respectively, represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits
    that, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective
    income tax rate.

The Company operates in numerous countries around the world and
    accordingly it is subject to, and pays annual income taxes
    under, the various income tax regimes in the countries in which
    it operates. Some of these tax regimes are defined by
    contractual agreements with the local government, and others are
    defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country.
    The Company has historically filed, and continues to file, all
    required income tax returns and paid the taxes reasonably
    determined to be due. The tax rules and regulations in many
    countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. From
    time to time the Company is subject to a review of its historic
    income tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes
    can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or
    application of certain rules to the Company’s business
    conducted within the country involved.

On June 25, 2008, the United States Tax Court issued an
    opinion for Santa Fe Pacific Gold Company and Subsidiaries
    (“Santa Fe”), by and through its successor in
    interest, Newmont USA Limited, a member of the Newmont Mining
    Corporation affiliated group. The Tax Court issued the ruling
    for the tax years 1994 through 1997, which were years prior to
    Newmont’s acquisition of Santa Fe. The Tax Court ruled
    unfavorably on certain issues relating to the method in which
    Santa Fe was calculating adjustments related to percentage
    depletion in its Alternative Minimum Tax calculation. On
    April 27, 2009, the United States Tax Court issued a
    decision in favor of Santa Fe, with respect to the
    $65 million Homestake

break-up

fee
    deducted by Santa Fe in tax year 1997. Following procedural
    rules, the Internal Revenue Service was given 90 days from
    the date the decision was entered in which to file an appeal.
    The entry of decision was made on July 16, 2009. The
    Internal Revenue Service did not file an appeal, and as a
    result, as of October 15, 2009 the decision stands. The
    result of this decision resulted in overpayments for each of the
    tax years 1994 through 1997.

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns
    in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and
    foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no
    longer subject to U.S. Federal, state and local, and

non-U.S. income

tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2005. As a
    result of (i) statute of limitations that will begin to
    expire within the next 12 months in



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

various jurisdictions, and (ii) possible settlements of
    audit-related issues with taxing authorities in various
    jurisdictions with respect to which none of the issues are
    individually significant, the Company believes that it is
    reasonably possible that the total amount of its net
    unrecognized income tax benefits will decrease between $12 to
    $15 in the next 12 months.

The Company’s continuing practice is to recognize interest

and/or

penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its
    income tax expense. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
    total amount of accrued income-tax-related interest and
    penalties included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $13
    and $37, respectively. During 2009, 2008, and 2007 the Company
    accrued through the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss) an
    additional $9, $31, and $27 of interest and penalties, paid
    $nil, $13, and $12 of interest, and released $35, $18, and $4 as
    a result of the expiration of statute of limitations

and/or

settlements of audit-related issues. The Company also released
    $8 in 2007 as a result of a change in the tax law.

Newmont intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from certain
    foreign operations. Accordingly, U.S. and

non-U.S. income

and withholding taxes for which deferred taxes might otherwise
    be required, have not been provided on a cumulative amount of
    temporary differences (including, for this purpose, any
    difference between the tax basis in the stock of a consolidated
    subsidiary and the amount of the subsidiary’s net equity
    determined for financial reporting purposes) related to
    investments in foreign subsidiaries of approximately $117 and
    $434 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    additional U.S. and

non-U.S. income

and withholding tax that would arise on the reversal of the
    temporary differences could be offset in part, by tax credits.
    Because the determination of the amount of available tax credits
    and the limitations imposed on the annual utilization of such
    credits are subject to a highly complex series of calculations
    and expense allocations, it is impractical to estimate the
    amount of net income and withholding tax that might be payable
    if a reversal of temporary differences occurred.

At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the
    Company had (i) $1,213 and $1,362 of net operating loss
    carry forwards, respectively; and (ii) $279 and $154 of tax
    credit carry forwards, respectively. At December 31, 2009
    and 2008, $1,020 and $1,231, respectively, of net operating loss
    carry forwards are attributable to operations in Australia,
    Ghana and France for which current tax law provides no
    expiration period. The remaining net operating losses available
    are attributable to entities that have various temporal and
    other limitations that may restrict the ultimate realization of
    the tax benefits of such tax attributes.

Tax credit carry forwards for 2009 and 2008 of $158 and $76
    consist of foreign tax credits available in the United States;
    substantially all such credits not utilized will expire at the
    end of 2014. Other credit carry forwards at the end of 2009 and
    2008 in the amounts of $121 and $78, respectively, represent
    alternative minimum tax credits attributable to the
    Company’s U.S. operations for which the current tax
    law provides no period of expiration.

The Company reviews the measurement of its deferred tax assets
    at each balance sheet date. All available evidence, both
    positive and negative, is considered in determining whether,
    based upon the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than
    not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not
    be realized. The Company decreased the valuation allowance
    related to deferred tax assets by $32 during 2009. Additionally,
    the valuation allowance was also decreased in 2009 by $45
    primarily for capital losses in Australia that were written off
    during the year that had no impact on the Company’s
    effective tax rate. In addition, $44 of the valuation allowance,
    when recognized, will not reduce the Company’s effective
    tax rate, but will be recorded directly to equity. The valuation
    allowance remaining at the end of 2009 primarily is attributable
    to

non-U.S. subsidiaries

tax loss carryforwards.

AGR Matthey
    Joint Venture

Newmont holds a 40% interest in the AGR Matthey Joint Venture
    (“AGR”), a gold refinery, with Johnson Matthey
    (Australia) Ltd. and the West Australian Mint holding the
    remaining interests. Newmont has no guarantees related to this
    investment. Newmont received dividends of $2, $nil and $2 during
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, from its interests in AGR.
    See also Note 27 for details of Newmont’s transactions
    with AGR.

Regis
    Resources NL

Prior to December 2009, Newmont held a 23.15% interest in Regis
    Resources NL (“Regis Resources”), a gold exploration
    company with substantial landholdings in Western Australia.
    Newmont has no guarantees related to this investment. On
    December 22, 2009, Regis Resources issued common shares
    through a rights issue. As a result, Newmont’s ownership
    interest in Regis Resources was diluted to 14.82% and we
    discontinued equity accounting for our investment in Regis
    Resources.

European Gold
    Refineries

Prior to May 1, 2008, Newmont held a 46.72% interest in
    European Gold Refineries (“EGR”), sole owner of
    Valcambi SA, a London Good Delivery precious metals refiner and
    manufacturer of precious metal coins, medallions and luxury
    watch components. See Note 13 for a discussion of the
    acquisition of additional shares resulting in the consolidation
    of EGR in 2008.

La Zanja

Newmont holds a 46.94% interest in La Zanja, a gold project
    near the city of Cajamarca, Peru. The remaining interests are
    held by CompanTHORNia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A.
    (“Buenaventura”). The mine is being developed by and
    will be operated by Buenaventura. The construction of
    La Zanja is approximately 50% complete and production is
    expected to begin in the third quarter of 2010. The site will
    consist of two small open pits and one oxide leach pad that will
    produce approximately 450,000 ounces of gold (Newmont’s
    share will be approximately 210,000 ounces) over its seven year
    life.

Euronimba

Newmont holds a 43.5% interest in Euronimba, an iron ore project
    located in the Republic of Guinea. The remaining interests are
    held by BHP Billiton (43.5%) and Areva (13%). Euronimba is in
    the early stages of development and it is currently estimated
    that production will begin in 2018. Approximately
    600 million tons of iron ore, mainly hematite, will be
    mined over the project’s 20 plus year estimated life.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE

Discontinued operations include the Kori Kollo operation sold in
    July 2009, the royalty portfolio and Pajingo operation, both
    sold in December 2007 and the Zarafshan operation expropriated
    by the Uzbekistan government in 2006.

In July 2009, the Company sold its interest in the Kori Kollo
    operation in Bolivia. As part of the transaction, a reclamation
    trust fund was established with the proceeds to be made
    available exclusively to pay for closure and reclamation costs
    when operations eventually cease. The Company recorded a $13
    liability for the trust fund and recognized a $16 charge, net of
    tax benefits.

In December 2007, the Company sold substantially all of
    Pajingo’s assets for cash and marketable equity securities
    totaling $23 resulting in a gain of $8. Additional Pajingo asset
    sales resulted in a gain of $1 in 2008.

In June 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a
    plan to cease Merchant Banking activities. As part of this plan,
    Newmont decided to dispose of the royalty portfolio assets and a
    portion of the marketable equity securities portfolio and to
    cease further investments in marketable equity securities that
    do not support the core gold mining business. In June 2007,
    Newmont recorded a $1,665 non-cash charge to impair the goodwill
    associated with the Merchant Banking Segment. In December 2007,
    Newmont received net cash proceeds of $1,187 and recognized a
    gain of $905 related to the sale of the royalty portfolio. In
    2008, Newmont recognized additional royalty portfolio revenue of
    $6 in excess of the 2007 estimate and recorded a $19 tax benefit
    related to the US tax return

true-up

on
    the sale of the royalty portfolio.

The Company’s interest in the Zarafshan operation was
    expropriated by the Uzbekistan government in 2006. In 2007,
    after pursuing international arbitration, Newmont received
    proceeds of $80 and recognized a gain of $77 related to the
    settlement.

Newmont has accounted for these dispositions in accordance with
    accounting guidance for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
    assets. The Company has reclassified the balance sheet amounts

    Indonesian subsidiary that operates Batu Hijau, to PT Multi
    Daerah Bersaing (“PTMDB”) in compliance with
    divestiture obligations under the Contract of Work, reducing
    NTP’s ownership interest to 63% from 80%. Newmont has a

    remaining 43.75%. Newmont

    structures and contractual relationships. The share transfers
    resulted in gains of approximately $63 (after tax of $115) that
    have been recorded in

Additional paid in capital

. As a
    result of the sale, Newmont’s ownership in Batu Hijau was

In December 2009, Newmont entered into a transaction with
    P.T. Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an unrelated
    noncontrolling partner of PTNNT, whereby the Company agreed to
    advance certain funds to PTPI in exchange for a pledge of the
    noncontrolling partner’s 20% share of PTNNT dividends, net
    of withholding tax, and the assignment of its voting rights to
    the Company. As a result, PTPI was determined to be a VIE as it
    has minimal equity capital and the voting rights to its 20%
    interest in PTNNT reside with Newmont.

Based on the above transaction, the Company recognized an
    additional 17% effective economic interest in PTNNT. Combined
    with the Company’s 56.25% ownership in NTP, Newmont has a
    52.44% effective economic interest in PTNNT and continues to
    consolidate Batu Hijau in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2007, because PTPI had been advanced a loan by NTP and was
    not obligated to absorb the expected losses of PTNNT,
    PTPI’s interest was considered a carried interest and
    Newmont reported a 52.88% economic interest in Batu Hijau, which
    reflected Newmont’s actual economic interest in the mine
    until such time as the loan was fully repaid (including accrued
    interest). On May 25, 2007, PTPI fully repaid the loan
    (including accrued interest) from NTP. As a result of the loan
    repayment, Newmont’s economic interest in Batu Hijau was
    reduced from 52.88% to 45% and

Net income attributable to
    noncontrolling interests

increased by $25 (after-tax) in the
    second quarter of 2007.

Newmont has a 51.35% ownership interest in Minera Yanacocha
    SR.L. (“Yanacocha”), with the remaining interests held
    by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. (43.65%) and the
    International Finance Corporation (5%).

Newmont Common
    Stock

In October 2007, Newmont filed a shelf registration statement on

Form S-3

under which it can issue an indeterminate number or amount of
    common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of
    debt securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate
    prices. It also included the resale of an indeterminate amount
    of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time
    to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible
    securities.

The Company paid common stock dividends of $0.40 per share in
    2009, 2008 and 2007.

Treasury
    Stock

Treasury stock is acquired by the Company when certain
    restricted stock awards vest or are forfeited (see
    Note 23). At vesting, a participant has a tax liability
    and, pursuant to the participant’s award agreement, may
    elect withholding of restricted stock to satisfy tax withholding
    obligations. The withheld or forfeited stock is accounted for as
    treasury stock and carried at the par value of the related
    common stock.

Exchangeable
    Shares

In connection with the acquisition of Franco-Nevada Corporation
    (“Franco”) in February 2002, certain holders of Franco
    common stock received 0.8 of an exchangeable share of Newmont
    Mining Corporation of Canada Limited (formerly Franco) for each
    share of common stock held. These exchangeable shares are
    convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of Newmont
    common stock on a

one-for-one

basis, and entitle holders to dividends and other rights
    economically equivalent

Call Spread
    Transactions

In connection with the issuance of $1,150 of convertible notes
    in July 2007 (see Note 21), the Company entered into
    separate convertible note hedge transactions and separate
    warrant transactions with respect to the Company’s common
    stock to minimize the impact of the potential dilution upon
    conversion of the convertible notes. The Company purchased call
    options in private transactions to cover 24,887,956 shares
    of the Company’s common stock at a strike price of $46.21
    per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, for
    approximately $366. The call options generally allow the Company
    to receive shares of the Company’s common stock from
    counterparties equal to the number of shares of common stock
    payable to the holders of the notes upon conversion. The Company
    also sold warrants in private transactions permitting the
    purchasers to acquire up to 24,887,956 shares of the
    Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $60.27,
    subject to adjustments in certain circumstances, for total
    proceeds of approximately $248.

The Company has analyzed the Call Spread Transactions under ASC
    guidance for derivative financial instruments indexed to and
    potentially settled in a company’s own stock and other
    relevant literature, and determined that they meet the criteria
    for classification as equity transactions. As a result, the
    Company recorded the purchase of the call options as a reduction
    in additional paid-in capital and the proceeds of the warrants
    as an addition to paid-in capital, and the Company will not
    recognize subsequent changes in fair value of the instruments.

Net Income
    (Loss) per Common Share

Basic income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing
    income available to common shareholders by the weighted average
    number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
    income (loss) per common share is computed similarly to basic
    income per common share except that the weighted average number
    of common shares outstanding is increased to include the number
    of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if
    the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.

Options to purchase 4.2 million, 4.4 million and
    1.7 million shares of common stock at average exercise
    prices of $46.58, $47.63 and $52.76 were outstanding at
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, but were
    not included in the computation of diluted weighted average
    number of common shares because their effect would have been
    anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. Other outstanding
    options to purchase 1.4 million shares of common stock were
    not included in the computation of diluted weighted average
    common shares in 2007 because their effect would have been
    anti-dilutive.

In February 2009, the Company completed a public offering of
    34,500,000 shares of common stock at $37 per share for net
    proceeds of $1,234.

In February 2009 and July 2007, Newmont issued $518 and $1,150,
    respectively, of convertible notes that, if converted in the
    future, would have a potentially dilutive effect on the
    Company’s stock. Under the indentures for the convertible
    notes, upon conversion Newmont is required to settle the
    principal amount of the convertible notes in cash and may elect
    to settle the remaining conversion obligation (stock price in
    excess of the conversion price) in cash, shares or a combination
    thereof. The effect of contingently convertible instruments on
    diluted earnings per share is calculated under the net share
    settlement method in accordance with accounting guidance for
    earnings per share. Under the net share settlement method, the
    Company includes the amount of shares it would take to satisfy
    the conversion obligation, assuming that all of the convertible
    notes are surrendered. The average closing price of the
    Company’s common stock for each of the periods presented is
    used as the basis for determining dilution. The average price of
    the Company’s common stock for all periods presented did
    not exceed the conversion price of $46.25 and $46.21 for the
    notes issued in 2009 and 2007, respectively, and therefore, did
    not have a dilutive effect on earnings per share.

In connection with the 2007 convertible senior notes offering,
    the Company entered into Call Spread Transactions. These
    transactions included the purchase of call options and the sale
    of warrants. As a result of the Call Spread Transactions, the
    conversion price of $46.21 was effectively increased to $60.27.
    Should the warrant transactions become dilutive to the
    Company’s earnings per share (i.e. Newmont’s share
    price exceeds $60.27) the underlying shares will be included in
    the computation of diluted income per common share.

ACQUISITIONS

On June 25, 2009 the Company completed the acquisition of
    the remaining 33.33% interest in Boddington from AngloGold
    Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). The valuation
    date for the transaction was January 1, 2009, and closing
    adjustments were made to reflect Newmont’s economic
    ownership from that date. Consideration for the acquisition
    consisted of $750 less an $8 closing adjustment paid in cash at
    closing, $240 paid in cash in December 2009, and a contingent
    royalty

    recognized this as part of the purchase price. At
    December 31, 2009, the fair value of the contingent
    consideration was revalued to approximately $85 and the increase
    in fair value of $23 was recorded to

    Amounts are payable under the contingent royalty beginning in
    the second quarter of 2010. The range of undiscounted amounts
    the Company could pay is between $0 and $100. The fair value of
    the contingent royalty recognized was estimated by applying the
    income approach. See Note 14 for a description of the key
    inputs used in deriving fair value.

In connection with the acquisition, Newmont incurred transaction
    costs of $67 (shown in Note 6,

    including Australian stamp duties; only $15 of these costs were
    paid at December 31, 2009. Additionally, in June 2009,

    In November 2008, EGR repurchased 6.55% of its own shares from a
    noncontrolling shareholder bringing Newmont’s ownership to
    60.64%.

In December 2007, the Company purchased approximately 70% of the
    common shares of Miramar Mining Corporation
    (“Miramar”), which, in addition to the shares
    previously owned, brought the Company’s interest in Miramar
    to approximately 78%. During the first quarter of 2008, the
    Company completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of
    Miramar bringing its interest to 100%. All shares were purchased
    for C$6.25 per share in cash.

With the completion of the Miramar acquisition, the Company
    controls the Hope Bay project, a large undeveloped gold property
    in Nunavut, Canada. The acquisition and development of the Hope
    Bay project is consistent with the Company’s strategic
    focus on generating value through exploration and project
    development and was acquired with the intention of adding higher

FAIR VALUE
    ACCOUNTING

Fair value accounting establishes a fair value hierarchy that
    prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
    fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to
    unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest
    priority



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three
    levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible
    at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or
    liabilities;

Level 2

Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are
    observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
    full term of the asset or liability; and

Level 3

Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both
    significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable
    (supported by little or no market activity).

The following table sets forth the Company’s assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at
    least annually) by level within the fair value hierarchy. As
    required by accounting guidance, assets and liabilities are
    classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input
    that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The Company’s cash equivalent instruments are classified
    within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are
    valued using quoted market prices. The cash equivalent
    instruments that are valued based on quoted market prices in
    active markets are primarily money market securities and
    U.S. Treasury securities.

The Company’s marketable equity securities are valued using
    quoted market prices in active markets and as such are
    classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The
    fair value of the marketable equity securities is calculated as
    the quoted market price of the marketable equity security
    multiplied by the quantity of shares held by the Company.

The Company’s corporate marketable debt securities are
    valued using quoted market prices in active markets and as such
    are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
    The Company’s other marketable debt securities include
    investments in asset backed commercial paper and auction rate
    securities. In January 2009, the investments in asset backed
    commercial paper were restructured



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

under court order. The restructuring allowed a return of a
    portion of the investment and interest distribution to be made
    to investors. The Company estimated the fair value of the asset
    backed commercial paper using a probability of return to each
    class of notes reflective of information reviewed regarding the
    separate classes of securities. The auction rate securities are
    traded in markets that are not active, trade infrequently and
    have little price transparency. The Company estimated the fair
    value of the auction rate securities based on weighted average
    risk calculations. The asset backed commercial paper and auction
    rate securities are classified within Level 3 of the fair
    value hierarchy.

The Company’s net trade receivable from provisional copper
    and gold concentrate sales is valued using quoted market prices
    based on the forward London Metal Exchange (“LME”)
    (copper) and the London Bullion Market Association P.M. fix
    (“London P.M. fix”) (gold) and, as such, is classified
    within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company’s derivative instruments are valued using
    pricing models and the Company generally uses similar models to
    value similar instruments. Where possible, the Company verifies
    the values produced by its pricing models to market prices.
    Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including
    contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit spreads,
    measures of volatility, and correlations of such inputs. The
    Company’s derivatives trade in liquid markets, and as such,
    model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve
    significant management judgment. Such instruments are classified
    within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company has fixed to floating swap contracts to hedge the
    interest rate risk exposure of its


/


%
    uncollateralized senior notes due May 2011. The hedged portion
    of the Company’s


/


% senior
    notes is valued using pricing models which require inputs,
    including risk-free interest rates and credit spreads. Because
    the inputs are derived from observable market data, the hedged
    portion of the


/


% senior
    notes is classified within Level 2 of the fair value
    hierarchy.

The Company has recorded a contingent consideration liability
    related to the acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in
    Boddington (Note 13). The value of the contingent
    consideration was determined using a valuation model which
    simulates future gold and copper prices and costs applicable to
    sales to estimate fair value. The contingent consideration
    liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value
    hierarchy.

DERIVATIVE
    INSTRUMENTS

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes
    in the gold and copper prices by selling our gold and copper

Cash Flow
    Hedges

Foreign Currency
    Contracts

Newmont utilizes foreign currency contracts to reduce the
    variability of the US dollar amount of forecasted foreign
    currency expenditures caused by changes in exchange rates.
    Newmont hedges up to 80% of the Company’s IDR denominated
    operating expenditures which results in a blended IDR/$ rate
    realized each period. The hedging instruments are fixed forward
    contracts with expiration dates ranging up to one year from the
    date of issue. The principal hedging objective is reduction in
    the volatility of realized

period-on-period

IDR/$ rates. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the IDR/$ fixed forward
    contracts increased Batu Hijau

Costs applicable to sales

by $nil and $2, and reduced Batu Hijau

Costs applicable
    to sales

by $4, respectively. At December 31, 2009, the
    Company has hedged 32% of its expected 2010 IDR operating
    expenditures.

The Company hedges up to 85% of the Company’s A$
    denominated operating expenditures with fixed forward contracts
    that have expiration dates ranging up to three years from the
    date of issue. The principal hedging objective is reduction in
    the volatility of realized

period-on-period

$/A$ rates. Each month, fixed forward contracts are obtained to
    hedge 1/36th of the forecasted monthly A$ operating cost
    exposure in the rolling three-year hedge period resulting in a
    blended $/A$ rate realized. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the A$
    operating hedging instruments increased Other Australia/New
    Zealand

Costs applicable to sales

by $7 and $13, and
    reduced Other Australia/New Zealand

Costs applicable to sales

by $1, respectively. During 2009, the A$ operating hedge
    instruments decreased Boddington

Costs applicable to sales

by $2. At December 31, 2009, the Company has hedged
    60%, 37% and 13% of its expected 2010, 2011 and 2012 A$
    operating expenditures, respectively.

The Company hedges up to 75% of the Company’s NZ$
    denominated operating expenditures with fixed forward contracts
    that have expiration dates ranging up to two years from the date
    of issue. The principal hedging objective is reduction in the
    volatility of realized

period-on-period

$/NZ$ rates. Each month, fixed forward contracts are obtained to
    hedge 1/24th of the forecasted monthly NZ$ operating cost
    exposure in the rolling two-year hedge period resulting in a
    blended $/NZ$ rate realized. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the NZ$
    operating hedging instruments increased Other Australia/New
    Zealand

Costs applicable to sales

by $2, $2 and $nil. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company has hedged 61% and 21% of
    its expected 2010 and 2011 NZ$ operating expenditures,
    respectively.

The Company hedged A$ denominated capital expenditures related
    to the construction of Boddington. The hedging instruments
    consisted of a series of fixed forward contracts and bought call
    option contracts with expiration dates ranging up to one year
    from the date of issue. The $30 net realized loss
    associated with the capital expenditure hedge program was

Diesel Fixed
    Forward Contracts

Newmont hedges up to 66% of its operating cost exposure related
    to diesel consumed at its Nevada operations to reduce the
    variability in realized diesel prices. The hedging instruments
    consist of a series of financially settled fixed forward
    contracts with expiration dates ranging up to two years from the
    date of issue. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Nevada diesel
    hedge program increased Nevada

Costs applicable to sales

by $11, $4 and $nil, respectively. The contracts have been
    designated as cash flow hedges of future diesel purchases, and
    as such, the effective portion of unrealized changes in the
    market value have been recorded in

Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss)

and are recorded in earnings
    during the period in which the hedged transaction affects
    earnings. Gains and losses from hedge ineffectiveness are
    recognized in current earnings. At December 31, 2009, the
    Company has hedged 55% and 20% of its expected 2010 and 2011
    Nevada diesel expenditures, respectively.

Newmont had the following diesel derivative contracts

Treasury Rate
    Lock Contracts

In connection with the 2019 and 2039 notes issued in September
    2009, Newmont acquired treasury rate lock contracts to reduce
    the variability of the proceeds realized from the bond
    issuances. The treasury rate locks resulted in $6 and $5
    unrealized gains for the 2019 and 2039 notes, respectively. The
    Company previously acquired treasury rate locks in connection
    with the issuance of the 2035 notes that resulted in a $10
    unrealized loss. The gains/losses from these contracts are
    recognized in

Interest expense, net

over the terms of the
    respective notes.

Copper Collar
    Contracts

Prior to 2007, the Company entered into copper collar contracts
    to hedge the copper price realized during those periods. Final
    delivery under the copper collar contracts occurred in February
    2007. Changes in the fair value related to the effective portion
    of the hedges were recorded in

Interest Rate
    Swap Contracts

At December 31, 2009, Newmont had $222 fixed to floating
    swap contracts designated as a hedge against its


/


% senior
    notes due 2011. The interest rate swap contracts assist in
    management of the Company’s targeted mix of fixed and
    floating rate debt. Under the hedge contract terms, the Company
    receives fixed-rate interest payments at 8.63% and pays
    floating-rate interest amounts based on periodic London
    Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) settings plus a
    spread, ranging from 2.60% to 7.63%. The interest rate swap
    contracts were designated as fair value hedges and, as such,
    changes in fair value have been recorded in income in each
    period, consistent with recording changes to the mark- to-market
    value of the underlying hedged liability in income. Changes in
    the

mark-to-market

value of the effective portion of the interest rate swap
    contracts are recognized as a component of

Interest expense,

The hedge contracts decreased

Interest expense, net

by $4, $2 and $nil during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    During 2009, 2008 and 2007, losses of $3 and gains of $4 and $3

Provisional
    Copper and Gold Sales

LME copper prices averaged $2.34 per pound during 2009, compared
    with the Company’s recorded average provisional price of
    $2.53 per pound before

mark-to-market

gains and treatment and refining charges. The applicable forward
    copper price at the end of the year was $3.34 per pound. During
    2009, increasing copper prices resulted in a provisional pricing

mark-to-market

gain of $173 ($0.33 per pound). At December 31, 2009, the
    Company had copper sales of 160 million pounds priced at an
    average of $3.34 per pound, subject to final pricing over the
    next several months.

The average London P.M. gold fix was $973 per ounce during 2009,
    compared with the Company’s recorded average provisional
    gold price of $977 per ounce before

mark-to-market

gains and treatment and refining charges. The applicable forward
    gold price at the end of the year was $1,094 per ounce. During
    2009, changes in gold prices resulted in a provisional pricing

mark-to-market

gain of $15 ($2 per ounce). At December 31, 2009, the
    Company had gold sales of 85,000 ounces priced at an average of
    $1,094 per ounce, subject to final pricing over the next several
    months.

Price-capped
    Forward Sales Contracts

In June 2007, we paid $578 to settle all of the
    1.85 million ounce price-capped forward sales contracts
    which were accounted for as normal sales contracts under
    accounting for derivative instruments. We reported a $531
    pre-tax loss on the early settlement of the contracts, after a
    $47 reversal of previously recognized deferred revenue in 2007.

During 2009, the Company purchased marketable equity securities
    of Regis Resources for $5. During 2008, the Company purchased
    marketable equity securities of Gabriel Resources for $11 and
    other marketable equity securities for $6.

Included in

Investments

at December 31, 2009, are
    $10 and $5 of long-term marketable debt securities and long-term
    marketable equity securities, respectively, that are legally
    pledged for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations
    related to the San Jose Reservoir at Yanacocha.

During 2009, the Company recognized impairments for

other-than-temporary

declines in value of $2 for Shore Gold Inc. and $4 for other
    marketable equity securities. During 2008, the Company
    recognized impairments for other-than- temporary declines in
    value of $67 for Shore Gold Inc., $23 for Gabriel Resources Ltd.
    and $24 for other marketable equity securities.

The following tables present the gross unrealized losses and
    fair value of the Company’s investments with unrealized
    losses that are not deemed to be

The unrealized loss of $8 and $11 in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, relate to the Company’s investments in
    marketable equity securities, auction rate securities and asset
    backed commercial paper as listed in the December 31, 2009
    and 2008 tables above. While the fair values of these
    investments are below their respective cost, the Company views
    these declines as temporary. Generally the Company’s policy
    is to treat a decline in a marketable equity security’s
    quoted market value that has lasted continuously for more than
    six months as an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. The Company intends to hold its investment in
    auction rate securities and asset backed commercial paper until
    maturity or such time that the market recovers and therefore
    considers these losses temporary.

Sale-Leaseback
    of Refractory Ore Treatment Plant

In September 1994, the Company entered into a sale and leaseback
    agreement for its refractory ore treatment plant located in
    Carlin, Nevada. The lease term is 21 years and aggregate
    future minimum lease payments, which include interest, were $226
    and $263 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    Future minimum lease payments are $36 in 2010, $39 in 2011, $70
    in 2012, $36 in 2013, $36 in 2014 and $9 thereafter. The lease
    includes purchase options during and at the end of the lease at
    predetermined prices. The interest rate on this sale-leaseback
    transaction is 6.36%. In connection with this transaction, the
    Company entered into certain interest rate hedging contracts
    that were settled for a gain of $11, which is recognized as a
    reduction of interest expense over the term of the lease.
    Including this gain, the effective interest rate on the
    borrowing is 6.15%. The related asset is specialized, therefore
    it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of this debt.

% Senior
    Notes

Newmont has outstanding uncollateralized senior notes with a
    principal amount of $223 due May 2011 bearing an annual interest
    rate of 8.63%. Interest is paid semi-annually in May and
    November and the senior notes are redeemable prior to maturity
    under certain conditions. Newmont has contracts to hedge the
    interest rate risk exposure on $222 of these senior notes. The
    Company receives fixed-rate interest payments at 8.63% and pays
    floating-rate interest based on periodic London Interbank
    Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) settings plus a spread, ranging
    from 2.60% to 7.63% (see Note 15). Using prevailing
    interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value
    of these senior notes was $242 and $225 at December 31,
    2009, and 2008, respectively. The foregoing fair

value estimate was prepared with the assistance of an
    independent third party and may or may not reflect the actual
    trading value of this debt.

Corporate
    Revolving Credit Facility

The Company has an uncollateralized $2,000 revolving credit
    facility with a syndicate of commercial banks, which matures in
    April 2012. The facility contains a letter of credit

sub-facility.

Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the credit
    ratings of the Company’s senior, uncollateralized,
    long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest at
    an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.28% or the
    lead bank’s prime interest rate. The margin adjusts as the
    Company’s credit rating changes. Facility fees accrue at an
    annual rate of 0.07% of the aggregate commitments. The Company
    also pays a utilization fee of 0.05% on the amount of revolving
    credit loans and letters of credit outstanding under the
    facility for each day on which the sum of such loans and letters
    of credit exceed 50% of the commitments under the facility. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the facility fees were 0.07% of
    the commitment. There was $452 and $519 outstanding under the
    letter of credit

    Convertible Senior Notes

In February 2009, the Company issued $518 of convertible senior
    notes maturing on February 15, 2012 for net proceeds of
    $504. The notes pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.0% per
    annum and the effective interest rate is 8.5%. The notes are
    convertible, at the holder’s option, equivalent to a
    conversion price of $46.25 per share of common stock. Upon
    conversion, the principle amount and all accrued interest will
    be repaid in cash and any conversion premium will be settled in
    shares of our common stock or, at our election, cash or any
    combination of cash and shares of our common stock. When the
    conversion premium becomes dilutive to the Company’s
    earnings per share (Newmont’s share price exceeds $46.25)
    the shares will be included in the computation of diluted income
    per common share. The Company is not entitled to redeem the
    notes prior to their stated maturity dates. Using prevailing
    interest rates on similar instruments, the estimated fair value
    of these senior notes was $580 at December 31, 2009. The
    foregoing fair value estimates were prepared with the assistance
    of an independent third party and may or may not reflect the
    actual trading value of this debt.

2014 and 2017
    Convertible Senior Notes

In July 2007, the Company issued $1,150 convertible senior notes
    due in 2014 and 2017, each with a principal amount of $575 for
    net proceeds of $1,126. The 2014 Notes, maturing on
    July 15, 2014, pay interest semi-annually at a rate of
    1.25% per annum, and the 2017 Notes, maturing on July 15,
    2017, pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.63% per annum.
    The effective interest rates are 6.0% and 6.25% for the 2014 and
    2017 notes, respectively. The Notes are convertible, at the
    holder’s option, at a conversion price of $46.21 per share
    of common stock. Upon conversion, the principle amount and all
    accrued interest will be repaid in cash and any conversion
    premium will be settled in shares of our common stock or, at our
    election, cash or any combination of cash and shares of our
    common stock. In connection with the convertible senior notes
    offering, the Company entered into convertible note hedge
    transactions and warrant transactions (“Call Spread
    Transactions”). The Call Spread Transactions included the
    purchase of call options and the sale of warrants. As a result
    of the Call Spread Transactions, the conversion price of $46.21
    was effectively increased to $60.27. When the conversion premium
    and call spread transactions become dilutive to the
    Company’s earnings per share (Newmont’s share price
    exceeds $46.21 and $60.27, respectively) the underlying shares
    will be included in the computation of diluted income per common
    share. The Company is not

entitled to redeem the notes prior to their stated maturity
    dates. Using prevailing interest rates on similar instruments,
    the estimated fair value of the 2014 and 2017 senior notes was
    $584 and $517, respectively, at December 31, 2009. The
    foregoing fair value estimates were prepared with the assistance
    of an independent third party and may or may not reflect the
    actual trading value of this debt.

2019 and 2039
    Senior Notes

In September 2009, the Company completed a two part public
    offering of $900 and $1,100 senior notes maturing on
    October 1, 2019 and October 1, 2039, respectively. Net
    proceeds from the 2019 and 2039 notes were $895 and $1,080,
    respectively. The 2019 notes pay interest semi-annually at a
    rate of 5.13% per annum and the 2039 notes pay semi-annual
    interest of 6.25% per annum. Using prevailing interest rates on
    similar instruments, the estimated fair value of the 2019 and
    2039 senior notes was $901 and $1,080, respectively, at
    December 31, 2009. The foregoing fair value estimates were

Project
    Financings

PTNNT Project
    Financing Facility

PTNNT has a project financing facility with a syndicate of
    banks. The scheduled repayments of this debt are semi-annual
    installments of $43 through November 2010 and $22 from May 2011
    through November 2013. Amounts outstanding under the project
    financing were $220 and $306 at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The Company provided letters of credit to the Senior Lenders to
    secure 56.25% of the PTNNT project financing facility and
    substantially all of PTNNT’s assets are pledged as
    collateral. The carrying value of the property, plant and mine
    development was $1,275 and $1,359 at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Under the terms of the project financing
    facility, PTNNT maintains an escrow account for the next
    interest and principal installment due. Such amounts totaled $47
    and $nil at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and
    was included in other long-term assets.

The interest rate is based on blended fixed and floating rates.
    At market rates on December 31, 2009, the weighted average
    interest rate for the floating rate portion approximated LIBOR
    plus 1.2%. The fixed rate portion had an interest rate of 7.7%.
    The total weighted average interest rates including the fixed
    and floating rate portions were 4.2%, 5.6% and 6.9% during 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively, and the interest rates were 2.9%
    and 4.9% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    fair market value cannot be practicably determined due to the
    lack of available market information for this type of debt.

Through mid-October 2009, the Company provided a joint and
    several guarantee for the payment of principal and interest
    amounts associated with the PTNNT project financing facility,
    which was non-recourse to Newmont at December 31, 2008. On
    October 21, 2009, the Company provided letters of

credit to the Senior Lenders to secure 56.25% of the PTNNT
    project financing facility, and as a result, the Company no
    longer provides a separate corporate guarantee in support of the
    financing.

PTNNT Shareholder
    Loans

PTNNT has shareholder subordinated loan agreements
    (“Shareholder Loans”) with Newmont Indonesia Limited
    (“NIL”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newmont, and
    Nusa Tenggara Mining Corporation (“NTMC”), an
    affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation, with substantially the same
    terms for each shareholder. The loan principal and interest was
    fully paid on November 23, 2009. Accordingly, total
    principal outstanding under these Shareholder Loans was $nil and
    $41 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Payments
    of $72 and $nil were made to NTMC during 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Borrowings under the Shareholder Loans were
    guaranteed by Nusa Tenggara Partnership (“NTP”) and
    payable on demand, subject to the Senior Debt subordination
    terms. The 2008 Shareholder Loans are based on the
    six-month London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”)
    plus 8% for principal and LIBOR rate plus 9% for any unpaid
    accrued interest. The weighted average interest rates were 9.4%,
    10.6% and 8.4% during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and the
    interest rates were 9.2% and 10.6% at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively.

Newmont and NTMC provided a contingent support line of credit to
    PTNNT. Funding of $124 and $41 provided in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, was under this contingent agreement. In November
    2009, the loan principal and interest were fully paid and
    Newmont is no longer committed to provide this contingent
    support. Finally, subject to certain conditions, there is
    additional contingent support from NTP of $20 (Newmont’s
    pro-rata share is $11) in respect of Senior Debt obligations
    payable during 2009 and 2010, resulting from any debt service
    shortfall, if applicable.

Yanacocha

Credit Facility.

During 2006, Yanacocha
    entered into an uncollateralized $100 bank financing with a
    syndicate of Peruvian commercial banks. Quarterly repayments
    commenced in May 2007 with final maturity May 2014. Payments of
    $14 and $14 were made in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Borrowings
    under the facility bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.88%.
    The loan is uncollateralized and non-recourse to Newmont. The
    estimated fair value of this credit facility approximates the
    carrying value at December 31, 2009.

Senior Notes.

During 2006, Yanacocha issued
    $100 of senior notes into the Peruvian capital markets under a
    $200 senior note program. The issuance is comprised of $42 of
    floating interest rate senior notes bearing interest at a rate
    of LIBOR plus 1.44% and $58 of fixed rate senior notes bearing
    an annual interest of 7.0%. Quarterly repayments commence in
    July 2010 for six years. The senior notes are uncollateralized
    and are non-recourse to Newmont. The estimated fair value of
    these senior notes approximates the carrying value at
    December 31, 2009.

$24 from Banco de Credito del Peru
    Leasing.

During 2007, Yanacocha acquired nine
    haul trucks through a capital lease agreement with Banco de
    Credito del Peru. Monthly repayments began in January 2008 and
    continue for three years. The lease bears interest at an annual
    fixed rate of 6.10%.

$16 from Bank of Nova Scotia Leasing.

During
    2007, Yanacocha signed a $16 capital lease agreement with the
    Scotia Bank to acquire six haul trucks. At December 2009 and
    2008, as per the lease agreement, Yanacocha was committed to the
    bank for $16. Monthly repayments began in February 2008 and
    continue for three years. The lease bears interest at an annual
    fixed rate of 6.00%.

    (“IFC”) ($75) and a commercial lender ($10). NGGL
    borrowed $75 from the IFC in December 2008 and borrowed the
    remaining $10 in February 2009. Amounts borrowed are guaranteed
    by Newmont. Semi-annual payments through April 2017 are
    required. Borrowings bear interest of LIBOR plus 3.5%.

Debt
    Covenants

The Company’s senior notes and sale-leaseback of the
    refractory ore treatment plant debt facilities contain various
    covenants and default provisions including payment defaults,
    limitation on liens, limitation on sales and leaseback
    agreements and merger restrictions.

The Ahafo project facility contains a financial ratio covenant
    requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of
    cash and cash equivalents) to EBITDA (earnings before interest
    expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of
    less than or equal to 4.0 and a net debt to total capitalization
    ratio of less than or equal to 62.5%.

In addition to the covenants noted above, the corporate
    revolving credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant
    requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of
    cash and cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less
    than or equal to 62.5%. Furthermore, the corporate revolving
    credit facility contains covenants limiting the sale of all or
    substantially all of the Company’s assets, certain change
    of control provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets.

Certain of the Company’s project debt facilities contain
    debt covenants and default provisions including limitations on
    dividends subject to certain debt service cover ratios,
    limitations on sales of assets, negative pledges on certain
    assets, restricted payments to partners, change of control
    provisions and limitations of additional permitted debt.

At December 31, 2009, the Company and its related entities
    were in compliance with all debt covenants and provisions
    related to potential defaults.

Pension
    Plans

The Company’s pension plans include: (1) two qualified
    non-contributory defined benefit plans (for salaried employees
    and substantially all domestic hourly union employees);
    (2) one non-qualified plan (for salaried employees whose
    benefits under the qualified plan are limited by federal
    legislation); (3) two qualified plans for salaried and
    hourly Canadian employees; (4) one non-qualified plan for
    employees of PTNNT; (5) an international plan for select
    employees who are not eligible to participate in the

U.S.-based

plans because of citizenship; (6) one non-qualified plan
    for certain members of the board of directors; (7) one
    non-qualified plan for former employees under terminated plans;
    and (8) two qualified plans for salaried and hourly
    employees of the former Miramar operations, acquired in December
    2007. The vesting period for plans identified in (1) and
    (2) is five years of service. These plans’ benefit
    formulas are based on an employee’s years of credited
    service and either (i) such employee’s highest
    consecutive five years average pay (salaried plan/final average
    pay formula) (ii) such employees annual salary (salaried
    plan/stable value formula) or (iii) a flat dollar amount
    adjusted by a service-weighted multiplier (hourly plan). The
    Canadian plan provides for full vesting of benefits upon
    remittance and the benefit formula is based on a percentage of
    annual pay. The PTNNT plan is based on Indonesian Labor Law and
    provides for benefits to employees at age 55 or if
    employment is terminated at mine closing. The benefits formula
    under the Indonesian Labor Law is based on an employee’s
    current salary and years of service prior to retirement or
    termination of employment at mine closing. The international
    retirement plan’s basic and savings accounts have a graded
    vesting schedule and are fully vested after four years of
    service. The international retirement plan’s supplemental
    account is vested after attaining age 55 with 10 years
    of service or attaining age 62. The plan’s benefit
    formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in
    the plan document. The Company amended the international
    retirement plan in 2009 such that only individuals

    CORPORATION

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

who were in the plan at December 31, 2009 are eligible for
    benefits and no additional contributions or credits will be made
    to any participant in the plan. Participants may elect to
    receive a distribution of the vested value in the
    participant’s account either at retirement or as an
    in-service distribution. The Company recorded an insignificant
    decrease to

Other income, net

as a result of the plan
    curtailment. The former Miramar operation’s plans will
    continue for current retired members and no additional employees
    will become eligible for benefits under these plans.

Pension costs are determined annually by independent actuaries
    and pension contributions to the qualified plans are made based
    on funding standards established under the Employee Retirement
    Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

Other Benefit
    Plans

The Company provides defined medical and life insurance benefits
    to selected qualified U.S. and Canadian retirees (generally
    salaried employees and to a limited extent their eligible
    dependents). In general, participants become eligible for these
    benefits upon retirement directly from the Company if they are
    at least 55 years old and, for U.S. employees, the
    combination of their age and years of service with the Company
    equals 75 or more. This benefit is not provided to employees who
    joined the Company after January 1, 2003.

Defined medical benefits cover most of the reasonable and
    customary charges for hospital, surgical, diagnostic and
    physician services and prescription drugs. Life insurance
    benefits are based on a percentage of final base annual salary
    and decline over time after retirement commences. The majority
    of the costs of these medical and life insurance benefits are
    paid by the Company. In 2003, the Company began a strategy to
    more equitably share costs with retirees and at
    December 31, 2009, 75% of retiree medical coverage cost is
    paid by the Company. Qualified retirees that became eligible
    after January 1, 2003 are required to contribute additional
    amounts to the medical coverage.

Under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
    Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”), beginning in
    2006, the Act provides a prescription drug benefit under
    Medicare Part D, as well as a federal subsidy to plan
    sponsors of retiree healthcare plans that provide a prescription
    drug benefit to their participants that is at least actuarially
    equivalent to the benefit that is available under Medicare. The
    Company sponsors retiree health care plans that provide
    prescription drug benefits to eligible retirees that our plan
    actuaries have determined are actuarially equivalent to Medicare
    Part D. The effect of the Act was to decrease
    post-retirement projected accumulated benefit obligation by $7
    and $8 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The Company’s qualified pension plans are funded with cash
    contributions in compliance with Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”) rules and regulations. The Company’s
    non-qualified and other benefit plans are currently not funded,
    but exist as general corporate obligations. The information
    contained in the above tables indicates the combined funded
    status of qualified and non-qualified plans, in accordance with
    accounting pronouncements. Assumptions used for IRS purposes
    differ from those used for accounting purposes. The funded
    status shown above compares the projected benefit obligation
    (“PBO”) of all plans, which is an actuarial present
    value of obligations that takes into account assumptions as to
    future compensation levels of plan participants, to the fair
    value of the assets held in trust for the qualified plans.
    Accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”), which is an
    actuarial present value of benefits (whether vested or
    nonvested) attributed to employees based on employee service and

Yield curves matching our benefit obligations were derived using
    a cash flow analysis under the Citigroup above median pension
    discount curve. The Citigroup above median pension discount
    curve shows the relationship between interest rates and duration
    for hypothetical zero coupon investments. Under this approach,
    Treasury par curve data is used to set the shape of the yield
    curve and calculate the AA corporate spot yield at each

based on an analysis of the actual plan asset returns over
    multiple time horizons and review of assumptions used by other
    U.S. corporations with defined benefit plans of similar
    size and investment strategy and is reviewed periodically by the
    audit committee. The average actual return on plan assets during
    the 21 years ended December 31, 2009 approximated 8%.

The pension plans employ several independent investment firms
    which invest the assets of the plan in certain approved funds
    that correspond to specific asset classes with associated target
    allocations. Depending upon actual sector performance, the
    assets in the plan are periodically rebalanced to match the
    established target levels for the asset classes. The goal of the
    pension fund investment program is to achieve prudent actuarial
    funding ratios while maintaining acceptable risk levels. The
    investment performance of the plan and that of the individual
    investment firms is measured against recognized market indices.
    This performance is monitored by an investment committee
    comprised of members of the Company’s management, which is
    advised by an independent investment consultant. The performance
    of the plan is reviewed at least annually with the Audit
    Committee of the Company’s board of directors. With the
    exception of global capital market economic risks, the Company
    has identified no significant portfolio risks associated to
    asset classes. The following is a summary of the target asset
    allocations for 2009 and the actual asset allocation at
    December 31, 2009.

The following table sets forth the Company’s pension plan

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are classified
    within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are
    valued using quoted market prices. The cash equivalent
    instruments that are valued based on quoted market prices in
    active markets are primarily money market securities and
    U.S. Treasury securities.

The Company’s commingled fund investments are classified
    within Level 2. The funds are managed by several fund
    managers and are valued at the net asset value per share for
    each fund. Although the majority of underlying assets in the
    funds consist of actively traded equity securities and bonds,
    the unit of account is considered to be at the fund level, and
    therefore, the investments are classified as Level 2. At
    December 31, 2009, the underlying assets of the commingled
    funds consist of U.S. equity investments (40%),
    international equity investments (25%) and fixed income
    investments (35%).

Savings
    Plans

The Company has two qualified defined contribution savings
    plans, one that covers salaried and non-union hourly employees
    and one that covers substantially all hourly union employees. In
    addition, the Company has one non-qualified supplemental savings
    plan for salaried employees whose benefits under the qualified
    plan are limited by federal regulations. When an employee meets
    eligibility requirements, the Company matches 100% of employee
    contributions of up to 6% of base salary for the salaried and
    hourly plans. Effective March 2008, the Company makes a
    contribution between 5.0% and 7.5% (based on continuous years of
    service) to each non-union employee’s retirement
    contribution account at its sole discretion. Matching
    contributions are made with Newmont stock; however, no holding
    restrictions are placed on such contributions, which totaled $15
    in 2009, $14 in 2008 and $13 in 2007.

NOTE 23

STOCK BASED
    COMPENSATION

The Company has stock incentive plans for executives and
    eligible employees. Stock incentive awards include options to
    purchase shares of stock with exercise prices not less than fair
    market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant and
    restricted stock units. At December 31, 2009,
    12,078,606 shares were available for future stock incentive
    plan awards. The Company also maintains prior stock incentive
    plans, but no longer grants awards under these plans.

Employee Stock
    Options

Stock options granted under the Company’s stock incentive
    plans vest over periods of three years or more and are
    exercisable over a period of time not to exceed 10 years
    from the grant date. The value of each option award is estimated
    at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
    The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of
    subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the
    option award and stock price volatility. The expected term of
    options granted is derived from historical data on employee
    exercise and post-vesting employment termination experience.
    Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our
    stock at the grant date. These estimates involve inherent
    uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment.
    In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture
    rate and only recognize expense for those options expected to
    vest. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our
    recorded stock based compensation expense would have been
    different from that reported. The Black-Scholes option-pricing
    model used the following assumptions:

Other Stock
    Based Compensation

The Company grants restricted stock units to executives and
    eligible employees upon achievement of certain financial and
    operating results. Restricted stock units vest over periods of
    three years or more. Prior to vesting, holders of restricted
    stock units do not have the right to vote the underlying shares;
    however, executives accrue dividend equivalents on their
    restricted stock units, which are paid at the time the
    restricted stock units vest. The restricted stock units are
    subject to forfeiture risk and other restrictions. Upon vesting,
    the employee is entitled to receive one share of the
    Company’s common stock for each restricted stock unit. In
    2009, 2008 and 2007 the Company granted 450,195, 16,360 and
    20,212 restricted stock units, respectively, at a
    weighted-average fair market value of $42, $39 and $45,
    respectively, per underlying share of the Company’s common
    stock. The increase in restricted stock units granted during
    2009 compared to previous years is due to the restructuring of
    other stock based compensation programs discussed below. At
    December 31, 2009, 420,383, 7,527 and nil shares remain
    unvested for the 2009, 2008 and 2007 grants, respectively.

Beginning in 2009, the Company grants financial performance
    stock bonuses to eligible executives upon achievement of certain
    financial and operating results, based on a targeted number of
    shares at the beginning of each performance period. At the end
    of the performance period, one third of the bonus is paid in
    common stock and two-thirds of the bonus is paid in restricted
    stock units that vest in equal annual increments at the second
    and third anniversaries of the start of the performance period.
    In 2009, the Company granted 40,078 common shares and 80,172
    restricted stock units included in the restricted stock unit
    grants above at a fair market value of $43 per underlying share
    of the Company’s common stock under the financial
    performance stock bonus plan.

Prior to 2009, the Company granted restricted stock awards to
    executives and deferred stock awards to eligible employees upon
    achievement of certain financial and operating results. Shares
    of restricted stock and deferred stock vest over periods of
    three years or more from the grant date and are subject to
    certain restrictions related to ownership and transferability
    prior to vesting. The Company no longer grants restricted stock
    or deferred stock. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, nil, 218,697 and
    175,114 shares of restricted stock, respectively, were
    granted at a weighted-average fair market value of $39 and $44

    respectively. At December 31, 2009, 158,376 and
    30,362 shares remained unvested for the 2008 and 2007
    restricted stock awards, respectively. In 2008 and 2007, the
    Company granted 394,095 and 365,776 shares of deferred
    stock, respectively, at a weighted-average fair market value of
    $44 and $42 per underlying share of the Company’s common

    deferred stock awards, respectively.

In 2009, 475,577 other stock based compensation awards vested.
    The total fair value of other stock based compensation awards
    that vested in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $19, $14 and $21,
    respectively. At December 31, 2009, there was $27 of

RECLAMATION AND
    REMEDIATION LIABILITIES (ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS)

The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject
    to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the
    protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are
    continually changing and are generally becoming more
    restrictive. The Company conducts its operations to protect
    public health and the environment and believes its operations
    are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all
    material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in
    the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and
    regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future
    expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based
    principally on legal and regulatory requirements.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, $698 and $594, respectively,
    were accrued for reclamation obligations relating to currently
    or recently producing mineral properties. In addition, the
    Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental
    obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining
    activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and
    implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, $161 and $163, respectively,

SEGMENT AND
    RELATED INFORMATION

Newmont predominantly operates in a single industry, namely
    exploration for and production of gold. The Company’s
    reportable segments are based upon the Company’s management
    organization structure that is focused on the geographic region
    for the company’s operations and include North America,
    South America, Asia Pacific, Africa and Corporate and Other.
    Newmont’s major operations include Nevada, Yanacocha,
    Boddington, Other Australia/New Zealand, Batu Hijau and Ahafo.
    The Company identifies its reportable segments as those
    consolidated mining operations or functional groups that
    represent more than 10% of the combined revenue, profit or loss
    or total assets of all reported operating segments. Consolidated
    mining operations or functional groups not meeting this
    threshold are aggregated at the applicable geographic region or
    corporate level for segment reporting purposes. Earnings from
    operations do not reflect general corporate expenses, interest
    (except project-specific interest) or income taxes (except for
    equity investments). Intercompany revenue and expense amounts
    have been eliminated within each segment in order to report on
    the basis that management uses internally for evaluating segment
    performance.

Segment results for 2009, 2008 and 2007 reflect an
    organizational change, effective in the first quarter of 2009,
    that (i) moved the results of the La Herradura
    operation in Mexico to North America from Other and
    (ii) combined the management of exploration and advanced
    projects, research and development activities under one
    executive and assigned the legacy exploration segment to the
    regional reportable segments. As a result of management’s
    decision to dispose of the Kori Kollo operation in Bolivia, Kori
    Kollo has been reclassified to discontinued operations.

    (35%), $1,618 (30%) and $876 (20%), respectively, of total gold
    sales. Additionally in 2008, the Company had sales to BNP
    Paribas that totaled $1,239 (23%) of total gold sales.

NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NOTE 33

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES

General

The Company follows ASC guidance in determining its accruals and
    disclosures with respect to loss contingencies. Accordingly,
    estimated losses from loss contingencies are accrued by a charge
    to income when information available prior to issuance of the
    financial statements indicates that it is probable (greater than
    a 75% probability) that a liability could be incurred and the
    amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal expenses
    associated with the contingency are expensed as incurred. If a
    loss contingency is not probable or reasonably estimable,
    disclosure of the loss contingency is made in the financial
    statements when it is at least reasonably possible that a
    material loss could be incurred.

Operating
    Segments

The Company’s operating segments are identified in
    Note 31. Except as noted in this paragraph, all of the
    Company’s commitments and contingencies specifically
    described in this Note 33 relate to the Corporate and Other
    reportable segment. The Nevada Operations matters under Newmont
    USA Limited relate to the North America reportable segment. The
    PT Newmont Minahasa Raya matters relate to the Asia Pacific
    reportable segment. The Yanacocha matters relate to the South
    America reportable segment. The Newmont Yandal Operations Pty
    Limited matter relates to the Asia Pacific reportable segment.
    The PTNNT matters relate to the Asia Pacific reportable segment.

Environmental
    Matters

The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject
    to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the
    environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing
    and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company
    conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and
    environment and believes its operations are in compliance with
    applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The
    Company has made, and expects to make in the future,
    expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but
    cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.

Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on
    legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2009 and
    2008, $698 and $594, respectively, were accrued for reclamation
    costs relating to mineral properties in accordance with asset
    retirement obligation accounting guidance. The current portions
    of $36 and $43 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively,
    are included in

Other current liabilities

.

In addition, the Company is involved in several matters
    concerning environmental obligations associated with former
    mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing
    and implementing remediation plans at the various sites
    involved. The Company believes that the related environmental
    obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature
    with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk
    profile and the compliance required to meet general
    environmental standards. Based upon the Company’s best
    estimate of its liability for these matters, $161 and $163 were
    accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. These amounts are included in

Other current
    liabilities

and

Reclamation and remediation
    liabilities

. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these
    matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible
    that the liability for these matters could be as much as 148%
    greater or 3% lower than the amount accrued at December 31,
    2009. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed
    periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the
    time. Changes in estimates are recorded in

Other expense, net

in the period estimates are revised.

Details about certain of the more significant matters involved
    are discussed below.



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Dawn Mining
    Company LLC (“Dawn”) — 51% Newmont
    Owned

Midnite Mine Site.

Dawn previously leased an
    open pit uranium mine, currently inactive, on the Spokane Indian
    Reservation in the State of Washington. The mine site is subject
    to regulation by agencies of the U.S. Department of
    Interior (the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land
    Management), as well as the United States Environmental
    Protection Agency (“EPA”).

In 1991, Dawn’s mining lease at the mine was terminated. As
    a result, Dawn was required to file a formal mine closure and
    reclamation plan. The Department of Interior commenced an
    analysis of Dawn’s proposed plan and alternate closure and
    reclamation plans for the mine. Work on this analysis has been
    suspended indefinitely. In mid-2000, the mine was included on
    the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
    (“CERCLA”). In March 2003, the EPA notified Dawn and
    Newmont that it had thus far expended $12 on the Remedial
    Investigation/Feasibility Study (“RI/FS”) under
    CERCLA. In October 2005, the EPA issued the RI/FS on this
    property in which it indicated a preferred remedy that it
    estimated to cost approximately $150. Newmont and Dawn filed
    comments on the RI/FS with the EPA in January 2006. On
    October 3, 2006, the EPA issued a final Record of Decision
    in which it formally selected the preferred remedy identified in
    the RI/FS.

On January 28, 2005, the EPA filed a lawsuit against Dawn
    and Newmont under CERCLA in the U.S. District Court for the
    Eastern District of Washington. The EPA has asserted that Dawn
    and Newmont are liable for reclamation or remediation work and
    costs at the mine. Dawn does not have sufficient funds to pay
    for the reclamation plan it proposed or for any alternate plan,
    or for any additional remediation work or costs at the mine.

On July 14, 2008, after a bench trial, the Court held
    Newmont liable under CERCLA as an “operator” of the
    Midnite Mine. The Court previously ruled on summary judgment
    that both the U.S. Government and Dawn were liable under
    CERCLA. On October 17, 2008 the Court issued its written
    decision in the bench trial. The Court found Dawn and Newmont
    jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for past and future
    response costs, and ruled that each of Dawn and Newmont are
    responsible to pay one-third of such costs. The Court also found
    the U.S. Government liable on Dawn’s and
    Newmont’s contribution claim, and ruled that the
    U.S. Government is responsible to pay one-third of all past
    and future response costs. In November 2008, all parties
    appealed the Court’s ruling. Also in November 2008, the EPA
    issued an Administrative Order pursuant to Section 106 of
    CERCLA ordering Dawn and Newmont to conduct water treatment,
    testing and other preliminary remedial actions. Newmont has
    initiated those preliminary remedial actions. However, the issue
    of whether the EPA’s current preferred remedy is consistent
    with the National Contingency Plan has not yet come before the
    Court.

Newmont intends to continue to vigorously defend this matter and
    cannot reasonably predict the outcome of this lawsuit or the
    likelihood of any other action against Dawn or Newmont arising
    from this matter.

Dawn Mill Site.

Dawn also owns a uranium mill
    site facility, located on private land near Ford, Washington,
    which is subject to state and federal regulation. In late 1999,
    Dawn sought and later received approval from the State of
    Washington for a revised closure plan that expedites the
    reclamation process at the site. The currently approved plan for
    the site is guaranteed by Newmont.

Newmont Canada
    Limited (“Newmont Canada”) — 100% Newmont
    Owned

On November 11, 2008, St.

Andrew
    Goldfields Ltd. (“St. Andrew”) filed an Application in
    the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, Canada, seeking a
    declaration to clarify St. Andrew’s royalty



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

obligations regarding certain mineral rights and property
    formerly owned by Newmont Canada and now owned by St. Andrew.

Newmont Canada purchased the property, called the Holt-McDermott
    property (“Holt Property”), from Barrick Gold
    Corporation (“Barrick”) in October 2004. At that time,
    Newmont Canada entered into a royalty agreement with Barrick
    (the “Barrick Royalty”), allowing Barrick to retain a
    royalty on the Holt Property. In August 2006, Newmont Canada
    sold all of its interests in the Holt Property to Holloway
    Mining Company (“Holloway”) in exchange for common
    stock issued by Holloway. In September 2006, Newmont Canada
    entered into a purchase and sale agreement with St. Andrew (the
    “2006 Agreement”), under which St. Andrew acquired all
    the common stock of Holloway. In 2008, Barrick sold its Barrick
    Royalty to Royal Gold, Inc. (“Royal Gold”).

In the court proceedings, St.

Andrew alleged
    that in the 2006 Agreement it only agreed to assume royalty
    obligations equal to 0.013% of net smelter returns from
    operations on the Holt Property. Such an interpretation of the
    2006 Agreement would make Newmont responsible for any royalties
    exceeding that amount payable to Royal Gold pursuant to the
    Barrick Royalty. On July 23, 2009, the Court issued a
    decision finding in favor of St. Andrews’ interpretation.
    On August 21, 2009, Newmont Canada appealed the decision.
    Newmont Canada intends to continue to vigorously defend this
    matter but cannot reasonably predict the outcome.

Newmont Capital
    Limited (“Newmont Capital”) — 100% Newmont
    Owned

In February 1999, the EPA placed the Lava Cap mine site in
    Nevada County, California on the National Priorities List under
    CERCLA. The EPA then initiated a RI/FS under CERCLA to determine
    environmental conditions and remediation options at the site.
    Newmont Capital owned the property for approximately three years
    from 1984 to 1986 but never mined or conducted exploration at
    the site. The EPA asserted that Newmont Capital was responsible
    for clean up costs incurred at the site. In February 2009, the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
    approved the related consent decree and the settlement with
    respect to all aspects of this matter, except for future
    potential Natural Resource Damage claims, was completed.

Newmont USA
    Limited — 100% Newmont Owned

Pinal Creek.

Newmont was a defendant in a
    lawsuit brought on November 5, 1991 in U.S. District
    Court in Arizona by the Pinal Creek Group, alleging that Newmont
    and others are responsible for some portion of costs incurred to
    address groundwater contamination emanating from copper mining
    operations located in the area of Globe and Miami, Arizona. Two
    former subsidiaries of Newmont, Pinto Valley Copper Corporation
    and Magma Copper Company (now known as BHP Copper Inc.) owned
    some of the mines in the area between 1983 and 1987. In February
    2010, Newmont settled all claims and liabilities in this matter
    and such settlement is subject to court approval, which is
    expected in March 2010.

Gray Eagle Mine Site.

By letter dated
    September 3, 2002, the EPA notified Newmont that the EPA
    had expended $3 in response costs to address environmental
    conditions associated with a historic tailings pile located at
    the Grey Eagle Mine site near Happy Camp, California, and
    requested that Newmont pay those costs. The EPA has identified
    four potentially responsible parties, including Newmont. Newmont
    does not believe it has any liability for environmental
    conditions at the Grey Eagle Mine site, and intends to
    vigorously defend any formal claims by the EPA. Newmont cannot
    reasonably predict the likelihood or outcome of any future
    action against it arising from this matter.

Ross-Adams Mine Site.

By letter dated
    June 5, 2007, the U.S. Forest Service notified Newmont
    that it had expended approximately $0.3 in response costs to
    address environmental conditions at the



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Ross-Adams mine in Prince of Wales, Alaska, and requested
    Newmont USA Limited pay those costs and perform an Engineering
    Evaluation/Cost Analysis (“EE/CA”) to assess what
    future response activities might need to be completed at the
    site. Newmont does not believe it has any liability for
    environmental conditions at the site, and intends to vigorously
    defend any formal claims by the EPA. Newmont has agreed to
    perform the EE/CA. Newmont cannot reasonably predict the
    likelihood or outcome of any future action against it arising
    from this matter.

PT Newmont
    Minahasa Raya (“PTNMR”) — 80% Newmont
    Owned

On March 22, 2007, an Indonesian non-governmental
    organization named Wahana Lingkungan Hidup Indonesia
    (“WALHI”) filed a civil suit against PTNMR the Newmont
    subsidiary that operated the Minahasa mine in Indonesia, and
    Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and
    Ministry for the Environment, alleging pollution from the
    disposal of mine tailings into Buyat Bay, and seeking a court
    order requiring PTNMR to fund a

25-year

monitoring program in relation to Buyat Bay. In December 2007,
    the court ruled in PTNMR’s favor and found that
    WALHI’s allegations of pollution in Buyat Bay were without
    merit. In March 2008, WALHI appealed this decision to the
    Indonesian Supreme Court.

Independent sampling and testing of Buyat Bay water and fish, as
    well as area residents, conducted by the World Health
    Organization and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and
    Industrial Research Organization, confirm that PTNMR has not
    polluted the Buyat Bay environment, and, therefore, has not
    adversely affected the fish in Buyat Bay or the health of nearby
    residents. The Company remains steadfast that it has not caused
    pollution or health problems.

Newmont Ghana
    Gold Limited (“NGGL”) — 100% Newmont
    Owned

On October 8, 2009, an overflow of processing solution
    occurred at the Ahafo Mines in Ghana operated by Newmont’s
    subsidiary, NGGL. A panel of the Minister of Environment,
    Science & Technology of the Government of Ghana (the
    “Panel”) was appointed to evaluate the overflow
    incident. In January 2010, NGGL received notification of the
    findings of the Panel, which recognized that there was no
    regulatory framework by which to assess compensation or
    penalties relating to such incidents. However, the Panel
    recommended that compensation of seven million Ghana Cedis
    (approximately $5) be paid by NGGL to the Ghanaian Government to
    be used for community compensation and for other uses by the
    Government. In January 2010, NGGL has committed to pay the
    compensation and is working with the Ghana Government to execute
    the payment. NGGL has also confirmed that it is implementing
    appropriate corrective measures related to the incident.

Other Legal
    Matters

Minera Yanacocha
    S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) — 51.35% Newmont
    Owned

Choropampa.

In June 2000, a transport
    contractor of Yanacocha spilled approximately 151 kilograms of
    elemental mercury near the town of Choropampa, Peru, which is
    located 53 miles (85 kilometers) southwest of the Yanacocha
    mine. Elemental mercury is not used in Yanacocha’s
    operations but is a by-product of gold mining and was sold to a
    Lima firm for use in medical instruments and industrial
    applications. A comprehensive health and environmental
    remediation program was undertaken by Yanacocha in response to
    the incident. In August 2000, Yanacocha paid under protest a
    fine of 1,740,000 Peruvian soles (approximately $0.5) to the
    Peruvian government. Yanacocha has entered into settlement
    agreements with a number of individuals impacted by the
    incident. As compensation for the disruption and inconvenience
    caused by the incident, Yanacocha entered into agreements with
    and provided a variety of public works in the three communities

impacted by this incident. Yanacocha cannot predict the
    likelihood of additional expenditures related to this matter.

Additional lawsuits relating to the Choropampa incident were
    filed against Yanacocha in the local courts of Cajamarca, Peru,
    in May 2002 by over 900 Peruvian citizens. A significant number
    of the plaintiffs in these lawsuits entered into settlement
    agreements with Yanacocha prior to filing such claims. In April
    2008, the Peruvian Supreme Court upheld the validity of these
    settlement agreements, which should result in the dismissal of
    all claims brought by previously settled plaintiffs. Yanacocha
    has also entered into settlement agreements with approximately
    350 additional plaintiffs. The claims asserted by approximately
    200 plaintiffs remain. Neither Newmont nor Yanacocha can
    reasonably estimate the ultimate loss relating to such claims.

    Operations Pty Ltd (“NYOL”) — 100% Newmont
    Owned

On September 3, 2003, J. Aron &
    Co.

commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of
    New South Wales (Australia) against NYOL, its subsidiaries and
    the administrator in relation to the completed voluntary
    administration of the NYOL group. J. Aron & Co., a
    NYOL creditor, initially sought injunctive relief that was
    denied by the court on September 8, 2003. On
    October 30, 2003, J. Aron & Co. filed a statement
    of claim alleging various deficiencies in the implementation of
    the voluntary administration process and seeking damages and
    other relief against NYOL and other parties. Newmont entered
    into settlement discussions with the claimants J.
    Aron & Co, and the fund administrators. In December
    2009 Newmont and the claimants reached a settlement agreement,
    which was approved by the court.

PT Newmont Nusa
    Tenggara (“PTNNT”) — 35.44% Newmont
    Owned

Under the Batu Hijau Contract of Work, beginning in 2006 and
    continuing through 2010, a portion of PTNNT’s shares must
    be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or,
    second, to Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between
    the following percentages and the percentage of shares already
    owned by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if
    such number is positive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by
    March 31, 2007; 37% by March 31, 2008; 44% by
    March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. As PT
    Pukuafu Indah (“PTPI”), an Indonesian national, has
    owned a 20% interest in PTNNT, in 2006 a 3% interest was
    required to be offered for sale and in each of 2007 through 2010
    an additional 7% interest must be offered (for an aggregate 31%
    interest). The price at which such interest must be offered for
    sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of the
    then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares would
    be accepted for listing on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, or the
    fair market value of such interest as a going concern, as agreed
    with the Indonesian government.

PTPI has owned and continues to own a 20% interest in PTNNT, and
    therefore the Newmont-Sumitomo partnership was required to offer
    a 3% interest in PTNNT for sale in 2006 and an additional 7%
    interest in each of 2007 through 2010. In accordance with the
    Contract of Work, an offer to sell a 3% interest was made to the
    Indonesian government in 2006 and an offer for an additional 7%
    interest was made in each of 2007 and 2008. A further 7%
    interest in the shares of PTNNT was offered for sale in March
    2009. While the central government declined to participate in
    the 2006 and 2007 offers, local governments in the area in which
    the Batu Hijau mine is located expressed interest in acquiring
    shares, as did various Indonesian nationals. In January 2008,
    the Newmont-Sumitomo partnership agreed to sell, under a carried
    interest arrangement, 2% of PTNNT’s shares to Kabupaten
    Sumbawa, one of the local governments, subject to satisfaction
    of closing conditions. The Indonesian government subsequently
    stated that it would not approve the transfer of shares under
    this agreement. On February 11, 2008, PTNNT received
    notification from the Department of Energy and Mineral



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Resources (“DEMR”) alleging that PTNNT is in breach of
    its divestiture requirements under the Contract of Work, and
    threatening to issue a notice to terminate the Contract of Work
    if PTNNT did not agree to divest the 2006 and 2007 shares,
    in accordance with the direction of the DEMR, by
    February 22, 2008, which date was extended to March 3,
    2008. A second Notice of Default was received relating to the
    alleged failure to divest the 2008 shares as well. On
    March 3, 2008, the Indonesian government filed for
    international arbitration as provided under the Contract of
    Work, as did PTNNT. In the arbitration proceeding, PTNNT sought
    a declaration that the Indonesian government is not entitled to
    terminate the Contract of Work and additional declarations
    pertaining to the procedures for divesting the shares. For its
    part, the Indonesian government sought declarations that PTNNT
    is in default of its divestiture obligations, that the
    government may terminate the Contract of Work and recover
    damages for breach of the Contract of Work, and that PTNNT must
    cause shares subject to divestiture to be sold to certain local
    governments.

Subsequent to an additional 7% interest in PTNNT being offered
    by NTP for sale on March 28, 2008 (as required under the
    Contract of Work), the Director General of Mineral, Coal and
    Geothermal Resources at DEMR claimed that PTNNT breached its
    obligations under the Contract of Work by allowing shares to be
    offered for sale that are pledged to the Senior Lenders as
    security for the repayment of the senior debt. In the letter,
    the Director General claimed that NTP would be in default under
    the Contract of Work if the shares of PTNNT offered for sale in
    March 2008, together with the shares offered in 2006 and 2007,
    were not in the possession of “Indonesian government

and/or

government owned entities,” free of any such senior pledge,
    by July 13, 2008. Consequently, on July 10, 2008,
    PTNNT filed a notice to commence an additional international
    arbitration proceeding, as provided for under the Contract of
    Work, to resolve the claim that PTNNT breached its obligations
    under the Contract of Work by allowing shares to be offered that
    are subject to pledge obligations to the Senior Lenders. This
    issue was incorporated into and resolved as part of the initial
    arbitration proceeding.

An international arbitration panel was appointed to resolve
    these claims and a hearing was held in Jakarta in December 2008.
    On March 31, 2009, the arbitration panel issued its Final
    Award and decision on the matter. In its decision, the
    arbitration panel determined that PTNNT’s foreign
    shareholders had not complied with the divestiture procedure
    required by the Contract of Work in 2006 and 2007, but the panel
    ruled that the Indonesian government is not entitled to
    immediately terminate the Contract of Work and the panel
    rejected the Indonesian government’s claim for damages. The
    Arbitration Panel granted PTNNT 180 days from the date of
    notification of the Final Award to transfer the 2006 3% interest
    and the 2007 7% interest in PTNNT to the local governments or
    their respective nominees. The Arbitration Panel also applied a

180-day

cure
    period to the 2008 7% interest, ruling that PTNNT must (within
    such

180-day

period) offer the 2008 7% interest to the Indonesian government
    or its nominee, and transfer such shares if, after agreement on
    the transfer price, the Indonesian government invokes its right
    of first refusal under the Contract of Work. The panel ruled
    that shares offered to the Indonesian government pursuant to the
    Contract of Work must be offered free of any pledge or
    obligation to re-pledge the shares to the Senior Lenders.
    Finally, the Panel directed PTNNT to pay to the Indonesian
    government an allocated portion of certain legal fees and costs
    of the arbitration. PTNNT submitted payment of $2 for legal fees
    and costs. The Company also entered a formal agreement with the
    Senior Lenders under which the Senior Lenders released the
    pledge on the aggregated 31% of shares in PTNNT that are subject
    to divestiture requirements in exchange for the Company and
    Sumitomo agreeing to provide joint and several guarantees, thus
    allowing the Company to transfer these shares free of any pledge
    or obligation to re-pledge the shares to the lenders. The
    Company subsequently replaced this joint and several guarantee
    in October with letters of credit supporting 56.25% of the
    obligations under the PTNNT project financing facility. On
    July 14, 2009, the Company reached agreement with the
    Indonesian government on the



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

price of the 2008 7% interest and the 2009 7% interest. PTNNT
    has reoffered the 2008 7% interest and the 2009 7% interest to
    the Indonesian government at this newly agreed price. In
    November and December 2009, sale agreements were concluded
    pursuant to which the 2006, 2007 and 2008 shares were
    transferred to PTMDB and 2009 shares were committed to be
    transferred to PTMDB. Although the Indonesian Government has
    acknowledged that PTNNT is no longer in breach of the Contract
    of Work, future disputes may arise as to the further divestiture
    of the shares. It is uncertain who will acquire any future
    divestiture shares, and the nature of our relations with the new
    owners of the

2006-2009 shares

and any future divestiture shares remain uncertain.

As part of the negotiation of the sale agreements with PTMDB,
    the parties executed an operating agreement under which each
    recognizes the right of NTP to operate Batu Hijau and binds the
    parties to adhere to NTP’s standards for safety,
    environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The
    operating agreement becomes effective upon the completion of the
    sale of the 2009 shares and continues for so long as the
    Company owns more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the operating
    agreement terminates, then the Company may lose effective
    economic control over the operations of Batu Hijau and will be
    at risk for operations conducted in a manner that either
    detracts from value or results in safety, environmental or
    social standards below those adhered to by NTP. Although any
    dispute under the Contract of Work is subject to international
    arbitration, there can be no assurance that we would prevail in
    any such dispute and any termination of the Contract of Work
    could result in substantial diminution in the value of our
    interests in PTNNT.

Other
    Commitments and Contingencies

Tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with ASC income
    tax guidance (see Note 8).

In a 1993 asset exchange, a wholly-owned subsidiary transferred
    a coal lease under which the subsidiary had collected advance
    royalty payments totaling $484. From 1994 to 2018, remaining
    advance payments under the lease to the transferee total $390.
    In the event of title failure as stated in the lease, this
    subsidiary has a primary obligation to refund previously
    collected payments and has a secondary obligation to refund any
    of the $390 collected by the transferee, if the transferee fails
    to meet its refund obligation. The subsidiary has title
    insurance on the leased coal deposits of $240 covering the
    secondary obligation. The Company and the subsidiary regard the
    circumstances entitling the lessee to a refund as remote.

The Company has minimum royalty obligations on one of its
    producing mines in Nevada for the life of the mine. Amounts paid
    as a minimum royalty (where production royalties are less than
    the minimum obligation) in any year are recoverable in future
    years when the minimum royalty obligation is exceeded. Although
    the minimum royalty requirement may not be met in a particular
    year, the Company expects that over the mine life, gold
    production will be sufficient to meet the minimum royalty
    requirements. Minimum royalty payments payable are $23 per year
    in 2010 through 2014 and $116 thereafter.

As part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company and
    its affiliates are required to provide surety bonds, bank
    letters of credit and bank guarantees as financial support for
    various purposes, including environmental reclamation,
    exploration permitting, workers compensation programs and other
    general corporate purposes. At December 31 2009 and 2008, there
    were $1,073 and $778, respectively, of outstanding letters of
    credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees. The surety bonds,
    letters of credit and bank guarantees reflect fair value as a
    condition of their underlying purpose and are subject to fees
    competitively determined in the market place. The obligations
    associated with these instruments are generally related to
    performance requirements that the Company addresses through its
    ongoing operations. As the specific requirements are met, the
    beneficiary of the associated instrument cancels

and/or

returns the instrument to the issuing entity.



NEWMONT MINING
    CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Certain of these instruments are associated with operating sites
    with long-lived assets and will remain outstanding until
    closure. Generally, bonding requirements associated with
    environmental regulation are becoming more restrictive. In
    addition, the surety markets for certain types of environmental
    bonding used by the Company have become increasingly
    constrained. The Company, however, believes it is in compliance
    with all applicable bonding obligations and will be able to
    satisfy future bonding requirements, through existing or
    alternative means, as they arise.

Newmont is from time to time involved in various legal
    proceedings related to its business. Except in the
    above-described proceedings, management does not believe that
    adverse decisions in any pending or threatened proceeding or
    that amounts that may be required to be paid by reason thereof
    will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

During the fiscal period covered by this report, the
    Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company,
    carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”)). Based on such evaluation, the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered
    by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits
    under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the required time periods and are designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports
    is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.

There has been no change in the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter
    that has materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

Management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting and the attestation report on management’s
    assessment are included in Item 8 of this annual report on
