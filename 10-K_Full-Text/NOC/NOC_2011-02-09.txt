HISTORY
    AND ORGANIZATION

History

Northrop Grumman Corporation (herein referred to as
    “Northrop Grumman”, the “company”,
    “we”, “us”, or “our”) is an
    integrated enterprise consisting of businesses that address the
    global security spectrum, from undersea to outer space and into
    cyberspace. The companies that are part of today’s Northrop
    Grumman have achieved historic accomplishments, from
    transporting Charles Lindbergh across the Atlantic to carrying
    astronauts to the moon’s surface and back.

The company was originally formed as Northrop Corporation in
    California in 1939 and was reincorporated in Delaware in 1985.
    From 1994 through 2002, we entered a period of significant
    expansion through acquisitions of other businesses, most notably:

n

In 1994, Northrop Corporation acquired Grumman Corporation
    (Grumman) and was renamed Northrop Grumman Corporation. Grumman
    was a premier military aircraft systems integrator and builder
    of the Lunar Module that first delivered men to the surface of
    the moon.

n

In 1996, we acquired the defense and electronics businesses of
    Westinghouse Electric Corporation, a world leader in the
    development and production of sophisticated radar and other
    electronic systems for the nation’s defense, civil
    aviation, and other international and domestic applications.

n

In 2001, we acquired Litton Industries (Litton), a global
    electronics and information technology enterprise, and one of
    the nation’s leading full-service design, engineering,
    construction, and life cycle supporters of major surface ships
    for the United States (U.S.) Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and
    international navies.

n

Also in 2001, we acquired Newport News Shipbuilding (Newport
    News). Newport News is the nation’s sole designer, builder
    and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and one of
    only two companies designing and building nuclear-powered
    submarines.

n

In 2002, we acquired TRW Inc. (TRW), a leading developer of
    military and civil space systems and satellite payloads, as well
    as a leading global integrator of complex, mission-enabling
    systems and services.

Since 2002, other notable acquisitions include Integic
    Corporation (2005), an information technology provider
    specializing in enterprise health and business process
    management solutions and Essex Corporation (2007), a signal
    processing product and services provider to
    U.S. intelligence and defense customers. In addition, we
    divested our Advisory Services Division, TASC, Inc., in 2009.
    See Business Acquisitions and Business Dispositions in
    Part II. Item 7.

These and other transactions have shaped us into our present
    position as a premier provider of technologically advanced,
    innovative products, services and solutions in aerospace,
    electronics, information and services and shipbuilding. As prime
    contractor, principal subcontractor, partner, or preferred
    supplier, we participate in many high-priority defense and
    commercial technology programs in the U.S. and abroad. We
    conduct most of our business with the U.S. Government,
    principally the Department of Defense (DoD). We also conduct
    business with local, state, and foreign governments, and
    domestic and international commercial customers. For a
    discussion of risks associated with our DoD and foreign
    operations, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

Organization

From time to time, we acquire or dispose of businesses, and
    realign contracts, programs or business areas among and within
    our operating segments that possess similar customers,
    expertise, and capabilities. Internal realignments are designed
    to more fully leverage existing capabilities and enhance
    development and delivery of products and services. The operating
    results for all periods presented have been revised to reflect
    these changes made through December 31, 2010.

-1-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

As of December 31, 2010, we are aligned into five operating
    segments: Aerospace Systems, Electronic Systems, Information
    Systems, Shipbuilding, and Technical Services. See Note 8
    to our consolidated financial statements in Part II,
    Item 8.

Strategic
    Actions

In July 2010, we announced that we would evaluate whether a
    separation of the Shipbuilding segment would be in the best
    interests of shareholders, customers, and employees by allowing
    both the company and Shipbuilding to more effectively pursue
    their respective opportunities to maximize long-term value. As
    of December 31, 2010, management anticipates that a
    spin-off of the Shipbuilding segment to our shareholders will
    likely occur in 2011. Since any final decision remains subject
    to approval by our Board of Directors, Shipbuilding’s
    financial results are reported in continuing operations. See
    Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8.

Aircraft Carriers –

Shipbuilding is the
    nation’s sole industrial designer, builder, and refueler of
    nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The U.S. Navy’s
    newest carrier and the last of the

Nimitz

-class, the USS

George H. W. Bush

, was delivered in May 2009. Design work
    on the next generation carrier, the

Ford-

class has been
    underway for over eight years. The

Ford-

class
    incorporates transformational technologies including an enhanced
    flight deck with increased sortie rates, improved weapons
    movement, a redesigned island, a new nuclear power plant design,
    flexibility to incorporate future technologies, and reduced
    manning. In 2008, Shipbuilding was awarded a $5.1 billion
    contract for construction of the first ship of the class, the

Gerald R. Ford

, which is scheduled for delivery in 2015.
    The segment also provides ongoing maintenance for the
    U.S. Navy aircraft carrier fleet through overhaul,
    refueling, and repair work. In 2009, the completion of the
    refueling and complex overhaul of the USS

Carl Vinson

was

    submarines was awarded in August 2003 and the first two
    submarines under this contract were delivered in 2008 and 2009.
    Construction on the remaining four submarines is underway, with
    the last scheduled to be delivered in 2014. In December 2008,
    the construction contract for the third block of eight

Virginia-

class submarines was awarded. The multi-year
    contract allowed Shipbuilding and its teammate to proceed with
    the construction of one submarine per year in 2009 and 2010, and
    allows for the construction of two submarines per year from 2011
    to 2013. The eighth submarine to be procured under this contract
    is scheduled for delivery in 2019.

Shipbuilding is a joint venture partner along with Lockheed
    Martin for the Coast Guard’s Deepwater Modernization
    Program. Shipbuilding has design and production responsibility
    for surface ships. In 2006, the Shipbuilding/Lockheed Martin
    joint venture was awarded a

43-month

contract extension for the Deepwater program. The first National
    Security Cutter (NSC), USCGC

Berthoff

, was delivered to
    the Coast Guard in 2008 followed by the USCGC

Waesche

(NSC-2) in 2009. The

Stratton

(NSC-3) is currently in
    construction. The construction contract for NSC-4 was awarded in
    November 2010.

CUSTOMERS
    AND REVENUE CONCENTRATION

Our primary customer is the U.S. Government. Revenue from
    the U.S. Government (which includes Foreign Military Sales)
    accounted for approximately 92 percent of total revenues in
    2010, 2009, and 2008. No single product or service accounted for
    more than ten percent of total revenue during any period
    presented. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

Patents developed while under contract with the
    U.S. Government may be subject to use by the
    U.S. Government. We license intellectual property to, and
    from, third parties. We believe our ability to conduct
    operations would not be materially affected by the loss of any
    particular intellectual property right. See Risk Factors in
    Part I, Item 1A.

SEASONALITY

No material portion of our business is considered to be
    seasonal. Our revenue recognition timing is based on several
    factors, including the timing of contract awards, the incurrence
    of contract costs, cost estimation, and unit deliveries. See
    Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and
    Judgments – Revenue Recognition in Part II,
    Item 7.

BACKLOG

At December 31, 2010, total backlog was $64.2 billion
    compared with $69.2 billion at the end of 2009.
    Approximately 47 percent of backlog at December 31,
    2010, is expected to be converted into sales in 2011.

Total backlog includes both funded backlog (firm orders for
    which funding is contractually obligated by the customer) and
    unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding is not currently
    contractually obligated by the customer). Unfunded backlog
    excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite
    delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) orders. For multi-year
    services contracts with non-federal government customers having
    no stated contract values, backlog includes only the amounts
    committed by the customer. Backlog is converted into sales as
    work is performed or deliveries are made. For backlog by segment
    see Backlog in Part II, Item 7.

RAW
    MATERIALS

The most significant raw material we require is steel, used
    primarily for shipbuilding. We have mitigated some supply risk
    by negotiating long-term agreements with a number of steel
    suppliers. In addition, we have mitigated price risk related to
    steel purchases through certain contractual arrangements with
    the U.S. Government. While we have generally been able to
    obtain key raw materials required in our production processes in
    a timely manner, a significant delay in supply deliveries could
    have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Risk Factors
    in Part I, Item 1A and Overview – Outlook in
    Part II, Item 7.

GOVERNMENT
    REGULATION

Our businesses are affected by numerous laws and regulations
    relating to the award, administration and performance of
    U.S. Government contracts. See Risk Factors in Part I,
    Item 1A.

The U.S. Government generally has the ability to terminate
    our contracts, in whole or in part, without prior notice, for
    convenience or for default based on performance. If any of our
    U.S. Government contracts were to be terminated for
    convenience, we would generally be protected by provisions
    covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and
    profit on those costs, but not the anticipated profit that would
    have been earned had the contract been completed. In the rare
    circumstance where a U.S. Government contract does not have
    such termination protection, we attempt to mitigate the
    termination risk through other means. Termination resulting from
    our default may expose us to liability and could have a material
    adverse effect on our ability to compete for contracts. See Risk
    Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Certain programs with the U.S. Government that are
    prohibited by the customer from being publicly discussed in
    detail are referred to as “restricted” in this

Form 10-K.

The consolidated financial statements and financial information
    in this

Form 10-K

reflect the operating results of restricted programs under
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (GAAP). See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

RESEARCH
    AND DEVELOPMENT

Our research and development activities primarily include
    independent research and development (IR&D) efforts related
    to government programs. IR&D expenses are included in
    general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated
    to U.S. Government contracts. IR&D expenses totaled
    $603 million, $610 million, and $564 million in
    2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. We charge expenses for
    research and development sponsored by the customer directly to
    the related contracts.

EMPLOYEE
    RELATIONS

We believe that we maintain good relations with our
    117,100 employees, of which approximately 20 percent
    are covered by 32 collective bargaining agreements. We
    negotiated or re-negotiated twelve of our collective bargaining
    agreements in 2010. These negotiations had no material adverse
    effect on our results of operations. For risks associated with
    collective bargaining agreements, see Risk Factors in
    Part I, Item 1A.

ENVIRONMENTAL
    MATTERS

Our manufacturing operations are subject to and affected by
    federal, state, foreign, and local laws and regulations relating
    to the protection of the environment. We provide for the
    estimated cost to complete environmental remediation where we
    determine it is probable that we will incur such costs in the
    future to address environmental impacts at currently or formerly
    owned or leased operating facilities, or at sites where we are
    named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similarly
    designated by other environmental agencies. These estimates may
    change given the inherent difficulty in estimating environmental
    cleanup costs to be incurred in the future due to the
    uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup,
    determination of legally responsible parties, and the status of
    laws, regulations, and their interpretations.

We assess the potential impact on our financial statements by
    estimating the possible remediation costs that we could
    reasonably incur on a

site-by-site

basis. These estimates consider our environmental
    engineers’ professional judgment and, when necessary, we
    consult with outside environmental specialists. In most
    instances, we can only estimate a range of reasonably possible
    costs. We accrue our best estimate when determinable or the
    minimum amount when no single amount is more probable. We record
    accruals for environmental cleanup costs in the accounting
    period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability
    and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We record insurance
    recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable.
    Our environmental remediation accruals do not include any
    litigation costs related to environmental matters, nor do they
    include any amounts recorded as asset retirement obligations.

We estimate that at December 31, 2010, the range of
    reasonably possible future costs for environmental remediation
    sites is $280 million to $674 million, of which we
    accrued $109 million in other current liabilities and
    $207 million in other long-term liabilities in the
    consolidated statements of financial position. We record
    environmental accruals on an undiscounted basis. At sites
    involving multiple parties, we provide environmental accruals
    based upon our expected share of liability, taking into account
    the financial viability of other jointly liable parties. We
    expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate.
    Capitalized expenditures relate to long-lived improvements in
    currently operating facilities. We may have to incur costs in
    addition to those already estimated and accrued if other PRPs do
    not pay their allocable share of remediation costs, which could
    have a material effect on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows. We have made the
    investments we believe necessary to comply with environmental
    laws.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

We could be affected by future laws or regulations, including
    those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other
    actions known as “green initiatives.” We established a
    goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions over a five-year
    period through December 31, 2014. To comply with existing
    green initiatives and our greenhouse gas emissions goal, we
    expect to incur capital and operating costs, but at this time we
    do not expect that such costs will have a material adverse
    effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

COMPETITIVE
    CONDITIONS

We compete with many companies in the U.S. defense industry
    and the information and services markets for a number of
    programs, both large and small. In the U.S. defense
    industry, Lockheed Martin Corporation, The Boeing Company,
    Raytheon Company, General Dynamics Corporation, L-3
    Communications Corporation, SAIC, and BAE Systems Inc. are our
    primary competitors. Intense competition and long operating
    cycles are both key characteristics of our business and the
    defense industry. It is common in the defense industry for work
    on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A
    company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate
    award of the contract to another competitor, become a
    subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company. It is
    not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company
    and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to or a customer of
    that same competitor on other contracts, or vice versa. The
    nature of major defense programs, conducted under binding
    contracts, allows companies that perform well to benefit from a
    level of program continuity not frequently found in other
    industries.

Our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our
    ability to develop and market our products and services, as well
    as our ability to provide the people, technologies, facilities,
    equipment, and financial capacity needed to deliver those
    products and services affordably and efficiently. Like most of
    our competitors, we are vertically integrated but also have a
    high reliance on the supply chain. We must continue to maintain
    dependable sources for raw materials, fabricated parts,
    electronic components, and major subassemblies. In this
    increasingly complex manufacturing and systems integration
    environment, effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers
    is vital to our success.

Similarly, there is intense competition among many companies in
    the information and services markets, which are generally more
    labor intensive with highly competitive margin rates and
    contract performance periods of shorter duration. Competitors in
    the information and services markets include the defense
    industry participants mentioned above as well as many other
    large and small entities with specialized expertise. Our ability
    to successfully compete in the information and services markets
    depends on a number of factors. The most important factor is the
    ability to deploy skilled professionals, many requiring security
    clearances, at competitive prices across the diverse spectrum of
    these markets. Accordingly, we have implemented various
    workforce initiatives to ensure our success in attracting,
    developing and retaining these skilled professionals in
    sufficient numbers to maintain or improve our competitive
    position within these markets.

In both the U.S. defense industry and information and
    services markets, the federal government has recently indicated
    that it intends to increase industry competition for its future
    procurement of products and services. This may lead to fewer
    sole source awards and more emphasis on cost competitiveness and
    affordability than in the past. In addition, the DoD has
    announced several initiatives to improve efficiency, refocus
    priorities and enhance DoD best practices including those used
    to procure goods and services from defense contractors. See
    Overview in Part II, Item 7, and Risk Factors in
    Part I, Item 1A. These new initiatives, when
    implemented, could result in fewer new opportunities for our
    industry as a whole, and a reduced opportunity set would in turn
    intensify competition within the industry as companies compete
    for a more limited set of new programs.

Item 1A.
    Risk Factors

Our consolidated financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not
    exclusively within our control, that may cause actual
    performance to differ materially from historical or projected
    future performance. We urge you to carefully consider the risk
    factors described below in evaluating the information contained
    in this report.

n

We depend heavily on a single customer, the U.S.
    Government, for a substantial portion of our business, including
    programs subject to security classification restrictions on
    information, and changes affecting this customer’s ability
    to do business with us could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows.

The funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to
    congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes.
    For many programs, Congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year
    basis even though a program may extend over several fiscal
    years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded
    initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress
    makes further appropriations. We cannot predict the extent to
    which total funding

and/or

funding for individual programs will be included, increased or
    reduced as part of the 2011 and subsequent budgets ultimately
    approved by Congress or be included in the scope of separate
    supplemental appropriations. The entire federal government is
    currently funded under a Continuing Resolution until
    March 4, 2011. The impact, severity and duration of the
    current U.S. economic situation, the sweeping economic
    plans adopted by the U.S. Government, and pressures on the
    federal budget could also adversely affect the total funding

and/or

funding for individual programs. In the event that
    appropriations for any of our programs becomes unavailable, or
    is reduced or delayed, our contract or subcontract under such
    program may be terminated or adjusted by the
    U.S. Government, which could have a material adverse effect
    on our future sales under such program, and on our financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in
    priorities due to military transformation and planning

and/or

the
    nature of war-related activity on existing, follow-on or
    replacement programs. A shift of government priorities to
    programs in which we do not participate

and/or

reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in
    which we do participate, unless offset by other programs and
    opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In addition, the U.S. Government generally has the ability
    to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, without prior
    notice, for convenience or for default based on performance. In
    the event of termination for the U.S. Government’s
    convenience, contractors are generally protected by provisions
    covering

-10-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on
    those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been
    earned had the contract been completed. In the rare circumstance
    where a U.S. government contract does not have such
    termination protection, we attempt to mitigate the termination
    risk through other means. To the extent such means are
    unavailable or do not fully address the costs incurred or profit
    on those costs, we could face significant losses from the
    termination for convenience of a contract that lacks termination
    protection. Termination by the U.S. Government of a
    contract for convenience could also result in the cancellation
    of future work on that program. Termination by the
    U.S. Government of a contract due to our default could
    require us to pay for re-procurement costs in excess of the
    original contract price, net of the value of work accepted from
    the original contract. Termination of a contract due to our
    default may expose us to liability and could have a material
    adverse effect on our ability to compete for contracts.

n

As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a
    number of procurement regulations and could be adversely
    affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from
    a U.S. Government audit or investigation.

U.S. Government contractors must comply with many
    significant procurement regulations and other requirements.
    These regulations and requirements, although customary in
    government contracts, increase our performance and compliance
    costs. If any such regulations or procurement requirements
    change, our costs of complying with them could increase and
    reduce our margins.

We operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely
    audited and reviewed by the U.S. Government and its
    agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and
    Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). These agencies review
    our performance under our contracts, our cost structure and our
    compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, as
    well as the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal
    control systems and policies. Systems that are subject to review
    include, but are not limited to, our accounting systems,
    purchasing systems, billing systems, property management and
    control systems, cost estimating systems, compensation systems
    and management information systems. Any costs found to be
    unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will
    not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. If
    an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be
    subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative
    sanctions, which may include termination of contracts,
    forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and
    suspension, or prohibition from doing business with the
    U.S. Government. Whether or not illegal activities are
    alleged, the U.S. Government also has the ability to
    decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems
    subject to its review to be inadequate. In addition, we could
    suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety
    were made against us.

The U.S. Government, from time to time, recommends to its
    contractors that certain contract prices be reduced, or that
    costs allocated to certain contracts be disallowed. These
    recommendations can involve substantial amounts. In the past, as
    a result of such audits and other investigations and inquiries,
    we have on occasion made adjustments to our contract prices and
    the costs allocated to our government contracts.

We are also, from time to time, subject to U.S. Government
    investigations relating to our operations, and we are subject to
    or expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of
    federal laws, including but not limited to the Truth in
    Negotiations Act, the False Claims Act, the Procurement
    Integrity Act, Cost Accounting Standards, the International
    Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export
    Control Act, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act and the
    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If we are convicted or otherwise
    found to have violated the law, or are found not to have acted
    responsibly as defined by the law, we may be subject to
    reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or
    termination and the assessment of penalties and fines,
    compensatory or treble damages, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations,
    or cash flows. Such findings or convictions could also result in
    suspension or debarment from government contracting. Given our
    dependence on

-11-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

government contracting, suspension or debarment could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows.

n

The Department of Defense has announced plans for
    significant changes to its business practices that could have a
    material effect on its overall procurement process and adversely
    impact our current programs and potential new awards.

In September 2010, the DoD announced various initiatives
    designed to gain efficiencies, refocus priorities and enhance
    business practices used by the DoD, including those used to
    procure goods and services from defense contractors. These
    initiatives are organized into five major areas: affordability
    and cost growth; productivity and innovation; competition;
    services acquisition; and processes and bureaucracy. These new
    initiatives are expected to have a significant impact on the
    contracting environment in which we do business with our DoD
    customers and they could have a significant impact on current
    programs as well as new DoD business opportunities. In his
    January 6, 2011, announcement regarding future plans, the
    Secretary of Defense employed some of these initiatives to
    reduce costs and free up resources for reinvestment. For
    example, he discussed using multi-year procurement of Navy
    aircraft, information technology infrastructure streamlining,
    reductions in outsourcing, consolidation of operating centers
    and staffs, improving depot and supply chain processes,
    downsizing intelligence organizations, and eliminating some
    elements of the DoD’s bureaucracy. Changes to the DoD
    acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether
    and, if so, how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms
    under which we are able to do so. These initiatives are still
    fairly new and the full impact to our business remains uncertain
    and subject to the manner in which the DoD implements them.

n

Competition within our markets and an increase in bid
    protests may reduce our revenues and market share.

We operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may
    have more extensive or more specialized engineering,
    manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some
    areas. We anticipate higher competition in some of our core
    markets as a result of the reduction in budgets for many
    U.S. Government agencies and fewer new program starts. In
    addition, as discussed in more detail above, projected
    U.S. defense spending levels for periods beyond the
    near-term are uncertain and difficult to predict. Changes in
    U.S. defense spending may limit certain future market
    opportunities. We are also facing increasing competition in our
    domestic and international markets from foreign and
    multinational firms. Additionally, some customers, including the
    DoD, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional
    defense contractors, for information technology and other
    support work. If we are unable to continue to compete
    successfully against our current or future competitors, we may
    experience declines in revenues and market share which could
    negatively impact our financial position, results of operations,
    or cash flows.

The competitive environment is also affected by bid protests
    from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Bid protests
    could result in the award decision being overturned, requiring a
    re-bid of the contract. Even where a bid protest does not result
    in a re-bid, the resolution typically extends the time until the
    contract activity can begin, which may reduce our earnings in
    the period in which the contract would otherwise have commenced.

n

Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to
    develop new products and new technologies and maintain
    technologies, facilities, equipment and a qualified workforce to
    meet the needs of current and future customers.

The markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly
    changing technologies. The product, program and service needs of
    our customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our
    success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our
    ability to develop and market our products and services, as well
    as our ability to provide the people, technologies, facilities,
    equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those
    products and services with maximum efficiency. If we fail to
    maintain our competitive position, we could lose a significant
    amount of future business to our competitors, which would have a
    material adverse effect on our ability to generate favorable
    financial results and maintain market share.

Operating results are heavily dependent upon our ability to
    attract and retain sufficient personnel with requisite skills

and/or

security clearances. If qualified personnel become scarce, we
    could experience higher

-12-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and
    retain such employees or could experience difficulty in
    performing under our contracts if the needs for such employees
    are unmet.

Approximately 20 percent of our 117,100 employees are
    covered by an aggregate of 32 collective bargaining agreements.
    We expect to re-negotiate renewals of four of our collective
    bargaining agreements in 2011. Collective bargaining agreements
    generally expire after three to five years and are subject to
    renegotiation at that time. We may experience difficulties with
    renewals and renegotiations of existing collective bargaining
    agreements. If we experience such difficulties, we could incur
    additional expenses and work stoppages. Any such expenses or
    delays could adversely affect programs served by employees who
    are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

n

Many of our contracts contain performance obligations that
    require innovative design capabilities, are technologically
    complex, require

state-of-the-art

manufacturing expertise or are dependent upon factors not wholly
    within our control. Failure to meet these obligations could
    adversely affect our profitability and future prospects.

We design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced and
    innovative products and services applied by our customers in a
    variety of environments. Problems and delays in development or
    delivery as a result of issues with respect to design,
    technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve
    assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from
    achieving contractual requirements.

In addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all
    situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems.
    Examples of unforeseen problems that could negatively affect
    revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft,
    premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair
    or replacement, problems with quality and workmanship, country
    of origin, delivery of subcontractor components or services and
    unplanned degradation of product performance. These failures
    could result, either directly or indirectly, in loss of life or
    property. Among the factors that may affect revenue and profits
    could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance
    or indemnification from the customer, diversion of management
    focus in responding to unforeseen problems, loss of follow-on
    work, and, in the case of certain contracts, repayment to the
    government customer of contract cost and fee payments we
    previously received.

Certain contracts, primarily involving space satellite systems,
    contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in
    the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon
    launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period
    of time. Under such terms, we could be required to forfeit fees
    previously recognized

and/or

collected. We have not experienced any material losses in the
    last decade in connection with such contract performance
    incentive provisions. However, if we were to experience launch
    failures or complete satellite system failures in the future,
    such events could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

n

Contract cost growth on fixed-price and other contracts
    that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due
    from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the
    potential loss of future business.

Our operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain
    contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that
    cannot be billed to customers. This cost growth can occur if
    estimates to complete increase due to technical challenges,
    manufacturing difficulties or delays, or workforce-related
    issues, or if initial estimates used for calculating the
    contract cost were incorrect. The cost estimation process
    requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost
    growth may include unavailability or reduced productivity of
    labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed,
    the timelines and availability of materials, major subcontractor
    performance and quality of their products, the effect of any
    delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from
    the customer, natural disasters and the inability to recover any
    claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant
    change in cost estimates on one or

-13-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

more programs could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Most of our contracts are firm fixed-price contracts or flexibly
    priced contracts. Our risk varies with the type of contract.
    Flexibly priced contracts include both cost-type and fixed-price
    incentive contracts. Due to their nature, firm fixed-price
    contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced
    contracts. Approximately 33 percent of our annual revenues
    are derived from firm fixed-price contracts – see
    Contracts in Part II, Item 7. We typically enter into
    firm fixed-price contracts where costs can be reasonably
    estimated based on experience. In addition, our contracts
    contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights.
    Should the terms specified in our contracts not be met, then
    profitability may be reduced. Fixed-price development work
    comprises a small portion of our firm fixed-price contracts and
    inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than
    production contracts and therefore more variability in estimates
    of the costs to complete the development stage. As work
    progresses through the development stage into production, the
    risks associated with estimating the total costs of the contract
    are generally reduced. In addition, successful performance of
    firm fixed-price development contracts that include production
    units is subject to our ability to control cost growth in
    meeting production specifications and delivery rates. While
    management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated
    with fixed-price development contracts, future events could
    result in either upward or downward adjustments to those
    estimates.

Under a fixed-price incentive contract, the allowable costs
    incurred by the contractor are subject to reimbursement, but are
    subject to a cost-share limit which affects profitability.
    Contracts in Shipbuilding are often fixed-price incentive
    contracts for production of a first item without a separate
    development contract. Accordingly, we face the additional
    difficulty of estimating production costs on a product that has
    not yet been designed. Further, Shipbuilding sometimes enters
    into follow-on fixed-price contracts after a significant delay
    from the first production request, and the passage of time makes
    it more difficult for us to accurately estimate costs for
    renewed production.

Under a cost-type contract the allowable costs incurred by the
    contractor are also subject to reimbursement plus a fee that
    represents profit. We enter into cost-type contracts for
    development programs with complex design and technical
    challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or
    incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned
    over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial
    risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program
    cancellation if cost, schedule, or technical performance issues
    arise.

n

Our earnings and margins depend, in part, on our ability
    to perform under contracts.

When agreeing to contractual terms, our management makes
    assumptions and projections about future conditions and events,
    many of which extend over long periods. These projections assess
    the productivity and availability of labor, the complexity of
    the work to be performed, the cost and availability of
    materials, the impact of delayed performance, and the timing of
    product deliveries. If there is a significant change in one or
    more of these circumstances or estimates, or if we face
    unanticipated contract costs, the profitability of one or more
    of these contracts may be adversely affected.

n

Our earnings and margins depend, in part, on subcontractor
    performance as well as raw material and component availability
    and pricing.

We rely on other companies to provide raw materials and major
    components for our products and rely on subcontractors to
    produce hardware elements and

sub-assemblies

and perform some of the services that we provide to our
    customers. Disruptions or performance problems caused by our
    subcontractors and vendors could have an adverse effect on our
    ability to meet our commitments to customers. Our ability to
    perform our obligations as a prime contractor could be adversely
    affected if one or more of the vendors or subcontractors are
    unable to provide the

agreed-upon

products or materials or perform the

agreed-upon

services in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Our costs may increase over the term of our contracts. Through
    cost escalation provisions contained in some of our
    U.S. Government contracts, we may be protected from
    increases in material costs to the extent that the increases in
    our costs are in line with industry indices. However, the
    difference in basis between our actual material costs and these
    indices may expose us to cost uncertainty even with these
    provisions. A significant delay in supply deliveries of our key
    raw materials required in our production processes could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows.

In connection with our government contracts, we are required to
    procure certain materials, components and parts from supply
    sources approved by the U.S. Government. There are
    currently several components for which there may be only one
    supplier. The inability of a sole source supplier to meet our
    needs could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

n

Our business is subject to disruption caused by natural
    disasters, environmental disasters and other factors that could
    adversely affect our profitability and our overall financial
    position.

We have significant operations located in regions of the
    U.S. that may be exposed to damaging storms and other
    natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes, and
    environmental disasters, such as oil spills. Although
    preventative measures may help to mitigate damage, the damage
    and disruption resulting from natural and environmental
    disasters may be significant. Should insurance or other risk
    transfer mechanisms be unavailable or insufficient to recover
    all costs, we could experience a material adverse effect on our
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural
    disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform
    under a contract. Performance failures by our subcontractors due
    to natural and environmental disasters may adversely affect our
    ability to perform our obligations on the prime contract, which
    could reduce our profitability due to damages or other costs
    that may not be fully recoverable from the subcontractor or from
    the customer and could result in a termination of the prime
    contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete
    for future contracts.

Natural disasters can also disrupt our workforce, electrical and
    other power distribution networks, including computer and
    internet operation and accessibility, and the critical
    industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations.
    These disruptions could cause adverse effects on our
    profitability and performance. Environmental disasters,
    particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water used
    for the transport and testing of our ships, can disrupt the
    timing of our performance under our contracts with the
    U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard.

n

We use estimates when accounting for contracts. Changes in
    estimates could affect our profitability and our overall
    financial position.

Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing
    risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making
    assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size
    and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total
    revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to
    many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made
    regarding the length of time to complete the contract because
    costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for
    materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the
    future impact of our self-imposed efficiency initiatives and
    cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards or penalties related
    to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue
    and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient
    information to assess anticipated performance.

Because of the significance of the judgment and estimation
    processes described above, it is possible that materially
    different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions
    were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change.
    Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates
    may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial
    reporting and performance. See Critical Accounting Policies,
    Estimates, and Judgments in Part II, Item 7.

Our international business exposes us to additional
    risks.

Although our international business constitutes only
    5 percent of total revenues, we are subject to numerous
    U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without
    limitation, regulations relating to import-export control,
    technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings,
    exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the
    anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration
    Act. Failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants
    to comply with these laws and regulations could result in
    administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the
    extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government
    contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could
    have a material adverse effect on us. Changes in regulation or
    political environment may affect our ability to conduct business
    in foreign markets, including investment, procurement and
    repatriation of earnings.

The services and products we provide internationally, including
    through the use of subcontractors, are sometimes in countries
    with unstable governments, in areas of military conflict or at
    military installations. This increases the risk of an incident
    resulting in damage or destruction to our products or resulting
    in injury or loss of life to our employees, subcontractors or
    other third parties. We maintain insurance to mitigate risk and
    potential liabilities related to our international operations,
    but our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover these
    claims and liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial
    costs arising from those claims. (See additional discussion of
    possible inadequacy of our insurance coverage below). In
    addition, any accidents or incidents that occur in connection
    with our international operations could result in negative
    publicity for the company, which may adversely affect our
    reputation and make it more difficult for us to compete for
    future contracts or result in the loss of existing and future
    contracts. The impact of these factors is difficult to predict,
    but any one or more of them could adversely affect our financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

n

Our reputation and our ability to do business may be
    impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents or
    business partners.

We have implemented extensive compliance controls, policies and
    procedures to prevent and detect reckless or criminal acts
    committed by employees, agents or business partners that would
    violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate,
    including laws governing payments to government officials,
    security clearance breaches, cost accounting and billing,
    competition and data privacy. However, we cannot ensure that we
    will prevent all such reckless or criminal acts committed by our
    employees, agents or business partners. Any improper actions
    could subject us to civil or criminal investigations and
    monetary and non-monetary penalties and could have a material
    adverse effect on our ability to conduct business, our results
    of operations and our reputation.

n

Our business could be negatively impacted by security
    threats and other disruptions.

As a defense contractor, we face certain security threats,
    including threats to our information technology infrastructure
    and unlawful attempts to gain access to our proprietary or
    classified information. Our information technology networks and
    related systems are critical to the smooth operation of our
    business and essential to our ability to perform

day-to-day

operations. Loss of security within this critical operational
    infrastructure could disrupt our operations, require significant
    management attention and resources and could have a material
    adverse effect on our performance.

We also manage information technology systems for various
    customers. While we maintain information security policies and
    procedures for managing these systems, we generally face the
    same security threats for these systems as for our own systems.
    Computer viruses, attempts to gain access to our customers’
    data or other electronic security breaches could lead to
    disruptions in mission critical systems for our customers,
    unauthorized release of confidential or personally identifiable
    information and corruption of customer data.

These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial
    losses from remedial actions we must take, potential liability
    to customers and litigation expenses.

n

Our nuclear operations subject us to various
    environmental, regulatory, financial and other risks.

The development and operation of nuclear-powered aircraft
    carriers, nuclear-powered submarines, nuclear facilities and
    other nuclear operations subject us to various risks, including:

n

potential liabilities relating to harmful effects on the
    environment and human health resulting from nuclear operations
    and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;

n

unplanned expenditures relating to maintenance, operation,
    security and repair, including repairs required by the Nuclear
    Regulatory Commission;

n

reputational harm; and

n

potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident whether
    or not it is within our control.

The U.S. Government provides indemnity protection against
    specified risks under our contracts pursuant to Public Law

85-804

and
    the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act for certain
    of our nuclear operations risks. Our nuclear operations are
    subject to various safety-related requirements imposed by the
    U.S. Navy, DoE, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In the
    event of noncompliance, these agencies may increase regulatory
    oversight, impose fines or shut down our operations, depending
    upon the assessment of the severity of the situation. Revised
    security and safety requirements promulgated by these agencies
    could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures.
    Additionally, while we maintain insurance for certain risks
    related to transportation of low level nuclear materials and
    waste, such as contaminated clothing, and for regulatory changes
    in the health, safety and fire protection areas, there can be no
    assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our
    costs in the event of an accident or business interruption
    relating to our nuclear operations, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations,
    or cash flows.

n

Unforeseen environmental costs could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations,
    or cash flows.

Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of
    federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws
    and regulations. In addition, we could be affected by future
    laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to
    climate change concerns and other actions commonly referred to
    as “green initiatives.” Compliance with current and
    future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and
    is expected to continue to require significant operating and
    capital costs.

Environmental laws and regulations can impose substantial fines
    and criminal sanctions for violations, and may require the
    installation of costly pollution control equipment or
    operational changes to limit pollution emissions or discharges

and/or

decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance
    releases. We also incur, and expect to continue to incur, costs
    to comply with current federal and state environmental laws and
    regulations related to the cleanup of pollutants previously
    released into the environment. In addition, if we were found to
    be in violation of the Federal Clean Air Act or the Clean Water
    Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could
    be placed by the EPA on the “Excluded Parties List”
    maintained by the General Services Administration. The listing
    would continue until the EPA concludes that the cause of the
    violation had been cured. Listed facilities cannot be used in
    performing any U.S. Government contract while they are
    listed by the EPA.

The adoption of new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement
    of existing laws and regulations, imposition of new cleanup
    requirements, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive
    contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, our
    ability to recover such costs under previously priced contracts
    or

-17-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us
    to incur costs in the future that would have a material adverse
    effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows.

n

We are subject to various claims and litigation that could
    ultimately be resolved against us. Resolution of these matters
    may require material future cash payments and/or future material
    charges against our operating income.

The size, type and complexity of our business make us highly
    susceptible to claims and litigation. We are and may become
    subject to various environmental claims, income tax matters and
    other litigation, which, if not resolved within established
    reserves, could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows. See Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3,
    Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments in
    Part II, Item 7 and Note 15 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8. Any claims
    and litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could
    negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the
    public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively
    or obtain adequate insurance in the future.

n

We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual
    property rights, which could affect our ability to
    compete.

We own many U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks,
    copyrights, and other forms of intellectual property. The
    U.S. Government has rights to use certain intellectual
    property that we develop in performance of government contracts,
    and it may use or authorize others to use such intellectual
    property. Our intellectual property is subject to challenge,
    invalidation, misappropriation or circumvention by third parties.

We also rely significantly upon proprietary technology,
    information, processes and know-how that are not protected by
    patents. We seek to protect this information through trade
    secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees,
    consultants, subcontractors and other parties, as well as
    through other security measures. These agreements and security
    measures may not provide meaningful protection for our
    unpatented proprietary information. In the event of an
    infringement of our intellectual property rights, a breach of a
    confidentiality agreement or divulgence of proprietary
    information, we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain
    our intellectual property. Litigation to determine the scope of
    intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful,
    could be costly and could divert management’s attention
    away from other aspects of our business. In addition, our trade
    secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed
    by competitors.

In some instances, we have licensed the proprietary intellectual
    property of others, but we may be unable in the future to secure
    the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property on
    commercially reasonable terms.

n

Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of
    our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of
    material losses we incur, which could adversely affect our
    profitability and overall financial position.

We endeavor to identify and obtain in established markets
    insurance agreements to cover significant risks and liabilities
    (including, for example, natural disasters and product
    liability). Not every risk or liability can be protected by
    insurance, and, for insurable risks, the limits of coverage
    reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to
    cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred, including for
    example, a catastrophic earthquake claim. In some, but not all,
    circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the
    U.S. Government. Because of the limitations in overall
    available coverage referred to above, we may have to bear
    substantial costs for uninsured losses that could have an
    adverse effect upon our financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows. Additionally, disputes with insurance
    carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and,
    if litigation with the carrier becomes necessary, an outcome
    unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We
    commenced legal action against an insurance carrier arising out
    of a disagreement concerning the coverage of certain losses
    related to Hurricane Katrina, and another carrier has denied
    coverage for certain other losses related to

-18-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Hurricane Katrina and advised us that it will seek reimbursement
    of certain amounts previously advanced by that carrier. See
    Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8.

n

Changes in future business conditions could cause business
    investments and/or recorded goodwill to become impaired,
    resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would
    reduce our operating income.

As part of our overall strategy, we may, from time to time,
    acquire a minority or majority interest in a business. These
    investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence
    procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic
    objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions
    and judgment in determining acquisition price. Even after
    careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary
    significantly from initial estimates. Goodwill accounts for
    approximately half of our recorded total assets. We evaluate
    goodwill amounts for impairment annually, or when evidence of
    potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based
    on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a
    significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market
    conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded
    goodwill. Adverse equity market conditions that result in a
    decline in market multiples and our stock price could result in
    an impairment of goodwill

and/or

other
    intangible assets. We continue to monitor the recoverability of
    the carrying value of our goodwill and other long-lived assets.
    See Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments in
    Part II, Item 7.

n

Anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint
    ventures or strategic alliances may not be realized.

As part of our overall strategy, we may, from time to time,
    merge with or acquire businesses, or form joint ventures or
    create strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated
    benefits from these transactions depends, in part, upon the
    integration between the businesses involved, the performance of
    the underlying products, capabilities or technologies and the
    management of the transacted operations. Accordingly, our
    financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated
    performance issues, transaction-related charges, amortization of
    expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of
    long-term assets and partner performance. Although we believe
    that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and
    processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that
    these transactions will be successful.

n

We are exploring strategic alternatives for our
    Shipbuilding segment. We cannot assure you that a transaction
    will result, or that, if completed, we would realize the
    anticipated benefits thereof.

In July 2010, we announced that we are evaluating strategic
    alternatives for the Shipbuilding segment, including, but not
    limited to, a spin-off to our shareholders. In preparation for
    an anticipated spin-off of the Shipbuilding business to our
    shareholders, a registration statement on Form 10 for the
    shares of our wholly owned subsidiary, Huntington Ingalls
    Industries, Inc., the entity that would hold the shipbuilding
    business, was initially filed with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission in October 2010, with amendments filed in November
    2010, December 2010, and January 2011. We cannot assure you that
    the exploration of these strategic alternatives will result in
    any transaction. Our ability to complete a transaction involving
    the Shipbuilding segment in a timely manner, or even at all,
    could be subject to several factors, including: changes in the
    company’s operating performance; our ability to obtain any
    necessary consents or approvals; changes in governmental
    regulations and policies; and changes in business, political and
    economic conditions in the United States. As a condition of an
    anticipated spin-off, we have obtained a private letter ruling
    from the Internal Revenue Service and expect to receive an
    opinion of counsel that the spin-off will be tax-free to the
    company and our shareholders but can give no assurance that any
    anticipated spin-off will ultimately qualify as a tax-free
    transaction. If a transaction involving the Shipbuilding segment
    is delayed for any reason, we may not realize the anticipated
    benefits, and if a transaction does not occur, we will not
    realize such benefits. Each of these risks could adversely
    affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows.

Market volatility and adverse capital and credit market
    conditions may affect our ability to access cost-effective
    sources of funding and expose us to risks associated with the
    financial viability of suppliers and the ability of
    counterparties to perform on financial instruments.

The financial and credit markets recently experienced high
    levels of volatility and disruption, reducing the availability
    of credit for certain issuers. Historically, we have
    occasionally accessed these markets to support certain business
    activities, including acquisitions, capital expansion projects,
    refinancing existing debt and issuing letters of credit. In the
    future, we may not be able to obtain capital market financing or
    bank financing when needed on favorable terms, or at all, which
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows.

A tightening of credit could also adversely affect our
    suppliers’ ability to obtain financing. Delays in
    suppliers’ ability to obtain financing, or the
    unavailability of financing, could cause us to be unable to meet
    our contract obligations and could adversely affect our
    financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The
    inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could also result
    in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers, which
    could result in significant incremental cost and delay.

We have executed transactions with counterparties in the
    financial services industry, including brokers and dealers,
    commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional
    parties. These transactions expose us to potential credit risk
    in the event of counterparty default.

Pension and medical expenses associated with our
    retirement benefit plans may fluctuate significantly depending
    upon changes in actuarial assumptions, future market performance
    of plan assets, future trends in health care costs and
    legislative or other regulatory actions.

A substantial portion of our current and retired employee
    population is covered by pension and post-retirement benefit
    plans, the costs of which are dependent upon our various
    assumptions, including estimates of rates of return on benefit
    related assets, discount rates for future payment obligations,
    rates of future cost growth and trends for future costs. In
    addition, funding requirements for benefit obligations of our
    pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to
    legislative and other government regulatory actions.

Variances from these estimates could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows. For example, the recent volatility in the financial
    markets resulted in lower than expected returns on our pension
    plan assets in 2008, which resulted in higher pension costs in
    subsequent years. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8.

Additionally, due to government regulations, pension plan cost
    recoveries under our government contracts may occur in different
    periods from when those pension costs are accrued for financial
    statement purposes or when pension funding is made. Timing
    differences between pension costs accrued for financial
    statement purposes or when pension funding occurs compared to
    when such costs are recoverable as allowable costs under our
    government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our
    cash flow from operations. In May 2010, the U.S. Cost
    Accounting Standards Board published a proposed rulemaking that,
    if adopted, could provide a framework to partially harmonize
    these funding timing differences. See Overview –
    Industry Factors, Recent Developments in U.S. Cost
    Accounting Standards (CAS) Pension Recovery Rules in
    Part II, Item 7 for further discussion.

Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to
    additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability
    and cash flow.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign
    jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining
    our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course
    of business, there are many transactions and calculations where
    the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, timing
    differences in the recognition of income from contracts for
    financial statement purposes and for income tax regulations can
    cause uncertainty with respect to the timing of income tax
    payments which can have a

-20-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

significant impact on cash flow in a particular period.
    Furthermore, changes in applicable domestic or foreign income
    tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result
    in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the
    taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain
    expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and
    profitability. The final determination of any tax audits or
    related litigation could be materially different from our
    historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally,
    changes in our tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of
    earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,
    changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax
    legislation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and
    liabilities, changes in differences between financial reporting
    income and taxable income, the results of audits and the
    examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing
    authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures
    could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax
    expense, profitability and cash flow.

We maintain our properties in good operating condition. We
    believe that the productive capacity of our properties is
    adequate to meet current contractual requirements and those for
    the foreseeable future.

In January 2010, we announced our decision to move our principal
    executive offices from Los Angeles, California to the Washington
    D.C. area. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we purchased an
    existing 334,407 square foot building located at 2980
    Fairview Park Drive, Falls Church, Virginia, as the new location
    for our principal executive offices and expect to initiate
    operations there in the summer of 2011. We believe this move
    will enable us to better serve our customers. Although we are
    moving some corporate staff from Los Angeles, the state of
    California remains a significant business location for us.

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated
    as net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures and
    outsourcing contract and related software costs. Outsourcing
    contract and related software costs are similar to capital
    expenditures in that the contract costs represent incremental
    external costs or certain specific internal costs that are
    directly related to the contract acquisition and
    transition/set-up. These outsourcing contract and related
    software costs are deferred and expensed over the contract life.
    See Liquidity and Capital Resources – Free Cash Flow
    in Part II, Item 7 for more information on this
    measure.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

OVERVIEW

Business

We provide technologically advanced, innovative products,
    services, and integrated solutions in aerospace, electronics,
    information and services and shipbuilding to our global
    customers. We participate in many high-priority defense and
    commercial technology programs in the United States (U.S.) and
    abroad as a prime contractor, principal subcontractor, partner,
    or preferred supplier. We conduct most of our business with the
    U.S. Government, principally the Department of Defense
    (DoD). We also conduct business with local, state, and foreign
    governments and domestic and international commercial customers.

Outlook

Beginning with the credit crisis of 2008 through the present,
    the United States and global economies have experienced a period
    of substantial economic uncertainty and turmoil, and the related
    financial markets have been characterized by significant
    volatility. While the financial markets have begun to stabilize
    and improve in 2009 and 2010, the U.S. and global economies
    continue to struggle as a result of high levels of national debt
    and historic levels of borrowing to support stimulus and
    financial support spending.

Current levels of deficit spending are at high levels and likely
    are unsustainable for the U.S. and several of its allies,
    and we expect that U.S. and allied government defense
    spending may come under increasing pressure as governments
    search for ways to reduce deficits and national debts. Defense
    Secretary Gates recently proposed a baseline fiscal 2012 defense
    budget of $553 billion, which is $6 billion higher
    than the fiscal 2011 budget request, but $13 billion less
    than previously planned. Under this budget proposal, the overall
    defense budget will decline by $78 billion over a five year
    period beginning in fiscal 2012 from the previous plan, and will
    include program cancellations and restructurings, including
    reducing the number of F-35 joint strike fighters from 449 to
    325 jets

-28-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

over that period. Northrop Grumman is one of the largest
    subcontractors on the F-35 program, and if approved by Congress,
    the reduction would impact our revenues.

Secretary Gates also outlined future opportunities for which we
    could compete, including a next generation nuclear capable
    long-range bomber, additional

F/A-18

E/F
    aircraft to offset the reduction in the F-35 aircraft, as well
    as numerous opportunities to apply our unmanned airborne
    technologies and capabilities and our broad sensor technologies
    to new products and to upgrade several existing platforms.

While the real rate of growth in the top line defense budget may
    be slowing for the first time since 9/11, the
    U.S. Government’s budgetary process continues to give
    us good visibility regarding future spending and the threat
    areas that it is addressing. We believe that our current
    contracts, and our strong backlog of previously awarded
    contracts align well with our customer’s future needs, and
    this provides us with good insight regarding future cash flows
    from our businesses. Nonetheless, we recognize that no business
    is immune to the current economic situation and new policy
    initiatives could adversely affect future defense spending
    levels, which could lower our expected future revenues. Certain
    programs in which we participate may be subject to potential
    reductions due to this slower rate of growth in the
    U.S. defense budget and the utilization of funds to support
    the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Liquidity Trends

– In light of the ongoing
    economic situation, we have evaluated our future liquidity
    needs, both from a short-term and long-term perspective. We
    expect that cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus cash
    generated from operations and cash available under credit lines
    will be sufficient in 2011 to service debt, finance capital
    expansion projects, pay federal, foreign, and state income
    taxes, fund pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, and
    continue paying dividends to shareholders. We have a committed
    $2 billion revolving credit facility, with a maturity date
    of August 10, 2012, that can be accessed on a

same-day

basis.

We believe we can obtain additional capital to provide for
    long-term liquidity, if necessary, from such sources as the
    public or private capital markets, the sale of assets, sale and
    leaseback of operating assets, and leasing rather than
    purchasing new assets. We have an effective shelf registration
    statement on file with the SEC. See Liquidity and Capital
    Resources below for further discussions about our financing
    activities.

Industry
    Factors

We are subject to the unique characteristics of the
    U.S. defense industry as a monopsony, whereby demand for
    our products and services comes primarily from one customer, and
    by certain elements peculiar to our own business mix.

Recent Developments in U.S. Cost Accounting Standards
    (CAS) Pension Recovery Rules

– On May 10,
    2010, the CAS Board published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
    (NPRM) that if adopted would provide a framework to partially
    harmonize the CAS rules with the Pension Protection Act of 2006
    (PPA) funding requirements. The NPRM would “harmonize”
    by mitigating the mismatch between CAS costs and

PPA-amended

Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding
    requirements. Until the final rule is published, and to the
    extent that the final rule does not completely eliminate
    mismatches between ERISA funding requirements and CAS pension
    costs, government contractors maintaining defined benefit
    pension plans will continue to experience a timing mismatch
    between required contributions and pension expenses recoverable
    under CAS. The final rule is expected to be issued in 2011 and
    to apply to contracts starting the year following the award of
    the first CAS covered contract after the effective date of the
    new rule. This would mean the rule would apply to our contracts
    in 2012. We anticipate that contractors will be entitled to an
    equitable adjustment for any additional CAS contract costs
    resulting from the final rule.

Economic
    Opportunities, Challenges, and Risks

The United States continues to face a complex and rapidly
    changing national security environment, while simultaneously
    addressing domestic economic challenges such as unemployment,
    federal budget deficits and the growing national debt. The
    U.S. Government’s investment in capabilities that
    respond to constantly evolving threats is increasingly being
    balanced against the need to address domestic economic
    challenges. We believe that

-29-

the U.S. Government will continue to place a high priority
    on defense spending and national security, as well as economic
    challenges, and will continue to invest in sophisticated systems
    providing long-range surveillance and intelligence, battle
    management, precision strike, and strategic agility.

The U.S. Government faces the additional challenge of
    recapitalizing equipment and rebuilding readiness while also
    pursuing modernization and reducing overhead and inefficiency.
    The DoD has announced several initiatives to improve efficiency,
    refocus priorities and enhance DoD business practices including
    those used to procure goods and services from defense
    contractors.

The DoD initiatives are organized into five major areas:
    affordability and cost growth; productivity and innovation;
    competition; services acquisition; and processes and
    bureaucracy. Initial plans resulting from these initiatives were
    announced in early 2010 and the defense department expects that
    these initiatives will generate $100 billion in savings. On
    January 6, 2011, Secretary Gates provided initial details
    on fiscal year 2012 defense budget and programmatic plans and
    elaborated on the allocation of the $100 billion in
    expected savings from efficiency initiatives. The Secretary
    described plans to allocate $28 billion for increased
    operating costs and $70 billion for investment in high
    priority capabilities. In addition to the efficiency savings,
    the DoD plans to reduce defense spending from its prior plans by
    $78 billion over the next five fiscal years.

At the date of this report, the fiscal year 2012 defense budget
    has not been submitted by the President and Congress had not yet
    passed a baseline fiscal year 2011 defense budget or any of the
    appropriations funding bills relating to our customer base. As a
    result, the U.S. Government is currently operating under a
    Continuing Resolution (CR) that funds programs and services at
    fiscal year 2010 levels. The CR is set to expire on
    March 4, 2011, after which Congress will either pass a new
    appropriations bill or extend a CR. The latter case would likely
    fund programs at fiscal year 2010 levels and would affect the
    profitability of some of our programs and potentially delay new
    awards. We anticipate continued spirited debate over defense
    spending in 2011 as part of a larger dialog around the federal
    deficit and potential cuts in government spending. Budget
    decisions made in this environment could have long-term
    consequences for our company and the entire defense industry.

Although reductions to certain programs in which we participate
    or for which we expect to compete are always possible, we
    believe that spending on recapitalization, modernization and
    maintenance of defense and homeland security assets will
    continue to be a national priority. Future defense spending is
    expected to include the development and procurement of new
    manned and unmanned military platforms and systems along with
    advanced electronics and software to enhance the capabilities of
    individual systems and provide for the real-time integration of
    individual surveillance, information management, strike, and
    battle management platforms. Given the current era of irregular
    warfare, we expect an increase in investment in persistent
    awareness with intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
    (ISR) systems, cyber warfare, and expansion of information
    available for the warfighter to make timely decisions. Other
    significant new competitive opportunities include long range
    strike, directed energy applications, missile defense, satellite
    communications systems, restricted programs, cybersecurity,
    technical services and information technology contracts, and
    numerous international and homeland security programs.

Prime contracts with various agencies of the
    U.S. Government and subcontracts with other prime
    contractors are subject to numerous procurement and other
    regulations, including the False Claims Act and the
    International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the
    Arms Export Control Act. Noncompliance found by any one agency
    could result in fines, penalties, debarment, or suspension from
    receiving contracts with all U.S. Government agencies. We
    could experience material adverse effects on our business
    operations if we or a portion of our business were suspended or
    debarred.

We could be affected by future laws or regulations, including
    those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other
    actions known as “green initiatives.” We recently
    established a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions over
    a

five-year

period through December 31, 2014. To comply with existing
    green initiatives and our greenhouse gas emissions goal, we
    expect to incur capital and operating costs, but at this time

-30-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

we do not expect that such costs will have a material adverse
    effect upon our financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

See Risk Factors located in Part I, Item 1A for a more
    complete description of risks faced by us and the defense
    industry.

BUSINESS
    ACQUISITIONS


– We acquired Sonoma Photonics, Inc., as
    well as assets from Swift Engineering’s Killer Bee Unmanned
    Air Systems product line in April 2009 for an aggregate amount
    of approximately $33 million. The operating results from
    the date of acquisition are reported in the Aerospace Systems
    segment from the date of acquisition.


– We acquired 3001 International, Inc.
    (3001 Inc.) in October 2008 for approximately $92 million
    in cash. 3001 Inc. provides geospatial data production and
    analysis, including airborne imaging, surveying, mapping and
    geographic information systems for U.S. and international
    government intelligence, defense and civilian customers. The
    operating results of 3001 Inc. are reported in the Information
    Systems segment from the date of acquisition.

BUSINESS
    DISPOSITIONS


– We sold our Advisory Services Division
    (ASD) in December 2009, for $1.65 billion in cash to an
    investor group led by General Atlantic, LLC and affiliates of
    Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., and recognized a
    gain of $15 million, net of taxes. ASD was a business unit
    comprised of the assets and liabilities of TASC, Inc., its
    wholly-owned subsidiary TASC Services Corporation, and certain
    contracts carved out from other businesses also in Information
    Systems that provide systems engineering technical assistance
    (SETA) and other analysis and advisory services. Sales for ASD
    in the years ended December 31, 2009, and 2008, were
    approximately $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion,
    respectively. The assets, liabilities and operating results of
    this business unit are reported as discontinued operations in
    the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

2008 –

We sold our Electro-Optical Systems
    (EOS) business in April 2008 for $175 million in cash to
    L-3 Communications Corporation and recognized a gain of
    $19 million, net of taxes. EOS, formerly a part of the
    Electronic Systems segment, produces night vision and applied
    optics products. Sales for this business through April 2008 were
    approximately $53 million. The assets, liabilities and
    operating results of this business are reported as discontinued
    operations in the consolidated financial statements for all
    periods presented.

CONTRACTS

We generate the majority of our business from long-term
    government contracts for development, production, and support
    activities. Government contracts typically include the following
    cost elements: direct material, labor

-31-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

and subcontracting costs, and certain indirect costs including
    allowable general and administrative costs. Unless otherwise
    specified in a contract, costs billed to contracts with the
    U.S. Government are determined under the requirements of
    the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and CAS regulations as
    allowable and allocable costs. Examples of costs incurred by us
    and not billed to the U.S. Government in accordance with
    the requirements of the FAR and CAS regulations include, but are
    not limited to, certain legal costs, lobbying costs, charitable
    donations, interest expense and advertising costs.

Our long-term contracts typically fall into one of two broad
    categories:

Flexibly Priced Contracts

– Includes both
    cost-type and fixed-price incentive contracts. Cost-type
    contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s
    allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit.
    Cost-type contracts generally require that the contractor use
    its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some
    specified time and some stated dollar limitation. Fixed-price
    incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the
    contractor’s allowable costs, but are subject to a
    cost-share limit which affects profitability. Fixed-price
    incentive contracts effectively become firm fixed-price
    contracts once the cost-share limit is reached.

Firm Fixed-Price Contracts

– A firm fixed-price
    contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is
    agreed to for a price that is a pre-determined, negotiated
    amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of
    costs incurred by the contractor.

Time-and-materials

contracts are considered firm fixed-price contracts as they
    specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged.

Contract Fees

– Negotiated contract fee
    structures, for both flexibly priced and fixed-price contracts
    include, but are not limited to: fixed-fee amounts, cost sharing
    arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost
    target performance, positive award fees, and negative penalty
    arrangements. Profit margins may vary materially depending on
    the negotiated contract fee arrangements,

percentage-of-completion

of the contract, the achievement of performance objectives, and
    the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees,
    particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally
    determined.

Award Fees

– Certain contracts contain
    provisions consisting of award fees based on performance
    criteria such as cost, schedule, quality, and technical
    performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on an
    evaluation by the customer of the company’s performance
    against such negotiated criteria. Fees that can be reasonably
    assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the
    performance period of the contract. Award fee contracts are used
    in certain of our operating segments. Examples of significant
    long-term contracts with substantial negotiated award fee
    amounts are the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned
    Aircraft System and the majority of satellite contracts.

Compliance and Monitoring

– We monitor our
    policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a
    regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar
    terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable
    government regulations. In addition, costs incurred and
    allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are
    routinely audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS

Revenue
    Recognition

Overview

– We derive the majority of our
    business from long-term contracts for the production of goods
    and services provided to the federal government, which are
    accounted for in conformity with accounting principles

-32-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for
    construction-type and production-type contracts and federal
    government contractors. We classify contract revenues as product
    sales or service revenues depending on the predominant
    attributes of the relevant underlying contract. We also enter
    into contracts that are not associated with the federal
    government, such as contracts to provide certain services to
    non-federal government customers. We account for those contracts
    in accordance with the relevant GAAP revenue recognition
    principles.

We consider the nature of these contracts and the types of
    products and services provided when determining the proper
    accounting method for a particular contract.

Percentage-of-Completion

Accounting

– We generally recognize revenues from
    our long-term contracts under the

cost-to-cost

or the

units-of-delivery

measures of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting. The

percentage-of-completion

method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses. For
    most contracts, sales are calculated based on the percentage of
    total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at
    completion of the contract. For certain contracts with large
    up-front purchases of material, primarily in the Shipbuilding
    segment, sales are generally calculated based on the percentage
    that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct
    labor costs. The

units-of-delivery

measure is a modification of the

percentage-of-completion

method, which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the
    customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with
    the contract terms. We estimate profit as the difference between
    total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract
    and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on
    deliveries.

The use of the

percentage-of-completion

method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost
    estimates for the design, manufacture, and delivery of our
    products and services. Such costs are typically incurred over a
    period of several years, and estimation of these costs requires
    the use of judgment. We record sales under cost-type contracts
    as costs are incurred.

Many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives
    based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that
    may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product. These
    incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be
    earned or penalties to be incurred. Incentives and award fees
    that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are
    recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentives
    and award fees that are not reasonably assured or cannot be
    reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time
    as a reasonable estimate can be made.

Other changes in estimates of contract sales, costs, and profits
    are recognized using the cumulative

catch-up

method of accounting. This method recognizes in the current
    period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior
    periods. Hence, the effect of the changes on future periods of
    contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate
    had been the original estimate. A significant change in an
    estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect
    on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Certain Service Contracts

– We generally
    recognize revenue under contracts to provide services to
    non-federal government customers when services are performed.
    Service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts,
    and outsourcing-type arrangements, primarily in Technical
    Services and Information Systems. We generally recognize revenue
    under such contracts on a straight-line basis over the period of
    contract performance, unless evidence suggests that the revenue
    is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different
    pattern. Costs incurred under these service contracts are
    expensed as incurred, except that direct and incremental

set-up

costs
    are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement.
    Operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate
    from period to period, particularly in the earlier phases of the
    contract.

Contracts that include more than one type of product or service
    are accounted for under the relevant GAAP guidance for revenue
    arrangements with multiple-elements. Accordingly, for applicable
    arrangements, revenue recognition includes the proper
    identification of separate units of accounting and the
    allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair
    values.

Cost Estimation

– The cost estimation process
    requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional
    knowledge and experience of our engineers, program managers, and
    financial professionals. Factors that are

-33-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate
    contract recovery include the availability, productivity and
    cost of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be
    performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of
    materials, the effect of any delays in performance, the
    availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the
    recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to
    complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more
    contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated
    financial position or results of operations. We update our
    contract cost estimates at least annually and more frequently as
    determined by events or circumstances. We generally review and
    reassess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant
    contract on a quarterly basis.

We record a provision for the entire loss on the contract in the
    period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to
    be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to
    be earned. We offset loss provisions first against costs that
    are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried
    assets, with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities.

Purchase
    Accounting and Goodwill

Overview

– We allocate the purchase price of an
    acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their
    respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as
    goodwill. Such fair market value assessments require judgments
    and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and
    other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ
    materially from original estimates. Adjustments to the fair
    value of purchased assets and liabilities after the measurement
    period are recognized in net earnings.

Acquisition Accruals

– We establish certain
    accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies
    from our acquisitions and divestitures. We have recorded these
    accruals and subsequent adjustments during the purchase price
    allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for
    divestitures. The accruals were determined based upon the terms
    of the purchase or sales agreements and, in most cases, involve
    a significant degree of judgment. We recorded these accruals in
    accordance with our interpretation of the terms of the purchase
    or sale agreements, known facts, and an estimation of probable
    future events based on our experience.

Tests for Impairment

– We perform impairment
    tests for goodwill as of November 30th of each year,
    or when evidence of potential impairment exists. We record a
    charge to operations when we determine that an impairment has
    occurred. In order to test for potential impairment, we use a
    discounted cash flow analysis, corroborated by comparative
    market multiples where appropriate.

The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis
    requiring judgment are the projected results of operations,
    weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and terminal value
    assumptions. The WACC takes into account the relative weights of
    each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and
    debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted
    as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with
    longer-term contracts and barriers to market entry. The terminal
    value assumptions are applied to the final year of the
    discounted cash flow model.

As a result of our announcement to wind down operations at
    Shipbuilding’s Avondale, Louisiana facility (see
    Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8), we performed an interim impairment
    test on Shipbuilding’s goodwill as of June 30, 2010,
    and concluded that the estimated fair value of the Shipbuilding
    reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value.

The results of our annual goodwill impairment test as of
    November 30, 2010, indicated that the estimated fair value
    of all reporting units were substantially in excess of their
    carrying values.

Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a
    business’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded
    goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material effect
    on the results of our impairment analysis.

Litigation,
    Commitments, and Contingencies

Overview

– We are subject to a range of claims,
    lawsuits, environmental and income tax matters, and
    administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these
    matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional
    knowledge and experience of management and our internal and
    external legal counsel. In accordance with our practices
    relating to accounting for contingencies, we record amounts as
    charges to earnings after taking into consideration the facts
    and circumstances of each matter known to us, including any
    settlement offers, and determine that it is probable that a
    liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
    reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of any such
    exposure to us may vary from earlier estimates as further facts
    and circumstances become known. When a range of costs is
    possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate
    than another, we record the minimum amount of the range.

U.S. Government Claims

– From time to
    time, our customers advise us of ordinary course claims and
    penalties concerning certain potential disallowed costs. When
    such findings are presented, we engage U.S. Government
    representatives in discussions to enable us to evaluate the
    merits of these claims as well as to assess the amounts being
    claimed. Where appropriate, provisions are made to reflect our
    expected exposure to the matters raised by the
    U.S. Government representatives and such provisions are
    reviewed on a quarterly basis for sufficiency based on the most
    recent information available.

Environmental Accruals

– We are subject to the
    environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which
    we conduct operations. We record a liability for the costs of
    expected environmental remediation obligations when we determine
    that it is probable we will incur such costs, and the amount of
    the liability can be reasonably estimated. When a range of costs
    is possible and no amount within that range is a better estimate
    than another, we record the minimum amount of the range.

Factors which could result in changes to the assessment of
    probability, range of estimated costs, and environmental
    accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions,
    increase or decrease in the estimated time required to
    remediate, discovery of more extensive contamination than
    anticipated, results of efforts to involve other legally
    responsible parties, financial insolvency of other responsible
    parties, changes in laws and regulations or contractual
    obligations affecting remediation requirements, and improvements
    in remediation technology.

Litigation Accruals

– Litigation accruals are
    recorded as charges to earnings when management, after taking
    into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter,
    including any settlement offers, has determined that it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate resolution of
    any exposure to us may vary from earlier estimates as further
    facts and circumstances become known to us.

Uncertain Tax Positions –

Tax positions meeting
    the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold may be recognized
    or continue to be recognized in the financial statements. The
    timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the
    applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income
    taxes. If a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory
    threshold to avoid payment of penalties, we recognize an expense
    for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is
    claimed in our tax return. We recognize interest accrued related
    to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Penalties,
    if probable and reasonably estimable, are recognized as a
    component of income tax expense. See Note 11 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.
    Under existing GAAP, prior to January 1, 2009, changes in
    accruals associated with uncertainties arising from the
    resolution of pre-acquisition contingencies of acquired
    businesses were charged or credited to goodwill; effective
    January 1, 2009, such changes will be recorded to income
    tax expense. Adjustments to other tax accruals are generally
    recorded in earnings in the period they are determined.

Retirement
    Benefits

Overview

– We annually evaluate assumptions
    used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair
    values of plan assets for our pension plans and other
    post-retirement benefits plans in consultation with our outside

-35-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

actuaries. In the event that we determine that plan amendments
    or changes in the assumptions are warranted, future pension and
    post-retirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease.

Assumptions

– The principal assumptions that
    have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position
    and results of operations are the discount rate, the expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets, the health care cost
    trend rate and the estimated fair market value of plan assets.
    For certain plan assets where the fair market value is not
    readily determinable, such as real estate, private equity, and
    hedge funds, estimates of fair value are determined using the
    best information available.

Discount Rate

– The discount rate represents
    the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of
    future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle
    the pension and post-retirement benefit obligations. The
    discount rate is generally based on the yield of high-quality
    corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, the
    discount rate is primarily determined using the results of bond
    yield curve models based on a portfolio of high quality bonds
    matching the notional cash inflows with the expected benefit
    payments for each significant benefit plan. Taking into
    consideration the factors noted above, our weighted-average
    pension composite discount rate was 5.76 percent at
    December 31, 2010, and 6.03 percent at
    December 31, 2009. Holding all other assumptions constant,
    and since net actuarial gains and losses were in excess of the
    10 percent accounting corridor in 2010, an increase or
    decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption
    for 2010 would have decreased or increased pension and
    post-retirement benefit expense for 2010 by approximately
    $80 million, of which $3 million relates to
    post-retirement benefits, and decreased or increased the amount
    of the benefit obligation recorded at December 31, 2010, by
    approximately $850 million, of which $70 million
    relates to post-retirement benefits. The effects of hypothetical
    changes in the discount rate for a single year may not be
    representative and may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future
    years because of the application of the accounting corridor. The
    accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization
    of net gains and losses is not required. Due to adverse capital
    market conditions in 2008 our pension plan assets experienced a
    negative return of approximately 16 percent in 2008. As a
    result, substantially all of our plans experienced net actuarial
    losses outside the 10 percent accounting corridor at the
    end of 2008, thus requiring accumulated gains and losses to be
    amortized to expense. As a result of this condition, sensitivity
    of net periodic pension costs to changes in the discount rate
    were much higher in 2009 and 2010 than was the case in 2008 and
    prior. This condition is expected to continue into the near
    future.

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return –

The
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets represents the
    average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested in a
    specified target asset allocation to provide for anticipated
    future benefit payment obligations. For 2010 and 2009, we
    assumed an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of
    8.5 percent. An increase or decrease of 25 basis
    points in the expected long-term rate of return assumption for
    2010, holding all other assumptions constant, would increase or
    decrease our pension and post-retirement benefit expense for
    2010 by approximately $54 million, of which $2 million
    relates to post-retirement benefits.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

– The health care
    cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the
    cost of health care benefits based on external estimates of
    health care inflation, changes in health care utilization or
    delivery patterns, technological advances, and changes in the
    health status of the plan participants. Using a combination of
    market expectations and economic projections including the
    effect of health care reform, we selected an expected initial
    health care cost trend rate of 8 percent for 2011 and an
    ultimate health care cost trend rate of 5 percent reached
    in 2017. In 2009, we assumed an expected initial health care
    cost trend rate of 7 percent for 2010 and an ultimate
    health care cost trend rate of 5 percent reached in 2014.
    Although our actual cost experience is much lower at this time,
    market conditions and the potential effects of health care
    reform are expected to increase medical cost trends in the next
    one to three years thus our past experience may not reflect
    future conditions.

2010 –

Cost of product sales in 2010 increased
    $229 million, or 1 percent, over 2009 primarily due to
    the higher sales volume described above. The decrease in cost of
    product sales as a percentage of product sales was primarily due
    to lower GAAP pension expenses and performance improvements in
    Aerospace Systems and Electronic Systems.

Cost of service revenues in 2010 increased $250 million, or
    2 percent, over 2009 and as a percentage of service
    revenues increased 90 basis points, primarily due to
    program mix changes at Information Systems.

2009 –

Cost of product sales in 2009 increased
    $1.1 billion, or 7 percent, over 2008 primarily due to
    the higher sales volume described above. The increase in cost of
    product sales as a percentage of product sales was primarily due
    to higher GAAP pension costs across all of our businesses.

Cost of service revenues in 2009 increased $654 million, or
    6 percent, over 2008 primarily due to the higher sales
    volume described above. The increase in cost of service revenues
    as a percentage of service revenues was primarily due to higher
    GAAP pension costs across all of our businesses.

See the Segment Operating Results section below for further
    information.

General and Administrative Expenses

– In
    accordance with industry practice and the regulations that
    govern the cost accounting requirements for government
    contracts, most general corporate expenses incurred at both the
    segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and
    allocable costs on government contracts. For most components of
    the company, these costs are allocated to contracts in progress
    on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include
    this cost component as an element of cost. General and
    administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations.
    General and administrative expenses for 2010 decreased
    $64 million from the prior year primarily due to the 2009
    disposition of ASD at our Information Systems segment. General
    and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales and
    service revenues decreased from 9.3 percent in 2009 to
    8.9 percent in 2010, primarily due to cost reductions
    realized from the 2009 streamlining of our organizational
    structure from seven to five operating segments. General and
    administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales and
    service revenues decreased from 9.7 percent in 2008 to
    9.3 percent in 2009, primarily due to lower corporate
    overhead costs and a $64 million gain from a legal
    settlement in 2009, net of legal provisions and related expenses.

Goodwill Impairment

– In 2008, we recorded a
    non-cash charge totaling $3.1 billion at Aerospace Systems
    and Shipbuilding as a result of adverse equity market conditions
    that caused a decrease in market multiples and our stock price.

Operating
    Income (Loss)

We consider operating income to be an important measure for
    evaluating our operating performance and, as is typical in the
    industry, we define operating income as revenues less the
    related cost of producing the revenues and general and
    administrative expenses. We also further evaluate operating
    income for each of the business segments in which we operate.

We internally manage our operations by reference to
    “segment operating income.” Segment operating income
    is defined as operating income before unallocated expenses and
    net pension adjustment, neither of which affect the operating
    results of segments, and the reversal of royalty income, which
    is classified as “other, net” for financial reporting
    purposes. Segment operating income is one of the key metrics we
    use to evaluate operating performance. Segment operating income
    is not, however, a measure of financial performance under GAAP,
    and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the
    same manner.

The table below reconciles segment operating income to total
    operating income:

Segment
    Operating Income (Loss)

Segment operating income in 2010 increased $397 million, or
    14 percent, as compared with 2009. Total segment operating
    income was 9.6 percent and 8.7 percent of total sales
    and service revenues in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
    increase in 2010 segment operating income is primarily due to
    the 3 percent increase in sales volume and performance
    improvements across all operating segments. Segment operating
    income in 2009 was $2.9 billion as compared with segment
    operating loss of $299 million in 2008. The loss in 2008
    was primarily due to goodwill impairment charges totaling
    $3.1 billion at Aerospace Systems and Shipbuilding. See
    discussion of Segment Operating Results below for further
    information.

Unallocated
    Corporate Expenses

Unallocated corporate expenses generally include the portion of
    corporate expenses not considered allowable or allocable under
    applicable CAS and FAR rules, and therefore not allocated to the
    segments, such as management and administration, legal,
    environmental, certain compensation and retiree benefits, and
    other expenses. Unallocated corporate expenses for 2010
    increased $109 million, or 98 percent, as compared
    with 2009, primarily due to inclusion of a $64 million net
    gain from a legal settlement in 2009, as well as an increase in
    environmental, health and welfare, and stock compensation
    expenses in 2010. Unallocated corporate expenses for 2009
    decreased $46 million, or 29 percent, as compared with
    2008, primarily due to a $64 million gain from a legal
    settlement in 2009, net of legal provisions and related
    expenses, partially offset by higher costs related to
    environmental remediation and post-retirement employee benefits.

Net
    Pension Adjustment

Net pension adjustment reflects the difference between pension
    expenses determined in accordance with GAAP and pension expense
    allocated to the operating segments determined in accordance
    with CAS. The pension adjustment in 2010 decreased by
    $286 million as compared with 2009 primarily due to lower
    GAAP pension expense as a result of favorable returns on pension
    plan assets in 2009. The net pension adjustment in 2009 was an
    expense of $311 million, as compared with income of
    $263 million in 2008. The net pension expense in 2009 was
    primarily the result of negative returns on plan assets in 2008.

Royalty
    Income Adjustment

Royalty income is included in segment operating income and
    reclassified to other income for financial reporting purposes.
    See Other, net below.

Interest
    Expense


– Interest expense in 2010 was comparable
    to 2009.


– Interest expense in 2009 decreased
    $14 million, or 5 percent, as compared with 2008. The
    decrease is primarily due to higher capitalized interest and
    lower interest rates.

Charge on
    Debt Redemption


– In November 2010, we repurchased
    outstanding debt held by our subsidiaries, Northrop Grumman
    Systems Corporation and Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding, Inc., and
    recorded a pre-tax charge of $231 million primarily related
    to premiums paid on the debt tendered. See Liquidity and Capital
    Resources below and Note 14 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8.

Other,
    net


– Other, net for 2010 decreased
    $27 million as compared with 2009, primarily due to lower
    royalty income and lower returns on investments in marketable
    securities used as a funding source for non-qualified employee
    benefits.


– Other, net for 2009 increased
    $26 million as compared with 2008, primarily due to
    positive

mark-to-market

adjustments on investments in marketable securities used as
    funding for non-qualified employee benefits and a gain from the
    recovery of a loan to an affiliate, which more than offset the
    benefit in the prior year of $60 million of royalty income
    from patent infringement settlements.

Federal
    and Foreign Income Taxes


– Our effective tax rate on earnings from
    continuing operations for 2010 was 21.5 percent compared
    with 30.6 percent in 2009. In 2010, we recognized net tax
    benefits of approximately $296 million to reflect the final
    approval from the IRS and the U.S. Congressional Joint
    Committee on Taxation (Joint Committee) of the IRS’
    examination of our tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006.
    In 2009, we recognized net tax benefits of approximately
    $75 million primarily as a result of a final settlement
    with the IRS Office of Appeals and the Joint Committee related
    to our tax returns for years ended 2001 through 2003.


– Our effective tax rate on earnings from
    continuing operations for 2009 was 30.6 percent compared
    with 33.8 percent in 2008 (excluding the non-cash,
    non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $3.1 billion
    at Aerospace Systems and Shipbuilding). The 2009 tax rate
    reflects net tax benefits of approximately $75 million
    related to a final settlement with the IRS as discussed above.

Discontinued
    Operations


– Earnings from discontinued operations,
    net of tax was $15 million and is primarily attributable to
    adjustments to the gain on the 2009 sale of ASD to reflect
    purchase price adjustments and the utilization of additional
    capital loss carry-forwards.


– Earnings from discontinued operations,
    net of tax was $113 million for 2009, compared with
    $117 million in 2008. The earnings were primarily
    attributable to the operating results and gain on disposition of
    ASD, which was sold in December 2009. See Note 6 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

Diluted
    Earnings (Loss) Per Share


– Diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations in 2010 were $6.77 per share, as compared
    with $4.87 diluted earnings per share in 2009. Diluted earnings
    per share are based on weighted-average diluted shares
    outstanding of 301.1 million for 2010 and
    323.3 million for 2009, respectively.


– Diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations in 2009 were $4.87 per share, as compared
    with $4.12 diluted loss per share in 2008. Earnings per share
    are based on weighted-average diluted shares outstanding

-41-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

of 323.3 million for 2009 and weighted average basic shares
    outstanding of 334.5 million for 2008. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the potential dilutive effect of
    7.1 million shares from stock options, stock awards, and
    the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock were excluded from
    the computation of weighted average shares outstanding as the
    shares would have had an anti-dilutive effect. The goodwill
    impairment charge of $3.1 billion at Aerospace Systems and
    Shipbuilding reduced our 2008 diluted earnings per share from
    continuing operations by $9.15 per share.

Net Cash
    Provided by Operating Activities


– Net cash provided by operating
    activities in 2010 was $2.5 billion as compared with
    $2.1 billion in 2009 and reflects improved cash collections
    from our customers and lower tax payments, primarily due to
    $508 million taxes paid in 2009 related to the sale of ASD.
    In 2010, we contributed $894 million to our pension plans,
    of which $830 million was voluntarily pre-funded, as
    compared with $858 million in 2009, of which
    $800 million was voluntarily pre-funded. Income taxes paid,
    net of refunds, was $1.1 billion in 2010, as compared with
    $1.3 billion in 2009.

Net cash provided by operating activities for 2010 included
    $94 million of federal and state income tax refunds and
    $11 million of interest income received.


– Net cash provided by operating
    activities in 2009 was $2.1 billion compared with
    $3.2 billion in 2008 and reflects higher pension plan
    contributions and income tax payments. In 2009, we contributed
    $858 million to our pension plans, of which
    $800 million was voluntarily pre-funded, as compared with
    $320 million in 2008, of which $200 million was
    voluntarily pre-funded. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, was
    $1.3 billion in 2009, as compared with $719 million in
    2008. Income taxes paid in 2009 included $508 million
    resulting from the sale of ASD.

Net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 included
    $171 million of federal and state income tax refunds and
    $11 million of interest income.

SEGMENT
    OPERATING RESULTS

Basis of
    Presentation

We are aligned into five reportable segments: Aerospace Systems,
    Electronic Systems, Information Systems, Shipbuilding and
    Technical Services. See Note 8 in Part II, Item 8
    for more information about our segments.

In January 2010, we transferred our internal information
    technology services unit from the Information Systems segment to
    our corporate shared services group. The intersegment sales and
    operating income for this unit that were previously recognized
    in the Information Systems segment are immaterial and have been
    eliminated for the years presented.

KEY
    SEGMENT FINANCIAL MEASURES

Operating
    Performance Assessment and Reporting

We manage and assess the performance of our businesses based on
    our performance on individual contracts and programs obtained
    generally from government organizations using the financial
    measures referred to below, with consideration given to the
    Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments described
    on page 32. As indicated in our discussion on
    “Contracts” on page 31, our portfolio of
    long-term contracts is largely flexibly-priced, which means that
    sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large
    portfolio of active contracts, with operating income being a
    critical measure of operational performance. Due to FAR rules
    that govern our business, most types of costs are allowable, and
    we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as cost of
    sales or general and administrative costs) as much as we do on
    total contract costs, which are a key factor in determining
    contract operating income. As a result, in evaluating our
    operating performance, we look primarily at changes in sales and
    service revenues, and operating income, including the effects of
    significant changes in operating income as a result of changes
    in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative

catch-up

method of accounting in accordance with GAAP. Unusual
    fluctuations in operating performance attributable to changes in
    a specific cost element across multiple contracts, however, are
    described in our analysis. Based on this approach and the nature
    of our operations, the discussion of results of operations
    generally focuses around our five segments versus distinguishing
    between products and services. Our Aerospace Systems, Electronic
    Systems and Shipbuilding segments generate predominantly product
    sales, while the Information Systems and Technical Services
    segments generate predominantly service revenues.

Sales and
    Service Revenues

Period-to-period

sales reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts.
    Changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in
    terms of volume. Unless otherwise described, volume generally
    refers to increases (or decreases) in reported revenues due to
    varying production activity levels, delivery rates, or service
    levels on individual contracts. Volume changes will typically
    carry a corresponding income change based on the margin rate for
    a particular contract.

-43-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Segment
    Operating Income

Segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance
    results of contracts within a business area or segment. Excluded
    from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with
    contract performance, including the portion of corporate
    expenses such as management and administration, legal,
    environmental, certain compensation and other retiree benefits,
    and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under
    applicable CAS regulations and the FAR, and therefore not
    allocated to the segments. Changes in segment operating income
    are typically expressed in terms of volume, as discussed above,
    or performance. Performance refers to changes in contract margin
    rates. These changes typically relate to profit recognition
    associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion
    of the contract (EAC) that reflect improved (or deteriorated)
    operating performance on a particular contract. Operating income
    changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the
    time an EAC change is recorded.

Operating income may also be affected by, among other things,
    the effects of workforce stoppages, natural disasters (such as
    hurricanes and earthquakes), resolution of disputed items with
    the customer, recovery of insurance proceeds, and other discrete
    events. At the completion of a long-term contract, any
    originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully
    utilized (such as warranty reserves) could also impact contract
    earnings. Where such items have occurred, and the effects are
    material, a separate description is provided.

For a more complete understanding of each segment’s product
    and services, see the business descriptions in Part I,
    Item 1.

Sales and
    Service Revenues

2010 –

Aerospace Systems revenue increased
    $491 million, or 5 percent, as compared with 2009. The
    increase is primarily due to $517 million higher sales in
    Battle Management & Engagement Systems (BM&ES)
    and $218 million higher sales in Strike &
    Surveillance Systems (S&SS), partially offset by
    $315 million lower sales in Advanced Programs &
    Technology (AP&T). The increase in BM&ES is due to
    higher sales volume on the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance
    (BAMS) Unmanned Aircraft System, EA-6B, EA-18G,

E-2

and Long
    Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle (LEMV) programs. The
    increase in S&SS is primarily due to higher sales volume
    associated with manned and unmanned aircraft programs, such as
    the Global Hawk High-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE) Systems, the
    F-35 Lightning II (F-35), B-2 Stealth Bomber and

F/A-18,

partially offset by the termination of the Kinetic Energy
    Interceptor (KEI) program in 2009 and decreased activity on the
    Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) program. The decrease
    in AP&T is primarily due to lower sales volume on
    restricted programs and the Navy Unmanned Combat Air System
    (N-UCAS) program.

2009 –

Aerospace Systems revenue increased
    $594 million, or 6 percent, as compared with 2008. The
    increase was primarily due to $201 million higher sales in
    Space Systems (SS), $201 million higher sales in
    BM&ES, and $191 million higher sales in S&SS. The
    increase in SS was primarily due to the

ramp-up

of
    restricted programs awarded in 2008, partially offset by
    decreased sales volume on the National Polar-orbiting
    Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) and
    cancellation of the Transformational Satellite Communications
    System (TSAT) program. The increase in BM&ES was primarily
    due to higher sales volume on the BAMS Unmanned Aircraft System,
    the

E-2D

Advanced Hawkeye, and the EA-18G programs, partially offset by
    lower

sales volume on the E2-C as the program is nearing completion.
    The increase in S&SS was primarily due to higher sales
    volume from the Global Hawk HALE Systems, F-35,

F/A-18,

and
    B-2 programs, partially offset by decreased activity on the KEI
    program, which was terminated for convenience in 2009, and the
    ICBM program.

Segment
    Operating Income

2010 –

Aerospace Systems operating income
    increased $185 million, or 17 percent, as compared
    with 2009. The increase is primarily due to $128 million in
    net performance improvements across various programs,
    principally within SS, and $57 million from the higher
    sales volume discussed above.

2009 –

Aerospace Systems operating income
    increased $655 million, or 157 percent, as compared
    with 2008. The increase was primarily due to a 2008 goodwill
    impairment charge of $570 million (see Note 12 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8),
    $61 million from the higher sales volume discussed above,
    and $24 million in improved program performance. The
    $24 million in improved program performance was principally
    due to $67 million in performance improvements in S&SS
    programs, primarily related to the ICBM program and the Global
    Hawk HALE Systems, partially offset by $33 million in lower
    performance across various programs in SS and BM&ES.

2010 –

Electronic Systems revenue decreased
    $58 million, or less than 1 percent, as compared with
    2009. The decrease is primarily due to $150 million lower
    sales in Land & Self Protection Systems,
    $84 million lower sales in Intelligence,
    Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR) Systems and
    $82 million lower sales in Naval & Marine
    Systems, partially offset by $186 million higher sales in
    Targeting Systems and $72 million higher sales in Advanced
    Concepts & Technologies. The decrease in
    Land & Self Protection Systems is due to lower sales
    volume on the Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) program as
    it transitions from the development phase to the integration and
    test phase and lower unit deliveries on the Vehicular
    Intercommunications Systems (VIS) program. The decrease in ISR
    Systems is due to lower sales volume on the Space Based Infrared
    Systems (SBIRS) program as it transitions to follow-on
    production, postal automation programs and various international
    programs. The decrease in Naval & Marine Systems is
    due to lower volume on the ship-board Cobra Judy replacement
    radar program. The increase in Targeting Systems is due to
    higher sales volume on the F-35, various laser systems and
    restricted programs and increased unit deliveries of the
    LITENING targeting pod system. The increase in Advanced
    Concepts & Technologies is primarily due to volume on
    restricted programs.

2009 –

Electronic Systems revenue increased
    $623 million, or 9 percent, as compared with 2008. The
    increase was primarily due to $213 million higher sales in
    Targeting Systems, $188 million higher sales in ISR
    Systems, $88 million higher sales in Land & Self
    Protection Systems, $80 million higher sales in Navigation
    Systems and $30 million higher sales in Naval &
    Marine Systems. The increase in Targeting Systems was due to
    higher sales volume on the F-35 and restricted programs. The
    increase in ISR Systems was due to higher sales volume on SBIRS
    follow-on production and intercompany programs. The increase in
    Land & Self Protection Systems was due to higher
    deliveries associated with the Large Aircraft Infrared
    Countermeasures (LAIRCM) program, higher volume on the B-52
    Sustainment and intercompany programs. The increase in
    Navigation Systems was due to higher volume on Inertial and
    Fiber Optic Gyro navigation programs. The increase in
    Naval & Marine Systems was due to higher volume on
    power and propulsion systems for the

Virginia

-class
    submarine program.

Segment
    Operating Income

2010 –

Electronic Systems operating income
    increased $54 million, or 6 percent, as compared with
    2009. The increase is primarily due to net performance
    improvements in land and self protection programs, higher volume
    in Targeting Systems, and lower operating loss provisions in
    postal automation programs.

2009 –

Electronic Systems operating income
    increased $22 million, or 2 percent, as compared with
    2008. The increase was primarily due to $79 million from
    the higher sales volume discussed above, partially offset by
    $57 million in higher unfavorable performance adjustments
    in 2009. The higher unfavorable performance adjustments in 2009
    were due to adjustments of $98 million in ISR Systems,
    primarily on the Flats Sequencing System postal automation
    program, partially offset by favorable performance adjustments
    in targeting systems and land and self protection programs.
    Operating performance adjustments in 2008 included royalty
    income of $60 million and a $20 million charge for the
    MESA Wedgetail program associated with potential liquidated
    damages arising from the prime contractor’s announced
    schedule delay in completing the program.

    decrease is primarily due to $130 million lower sales in
    Intelligence Systems and $57 million lower sales in Civil
    Systems, partially offset by $55 million higher sales in
    Defense Systems. The decrease in Intelligence Systems is
    primarily due to lower sales volume on restricted programs and
    the loss of the Navstar Global Positioning System Operational
    Control Segment (GPS OCX) program. The decrease in Civil Systems
    is primarily due to lower sales volume on the New York City
    Wireless (NYCWiN) and Armed Forces Health Longitudinal
    Technology Application (AHLTA) programs. The increase in Defense
    Systems is primarily due to program growth on Battlefield
    Airborne Communications Node (BACN), Joint National Integration
    Center Research and Development Contract (JRDC) and Integrated
    Battle Command System (IBCS) activities, partially offset by
    lower sales volume on the Trailer Mounted Support System (TMSS)
    program as it nears completion, and decreased Systems and
    Software Engineer Support activities.

2009 –

Information Systems revenue increased
    $362 million, or 4 percent, as compared with 2008. The
    increase was primarily due to $285 million in higher sales
    in Intelligence Systems and $194 million in higher sales in
    Defense Systems, partially offset by $123 million in lower
    sales in Civil Systems. The increase in Intelligence Systems was
    primarily due to program growth on the Counter Narco-Terrorism
    Program Office (CNTPO), Guardrail Common Sensor System
    indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) and certain
    restricted programs, partially offset by lower sales volume on
    the Navstar GPS OCX program. The increase in Defense Systems was
    primarily due to program growth on TMSS, Airborne and
    Maritime/Fixed Stations Joint Tactical Radio Systems and BACN
    programs, partially offset by fewer delivery orders on the Force
    XXI Battle Brigade and Below (FBCB2) I-Kits program. The
    decrease in Civil Systems was primarily due to lower volume on
    NYCWiN and Virginia IT outsourcing (VITA) programs.

2010 –

Shipbuilding revenue increased
    $506 million, or 8 percent, as compared with 2009. The
    increase is due to $388 million higher sales in
    Expeditionary Warfare, $144 million higher sales in
    Aircraft Carriers and $114 million in higher sales in
    Submarines, partially offset by $98 million lower sales in
    Surface Combatants. The increase in Expeditionary Warfare is
    primarily due to higher sales volume on the LPD and LHA
    programs, partially offset by delivery of the LHD 8 in 2009. In
    the second quarter of 2010, we announced the wind-down of
    shipbuilding operations at the Avondale, Louisiana facility in
    2013 (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements
    in Part II, Item 8) and reduced revenues by
    $115 million to reflect revised estimates to complete LPDs
    23 and 25. In the year-ended December 31, 2009, we reduced
    revenues by $160 million to reflect revised estimates to
    complete the LPD-class ships and the LHA 6. The increase in
    Aircraft Carriers is primarily due to higher sales volume on the
    Gerald R. Ford construction program and the USS

Theodore
    Roosevelt

Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH), partially
    offset by the delivery of USS

George H.W. Bush

and
    re-delivery of the USS

Enterprise

and USS

Carl Vinson

in early 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in
    Submarines is due to higher sales volume on the

Virginia

-class submarines. The decrease in Surface
    Combatants is due to lower sales volume on the DDG programs.

2009 –

Shipbuilding revenue increased
    $68 million, or 1 percent, as compared with 2008. The
    increase was due to $180 million higher sales in
    Submarines, $58 million higher sales in Expeditionary
    Warfare and $39 million higher sales in Aircraft Carriers,
    partially offset by $113 million lower sales in Fleet
    Support and $109 million lower sales in Surface Combatants.
    The increase in Submarines was primarily due to higher sales
    volume on the construction of the

Virginia

-class
    submarines. The increase in Expeditionary Warfare was due to
    higher sales volume in the LPD program due to production

ramp-ups,

partially offset by the delivery of the LHD 8. The decrease in
    Fleet Support was primarily due to the redelivery of the USS

Toledo

submarine in the first quarter of 2009 and
    decreased carrier fleet support services. The decrease in
    Surface Combatants was primarily due to lower sales volume on
    the DDG 51 program.

Segment
    Operating Income (Loss)

2010 –

Shipbuilding operating income increased
    $26 million, or 9 percent, as compared with 2009,
    primarily due to the higher sales volume discussed above.
    Operating income in 2010 includes the effects of unfavorable
    performance adjustments on Expeditionary Warfare programs,
    partially offset by milestone incentives on the LPD contracts.
    In Expeditionary Warfare, we recorded unfavorable performance
    adjustments of $132 million on LPDs 22 through 25,
    including the effect of a $113 million charge for the
    cumulative effect of the $210 million of incremental costs
    expected in connection with our decision to wind down
    shipbuilding operations at the Avondale facility in 2013 (see
    Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8). Additionally, we recognized an
    unfavorable adjustment of $30 million to reflect additional
    costs to complete post-delivery work for the LHD 8. In 2009,
    operating income included $38 million and $171 million
    in unfavorable performance adjustments on the DDG 51 and LPD 17
    programs, partially offset by a $54 million favorable
    adjustment on the LHD 8 contract.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

2009 –

Shipbuilding operating income was
    $299 million as compared with operating loss of
    $2.3 billion in 2008. The increase was primarily due to the
    2008 goodwill impairment charge of $2.5 billion (See
    Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8), and improved performance in
    Expeditionary Warfare as compared to 2008. In 2008, the
    Expeditionary Warfare business had net negative performance
    adjustments of $263 million due principally to adjustments
    on the LHD 8 contract, cost growth and schedule delays on the
    LPD program and the effects of Hurricane Ike on a
    subcontractor’s performance.

Technical Services revenue increased
    $454 million, or 16 percent, as compared with 2009.
    The increase is primarily due to $379 million higher sales
    in the Integrated Logistics and Modernization Division (ILMD).
    The increase in ILMD is primarily due to the continued

ramp-up

of
    the recently awarded KC-10 and C-20 programs.

2009 –

Technical Services revenue increased
    $241 million, or 10 percent, as compared with 2008.
    The increase was primarily due to $245 million higher sales
    in ILMD, and $74 million higher sales in Training Solutions
    Division (TSD), partially offset by $72 million lower sales
    in Defense and Government Services Division (DGSD). The increase
    in ILMD was due to increased task orders for the CNTPO program
    and higher demand on the Hunter Contractor Logistics Support
    (CLS) programs in support of the DoD’s surge in
    Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)
    initiatives. The increase in TSD was due to higher volume on
    various training and simulation programs including the Joint
    Warfighting Center Support, Saudi Arabia National Guard
    Modernization and Training, Global Linguist Solutions, National
    Level Exercise 2009 and African Contingency Operations
    Training Assistance programs. These increases were partially
    offset by lower 2009 sales in DGSD due to the completion of the
    Joint Base Operations Support program in 2008.

Segment
    Operating Income

2010 –

Operating income at Technical Services
    increased $45 million, or 28 percent, as compared with
    2009. The increase is primarily due to the higher sales volume
    discussed above. Operating income as a percentage of sales
    increased 60 basis points and reflects improved program
    performance and business mix changes.

2009 –

Operating income at Technical Services
    increased $17 million, or 12 percent, as compared with
    2008. The increase was primarily due to the higher sales volume
    discussed above and $3 million from performance
    improvements across numerous programs.

BACKLOG

Definition

Total backlog at December 31, 2010, was approximately
    $64.2 billion. Total backlog includes both funded backlog
    (firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the
    customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding is
    not currently contractually obligated by the customer). Unfunded
    backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded
    indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) orders. For
    multi-year services contracts with non-federal government
    customers having no stated contract values, backlog includes
    only the amounts committed by the customer.

Backlog is converted into the following years’ sales as
    costs are incurred or deliveries are made. Approximately
    48 percent of the $64.2 billion total backlog at
    December 31, 2010, is expected to be converted into sales
    in 2011. Total U.S. Government orders, including those made
    on behalf of foreign governments, comprised 91 percent of
    the total backlog at the end of 2010. Total foreign customer
    orders accounted for 5 percent of the total backlog at the
    end of 2010. Domestic commercial backlog represented
    4 percent of total backlog at the end of 2010.

Backlog
    Adjustments


– A $1.1 billion reduction in backlog
    was recorded in 2010 as a result of the restructure of the
    NPOESS program at our Aerospace Systems segment.

Backlog was also impacted in 2010 by an agreement we reached
    with the Commonwealth of Virginia related to the VITA contract.
    The agreement defined minimum revenue amounts for the remaining
    years under the base contract and extended the contract for
    three additional years through 2019. We recorded a favorable
    backlog adjustment of $824 million for the definitization
    of the base contract revenues for years 2011 through 2016, while
    the contract extension and 2010 portion of the base contract
    revenues, totaling $802 million, were recorded as new
    awards in the period in our Information Systems segment.


– Total backlog in 2009 reflects a
    negative backlog adjustment of $5.8 billion for the Kinetic
    Energy Interceptor program termination for convenience at
    Aerospace Systems and the DDG 1000 program restructure at
    Shipbuilding.

New
    Awards

2010 –

The estimated value of contract awards
    included in backlog during the year ended December 31,
    2010, was $30 billion. Significant new awards during this
    period include $1.2 billion for the Global Hawk HALE
    program, $979 million for the

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating
    results into cash for deployment in growing our businesses and
    maximizing shareholder value. We actively manage our capital
    resources through working capital improvements, capital
    expenditures, strategic business acquisitions and divestitures,
    debt issuance and repayment, required and voluntary pension
    contributions, and returning cash to our shareholders through
    dividend payments and repurchases of common stock.

We use various financial measures to assist in capital
    deployment decision-making, including net cash provided by
    operations, free cash flow, net

debt-to-equity,

and net

debt-to-capital.

We believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing
    our financial performance.

The table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided
    by operating activities.

Free Cash
    Flow

Free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less
    capital expenditures and outsourcing contract and related
    software costs. Outsourcing contract and related software costs
    are similar to capital expenditures in that the contract costs
    represent incremental external costs or certain specific
    internal costs that are directly related to the contract
    acquisition and transition/set-up. These outsourcing contract
    and related software costs are deferred and expensed over the
    contract life. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure for
    investors to consider. This measure is a key factor used by
    management in our planning for and consideration of strategic
    acquisitions, stock repurchases and the payment of dividends.

Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under
    GAAP, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies
    in the same manner. This measure should not be considered in
    isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for
    discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating
    results presented in accordance with GAAP as indicators of
    performance.

Cash
    Flows

The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing
    and financing activities for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2010, as classified on the
    consolidated statements of cash flows located in Part II,
    Item 8.

Operating
    Activities


– Net cash provided by operating
    activities in 2010 increased $320 million as compared with
    2009 and reflects improved cash collections from our customers
    and lower tax payments. In 2009, net cash provided by operating
    activities included $508 million taxes paid related to the
    sale of ASD. Pension plan contributions totaled
    $894 million in 2010, of which $830 million was
    voluntarily pre-funded.

In 2011, we expect to contribute the required minimum funding
    level of approximately $62 million to our pension plans and
    approximately $160 million to our other post-retirement
    benefit plans, and also expect to make additional voluntary
    pension contributions of approximately $500 million. We
    expect cash generated from operations for 2011 to be sufficient
    to service debt and contract obligations, finance capital
    expenditures, continue acquisition of shares under the share
    repurchase program, and continue paying dividends to our
    shareholders. Although 2011 cash from operations is expected to
    be sufficient to service these obligations, we may borrow under
    credit facilities to accommodate timing differences in cash
    flows. We have a committed $2 billion revolving credit
    facility that is currently undrawn and that can be accessed on a

same-day

basis. Additionally, we believe we could access capital markets
    for debt financing for longer-term funding, under current market
    conditions, if needed.


– Net cash provided by operating
    activities in 2009 decreased $1.1 billion as compared with
    2008, reflecting higher voluntary pension contributions and
    increased income taxes paid resulting from the sale of ASD.
    Pension plan contributions totaled $858 million in 2009, of
    which $800 million was voluntary pre-funded.


– Net cash provided by operating
    activities in 2008 increased $321 million as compared with
    2007, and reflects lower income tax payments and continued trade
    working capital reductions. Pension plan contributions totaled
    $320 million in 2008, of which $200 million was
    voluntarily pre-funded, and were comparable to 2007. Net cash
    provided by operating activities for 2008 included
    $113 million of federal and state income tax refunds and
    $23 million of interest income.

Investing
    Activities


– Cash used in investing activities was
    $761 million in 2010 and reflects $770 million of
    capital expenditures, which includes $57 million of
    capitalized software costs. Capital expenditure commitments at
    December 31, 2010, were approximately $444 million,
    which are expected to be paid with cash on hand.


– Cash provided by investing activities
    was $867 million in 2009. During 2009, we received
    $1.65 billion in proceeds from the sale of ASD (see
    Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8), paid $68 million for
    outsourcing costs related to outsourcing services contracts, and
    paid $33 million to acquire Sonoma Photonics, Inc. and the
    assets from Swift Engineering’s Killer Bee Unmanned Air
    Systems product line

(see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8). Capital expenditures in 2009 were
    $654 million and included $36 million of capitalized
    software costs.


– Cash used in investing activities was
    $626 million in 2008. During 2008, we received
    $175 million in proceeds from the sale of the
    Electro-Optical Systems business, spent $92 million for the
    acquisition of 3001 International, Inc. (see Notes 5 and 6
    to the consolidated financial statements in Part II,
    Item 8), paid $110 million for outsourcing costs
    related to outsourcing services contracts, and released
    $61 million of restricted cash related to the Gulf
    Opportunity Zone Industrial Development Revenue Bonds (see
    Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8). We had $11 million in
    restricted cash as of December 31, 2008 related to the
    Xinetics Inc. purchase (see Note 5 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8). Capital
    expenditures in 2008 were $681 million and included
    $23 million of capitalized software costs.

Financing
    Activities


– Cash used in financing activities in
    2010 was $1.3 billion, which was comparable to 2009.
    Financing activities in 2010 reflect $1.2 billion in debt
    payments, including the repurchase of $682 million of
    higher coupon debt, $231 million for fees and associated
    premiums paid to the tendering holders of these debt securities,
    and the repurchase of $178 million of Shipbuilding
    indebtedness in connection with our analysis of strategic
    alternatives for that business. These financing outflows were
    offset by $1.5 billion in net proceeds from new debt
    issuances. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8. In addition, we
    repurchased $1.2 billion of our common shares outstanding
    in 2010.


– Cash used in financing activities in
    2009 was $1.2 billion compared with $2 billion in 2008
    and reflects $843 million in net proceeds from new debt
    issuance in 2009. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial
    statements in Part II, Item 8.


– Cash used in financing activities in
    2008 was $2 billion compared to $1.5 billion in 2007.
    The $532 million increase is primarily due to
    $380 million more for share repurchases and
    $171 million lower proceeds from stock option exercises.

Share Repurchases

– We repurchased
    19.7 million, 23.1 million, and 21.4 million
    shares in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. See Purchases of
    Equity Securities by Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers in
    Part II, Item 5 and Note 4 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8 for a
    discussion concerning our common stock repurchases.

Credit
    Facility

We have a revolving credit agreement, which provides for a
    five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal
    amount of $2 billion and a maturity date of August 10,
    2012. The credit facility permits us to request additional
    lending commitments from the lenders under the agreement or
    other eligible lenders under certain circumstances, and thereby
    increase the aggregate principal amount of the lending
    commitments under the agreement by up to an additional
    $500 million. Our credit agreement contains a financial
    covenant relating to a maximum debt to capitalization ratio, and
    certain restrictions on additional asset liens, unless permitted
    by the agreement. As of December 31, 2010, we were in
    compliance with all covenants.

There were no borrowings during 2010 and 2009 under this
    facility. There was no balance outstanding under this facility
    at December 31, 2010, and 2009.

Other
    Sources and Uses of Capital

Additional Capital

– We believe we can obtain
    additional capital, if necessary for long-term liquidity, from
    such sources as the public or private capital markets, the sale
    of assets, sale and leaseback of operating assets, and leasing
    rather than purchasing new assets. We have an effective shelf
    registration statement on file with the SEC.

We expect that cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus
    cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under
    credit facilities and in the capital markets, if needed, will be
    sufficient in 2011 to service debt and contract obligations,
    finance capital expenditures, pay federal, foreign, and state
    income taxes, fund required

and voluntary pension and other post retirement benefit plan
    contributions, continue acquisition of shares under the share
    repurchase program, and continue paying dividends to
    shareholders. We will continue to provide the productive
    capacity to perform our existing contracts, prepare for future
    contracts, and conduct research and development in the pursuit
    of developing opportunities.

Financial Arrangements

– In the ordinary course
    of business, we use standby letters of credit and guarantees
    issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by insurance
    companies principally to guarantee the performance on certain
    contracts and to support our self-insured workers’
    compensation plans. At December 31, 2010, there were
    $303 million of unused stand-by letters of credit,
    $192 million of bank guarantees, and $446 million of
    surety bonds outstanding.

A “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to
    purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally
    binding on us and that specifies all significant terms,
    including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed,
    minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate
    timing of the transaction. These amounts are primarily comprised
    of open purchase order commitments to vendors and subcontractors
    pertaining to funded contracts.

(2)

Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of total accrued
    workers’ compensation and environmental reserves, deferred
    compensation, and other miscellaneous liabilities, of which
    $109 million and $197 million of the environmental and
    workers’ compensation reserves, respectively, are recorded
    in other current liabilities. It excludes obligations for
    uncertain tax positions of $135 million, as the timing of
    the payments, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.

The table above also excludes estimated minimum funding
    requirements and expected voluntary contributions for retiree
    benefit plans as set forth by ERISA in relation to the
    company’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations
    totaling approximately $5.5 billion over the next five
    years: $722 million in 2011, $494 million in 2012,
    $698 million in 2013, $696 million in 2014, and
    $719 million in 2015. The company also has payments due
    under plans that are not required to be funded in advance, but
    are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. See Note 17 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rates

– We are exposed to market risk,
    primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency
    exchange rates. Financial instruments subject to interest rate
    risk include variable-rate short-term borrowings under the
    credit agreement and short-term investments. At
    December 31, 2010, substantially all outstanding borrowings
    were fixed-rate long-term debt obligations of which a
    significant portion are not callable until maturity. We have a
    modest exposure to interest rate risk resulting from an interest
    swap agreement. Our sensitivity to a 1 percent change in
    interest rates is tied to our $2 billion credit agreement,
    which had no balance outstanding at December 31, 2010, or
    2009, and to our interest rate swap agreement. See Note 14
    to the consolidated financial statements in Part II,
    Item 8.

Derivatives

– We do not hold or issue
    derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We may
    enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure
    to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2010, and
    2009, we had one interest rate swap agreement in effect. See
    Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements in
    Part II, Item 8.

Foreign Currency

– We enter into foreign
    currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange
    rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to
    suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. At
    December 31, 2010, and 2009, the amount of foreign currency
    forward contracts outstanding was not material. We do not
    consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign currency
    exchange to be material to the consolidated financial
    statements. See Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated
    financial statements in Part II, Item 8.

Item 8.  Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Northrop Grumman Corporation

Los Angeles, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of
    financial position of Northrop Grumman Corporation and
    subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
    2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 8, 2011 expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

– Northrop Grumman
    Corporation and its subsidiaries (Northrop Grumman or the
    company) provide technologically advanced, innovative products,
    services, and solutions in aerospace, electronics, information
    systems, shipbuilding and technical services. In January 2009,
    the company streamlined its organizational structure by reducing
    the number of operating segments from seven to five. The five
    segments are Aerospace Systems, Electronic Systems, Information
    Systems, Shipbuilding and Technical Services. Product sales are
    predominantly generated in the Aerospace Systems, Electronic
    Systems and Shipbuilding segments, while the majority of the
    company’s service revenues are generated by the Information
    Systems and Technical Services segments.

Aerospace Systems

is a leading developer, integrator,
    producer and supporter of manned and unmanned aircraft,
    spacecraft, high-energy laser systems, microelectronics and
    other systems and subsystems critical to maintaining the
    nation’s security and leadership in technology. These
    systems are used, primarily by U.S. Government customers,
    in many different mission areas including intelligence,
    surveillance and reconnaissance; communications; battle
    management; strike operations; electronic warfare; missile
    defense; earth observation; space science; and space exploration.

Electronic Systems

is a leader in the design,
    development, manufacture, and support of solutions for sensing,
    understanding, anticipating, and controlling the environment for
    our global military, civil, and commercial customers and their
    operations. The segment provides a variety of defense
    electronics and systems, airborne fire control radars,
    situational awareness systems, early warning systems, airspace
    management systems, navigation systems, communications systems,
    marine systems, space systems, and logistics services.

Information Systems

is a leading global provider of
    advanced solutions for Department of Defense (DoD), national
    intelligence, federal civilian, state and local agencies, and
    commercial customers. Products and services are focused on the
    fields of command, control, communications, computers and
    intelligence; air and missile defense; airborne reconnaissance;
    intelligence processing; decision support systems;
    cybersecurity; information technology; and systems engineering
    and integration.

Shipbuilding

is the nation’s sole industrial
    designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft
    carriers, the sole supplier and builder of amphibious assault
    and expeditionary warfare ships to the U.S. Navy, the sole
    builder of National Security Cutters for the U.S. Coast
    Guard, one of only two companies currently designing and
    building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy and
    one of only two companies that builds the U.S. Navy’s
    current fleet of DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers.
    Shipbuilding is also a full-service systems provider for the
    design, engineering, construction and life cycle support of
    major programs for surface ships and a provider of fleet support
    and maintenance services for the U.S. Navy.

Technical Services

is a provider of logistics,
    infrastructure, and sustainment support, while also providing a
    wide array of technical services, including training and
    simulation.

As prime contractor, principal subcontractor, partner, or
    preferred supplier, Northrop Grumman participates in many
    high-priority defense and non-defense technology programs in the
    U.S. and abroad. Northrop Grumman conducts most of its
    business with the U.S. Government, principally the DoD. The
    company is therefore affected by, among other things, the
    federal budget process. The company also conducts business with
    local, state, and foreign governments and generates domestic and
    international commercial sales.

Financial Statement Reclassification

– Certain
    amounts in the prior year financial statements and related notes
    have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation of
    the businesses described in Note 8.

Principles of Consolidation

– The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Northrop Grumman
    and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts, transactions,
    and profits among Northrop Grumman and its subsidiaries are
    eliminated in consolidation.

-67-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Accounting Estimates

– The company’s
    financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America
    (GAAP). The preparation thereof requires management to make
    estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at
    the date of the financial statements as well as the reported
    amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
    Estimates have been prepared on the basis of the most current
    and best available information and actual results could differ
    materially from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

– The majority of the
    company’s business is derived from long-term contracts for
    production of goods, and services provided to the federal
    government. In accounting for these contracts, the company
    extensively utilizes the

cost-to-cost

and the

units-of-delivery

measures of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting. Sales under cost-reimbursement contracts
    and construction-type contracts that provide for delivery at a
    low volume per year or a small number of units after a lengthy
    period of time over which a significant amount of costs have
    been incurred are accounted for using the

cost-to-cost

method. Under this method, sales, including estimated earned
    fees or profits, are recorded as costs are incurred. For most
    contracts, sales are calculated based on the percentage that
    total costs incurred bear to total estimated costs at
    completion. For certain contracts with large up-front purchases
    of material, primarily in the Shipbuilding segment, sales are
    calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs
    incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs. Sales under
    construction-type contracts that provide for delivery at a high
    volume per year are accounted for using the

units-of-delivery

method. Under this method, sales are recognized as deliveries
    are made to the customer generally using unit sales values for
    delivered units in accordance with the contract terms. The
    company estimates profit as the difference between total
    estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and
    recognizes that profit over the life of the contract based on
    deliveries or as computed on the basis of the estimated final
    average unit costs plus profit. The company classifies contract
    revenues as product sales or service revenues depending upon the
    predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts.

Certain contracts contain provisions for price redetermination
    or for cost

and/or

performance incentives. Such redetermined amounts or incentives
    are included in sales when the amounts can reasonably be
    determined and estimated. Amounts representing contract change
    orders, claims, requests for equitable adjustment, or
    limitations in funding are included in sales only when they can
    be reliably estimated and realization is probable.

In
    the period in which it is determined that a loss will result
    from the performance of a contract, the entire amount of the
    estimated ultimate loss is charged against income. Loss
    provisions are first offset against costs that are included in
    unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried costs, with any
    remaining amount reflected in liabilities.

Changes
    in estimates of contract sales, costs, and profits are
    recognized using the cumulative

catch-up

method of accounting. This method recognizes in the current
    period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior
    periods. Hence, the effect of the changes on future periods of
    contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate
    had been used since contract inception. A significant change in
    an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material
    effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or
    results of operations, and where such changes occur, separate
    disclosure is made of the nature, underlying conditions and
    financial impact of the change.

Revenue under contracts to provide services to non-federal
    government customers are generally recognized when services are
    performed. Service contracts include operations and maintenance
    contracts, and outsourcing-type arrangements, primarily in the
    Technical Services and Information Systems segments. Revenue
    under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight-line
    basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence
    suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are
    fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs incurred under these
    service contracts are expensed as incurred, except that direct
    and incremental

set-up

costs
    are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement
    (see

Outsourcing Contract Costs

below). Operating profit
    related to such service contracts may fluctuate from period to
    period, particularly in the earlier phases of the contract.

For
    contracts that include more than one type of product or service,
    revenue recognition includes the proper identification of
    separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue
    across all elements based on relative fair values.

    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

General and Administrative Expenses

– In
    accordance with industry practice and the regulations that
    govern the cost accounting requirements for government
    contracts, most general corporate expenses incurred at both the
    segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and
    allocable costs on government contracts. For most components of
    the company, these costs are allocated to contracts in progress
    on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include
    this cost component as an element of cost. General and
    administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations.

Research and Development

– Company-sponsored
    research and development activities primarily include
    independent research and development (IR&D) efforts related
    to government programs. IR&D expenses are included in
    general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated
    to government contracts. Company-sponsored IR&D expenses
    totaled $603 million, $610 million, and
    $564 million, in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
    Expenses for research and development sponsored by the customer
    are charged directly to the related contracts.

Restructuring Costs

– In accordance with the
    regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for
    government contracts, certain costs incurred for consolidation
    or restructuring activities that demonstrate savings in excess
    of the cost to implement those actions can be deferred and
    amortized as allowable and allocable costs on government
    contracts. Such deferred costs are not expected to have a
    material to the company’s consolidated financial position
    or results of operations (see Note 7).

Product Warranty Costs

– The company provides
    certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of
    non-conforming items for a specified period of time often
    subject to a specified monetary coverage limit. Substantially
    all of the company’s product warranties are provided under
    government contracts, the costs of which are immaterial and are
    accounted for using the

percentage-of-

completion method of accounting. Accrued product warranty costs
    for the remainder of our products (which are almost entirely
    commercial products) are not material.

Environmental Costs

– Environmental liabilities
    are accrued when the company determines such amounts are
    reasonably estimable, and management has determined that it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred. When only a range
    of amounts is established and no amount within the range is more
    probable than another, the minimum amount in the range is
    recorded. Environmental liabilities are recorded on an
    undiscounted basis. At sites involving multiple parties, the
    company accrues environmental liabilities based upon its
    expected share of liability, taking into account the financial
    viability of other jointly liable parties. Environmental
    expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
    Capitalized expenditures relate to long-lived improvements in
    currently operating facilities. The company does not anticipate
    and record insurance recoveries before collection is probable.
    At December 31, 2010, and 2009, the company did not have
    any accrued receivables related to insurance reimbursements.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

– The
    company utilizes fair value measurement guidance prescribed by
    GAAP to value its financial instruments. The guidance includes a
    definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair
    value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs
    used to measure fair value and expands disclosures about the use
    of fair value measurements.

The valuation techniques utilized are based upon observable and
    unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data
    obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs
    reflect internal market assumptions. These two types of inputs
    create the following fair value hierarchy:

Level 1 –  Quoted prices for identical
    instruments in active markets.

Level 2 –  Quoted prices for similar instruments
    in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
    instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived
    valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant
    value drivers are observable.

Level 3 –  Significant inputs to the valuation
    model are unobservable.

Derivative Financial Instruments

– Derivative
    financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in
    the financial statements and measured at fair value. Changes in
    the fair value of derivative financial instruments that qualify
    and are designated as fair value hedges are required to be
    recorded in income from continuing operations, while the
    effective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivative
    financial instruments that qualify and are designated as cash
    flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income. The
    company may use derivative financial instruments to manage its
    exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks
    and to balance its fixed and variable rate long-term debt
    portfolio. The company does not use derivative financial
    instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor does it use
    leveraged financial instruments. Credit risk related to
    derivative financial instruments is considered minimal and is
    managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties
    and through periodic settlements of positions.

For derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging
    instruments, gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair
    value are reported in Other, net in the consolidated statements
    of operations.

Income Taxes

– Provisions for federal, foreign,
    state, and local income taxes are calculated on reported
    financial statement pre-tax income based on current tax law and
    include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from
    those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and
    liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently
    payable because certain items of income and expense are
    recognized in different time periods for financial reporting
    purposes than for income tax purposes. If a tax position does
    not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of
    penalties, the company recognizes an expense for the amount of
    the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed in the tax
    return of the company. The company recognizes interest accrued
    related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
    Penalties, if probable and reasonably estimable, are recognized
    as a component of income tax expense. State and local income and
    franchise tax provisions are allocable to contracts in process
    and, accordingly, are included in general and administrative
    expenses.

The company makes a comprehensive review of its portfolio of
    uncertain tax positions regularly. In this regard, an uncertain
    tax position represents the company’s expected treatment of
    a tax position taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be
    taken in a future tax return or claim, that has not been
    reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial
    reporting purposes. Until these positions are sustained by the
    taxing authorities, the company does not recognize the tax
    benefits resulting from such positions and reports the tax
    effects as a liability for uncertain tax positions in its
    consolidated statements of financial position.

Cash and cash equivalents

– For cash and cash
    equivalents, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to
    the short-term nature of these items. Cash and cash equivalents
    include short-term interest-earning debt instruments that mature
    in three months or less from the date purchased.

Marketable Securities

– At December 31,
    2010, and 2009, substantially all of the company’s
    investments in marketable securities were classified as

available-for-sale

or trading. For

available-for-sale

securities, any unrealized gains and losses are reported as a
    separate component of shareholders’ equity. Unrealized
    gains and losses on trading securities are included in Other,
    net in the consolidated statements of operations. Investments in
    marketable securities are recorded at fair value.

Accounts Receivable

– Accounts receivable
    include amounts billed and currently due from customers, amounts
    currently due but unbilled (primarily related to contracts
    accounted for under the

cost-to-cost

measure of the

percentage-of-completion

method of accounting), certain estimated contract change
    amounts, claims or requests for equitable adjustment in
    negotiation that are probable of recovery, and amounts retained
    by the customer pending contract completion.

Inventoried Costs

– Inventoried costs primarily
    relate to work in process under fixed-price,

units-of-delivery

and fixed-priced-incentive contracts using labor dollars as the
    basis of the

percentage-of-completion

calculation. These costs represent accumulated contract costs
    less the portion of such costs allocated to delivered items.
    Accumulated contract costs include direct production costs,
    factory and engineering overhead, production

-70-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

tooling costs, and, for government contracts, allowable general
    and administrative expenses. According to the provisions of
    U.S. Government contracts, the customer asserts title to,
    or a security interest in, inventories related to such contracts
    as a result of contract advances, performance-based payments,
    and progress payments. In accordance with industry practice,
    inventoried costs are classified as a current asset and include
    amounts related to contracts having production cycles longer
    than one year.

Product
    inventory primarily consists of raw materials and is stated at
    the lower of cost or market, generally using the average cost
    method.

General
    corporate expenses and IR&D allocable to commercial
    contracts are expensed as incurred.

Outsourcing Contract Costs

– Costs on
    outsourcing contracts, including costs incurred for bid and
    proposal activities, are generally expensed as incurred.
    However, certain costs incurred upon initiation of an
    outsourcing contract are deferred and expensed over the contract
    life. These costs represent incremental external costs or
    certain specific internal costs that are directly related to the
    contract acquisition and transition/set-up. The primary types of
    costs that may be capitalized include labor and related fringe
    benefits, subcontractor costs, and travel costs. The company
    capitalized $4 million, $57 million, and
    $111 million and amortized $39 million,
    $46 million, and $52 million of such costs in 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010, and
    2009, respectively, deferred outsourcing contract costs of
    $239 million and $274 million were included in
    miscellaneous other assets.

Depreciable Properties

– Property, plant, and
    equipment owned by the company are depreciated over the
    estimated useful lives of individual assets. Most of these
    assets are depreciated using declining-balance methods, with the
    remainder using the straight-line method, with the following
    lives:

Years

Land improvements

2-45

Buildings and improvements

2-45

Machinery and other equipment

2-25

Capitalized software costs

3-5

Leasehold improvements

Length of lease

Leases

– The company uses its incremental
    borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification as
    capital or operating and defines the initial lease term to
    include renewal options determined to be reasonably assured. The
    company conducts operations primarily under operating leases.

Many of the company’s real property lease agreements
    contain incentives for tenant improvements, rent holidays, or
    rent escalation clauses. For tenant improvement incentives, the
    company records a deferred rent liability and amortizes the
    deferred rent over the term of the lease as a reduction to rent
    expense. For rent holidays and rent escalation clauses during
    the lease term, the company records minimum rental expenses on a
    straight-line basis over the term of the lease. For purposes of
    recognizing lease incentives, the company uses the date of
    initial possession as the commencement date, which is generally
    when the company is given the right of access to the space and
    begins to make improvements in preparation of intended use.

Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangible
    Assets

– The company performs impairment tests for
    goodwill as of November 30th of each year, or when
    evidence of potential impairment exists. When it is determined
    that impairment has occurred, a charge to operations is
    recorded. Goodwill and other purchased intangible asset balances
    are included in the identifiable assets of the business segment
    to which they have been assigned. Any goodwill impairment, as
    well as the amortization of other purchased intangible assets,
    is charged against the respective business segments’
    operating income. Purchased intangible assets are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (see
    Note 12).

Self-Insurance Accruals

– Accruals for
    self-insured workers’ compensation totaling approximately
    $549 million and $520 million as of December 31,
    2010, and 2009, respectively are included in other current
    liabilities and other long-term liabilities. The company
    estimates the required liability for such claims on a discounted
    basis utilizing

-71-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

actuarial methods based on various assumptions, which include,
    but are not limited to, the company’s historical loss
    experience and projected loss development factors.

Litigation, Commitments, and Contingencies

–
    Amounts associated with litigation, commitments, and
    contingencies are recorded as charges to earnings when
    management, after taking into consideration the facts and
    circumstances of each matter, including any settlement offers,
    has determined that it is probable that a liability has been
    incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

Retirement Benefits

– The company sponsors
    various pension plans covering substantially all employees. The
    company also provides post-retirement benefit plans other than
    pensions, consisting principally of health care and life
    insurance benefits, to eligible retirees and qualifying
    dependents. The liabilities, unamortized benefit plan costs and
    annual income or expense of the company’s pension and other
    post-retirement benefit plans are determined using methodologies
    that involve several actuarial assumptions, the most significant
    of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset
    return (based on the market-related value of assets), and the
    medical cost experience trend rate (rate of growth for medical
    costs). Unamortized benefit plan costs consist primarily of
    accumulated net after-tax actuarial losses. Net actuarial gains
    or losses are re-determined annually and principally arise from
    gains or losses on plan assets due to variations in the fair
    market value of the underlying assets and changes in the benefit
    obligation due to changes in actuarial assumptions. Net
    actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense in future
    periods when they exceed ten percent of the greater of the plan
    assets or projected benefit obligations by benefit plan. The
    excess of gains or losses over the ten percent threshold are
    subject to amortization over the average future service period
    of employees of approximately ten years. The fair values of plan
    assets are determined based on prevailing market prices or
    estimated fair value for investments with no available quoted
    prices. Not all net periodic pension income or expense is
    recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is
    allocated to production as product costs, and a portion remains
    in inventory at the end of a reporting period. The
    company’s funding policy for pension plans is to
    contribute, at a minimum, the statutorily required amount to an
    irrevocable trust.

Stock Compensation

– All of the company’s
    stock compensation plans are considered equity plans, and
    compensation expense recognized is net of estimated forfeitures
    over the vesting period. The company issues stock options and
    stock awards, in the form of restricted performance stock rights
    and restricted stock rights, under its existing plans. The fair
    value of stock option grants are estimated on the date of grant
    using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model and expensed on a
    straight-line basis over the vesting period of the options,
    which is generally three to four years. The fair value of stock
    awards is determined based on the closing market price of the
    company’s common stock on the grant date and at each
    reporting date the number of shares is adjusted to equal the
    number ultimately expected to vest. Compensation expense for
    stock awards is expensed over the vesting period, usually three
    to five years.

Foreign Currency Translation

– For operations
    outside the U.S. that prepare financial statements in
    currencies other than the U.S. dollar, results of
    operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange
    rates during the period, and assets and liabilities are
    generally translated at

end-of-period

exchange rates. Translation adjustments are included as a
    separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in
    consolidated shareholders’ equity.

DIVIDENDS
    ON COMMON STOCK AND CONVERSION OF PREFERRED STOCK

Dividends on Common Stock

– In May 2010, the
    company’s board of directors approved an increase to the
    quarterly common stock dividend, from $0.43 per share to $0.47
    per share, for stockholders of record as of June 1, 2010.

In May 2009, the company’s board of directors approved an
    increase to the quarterly common stock dividend, from $0.40 per
    share to $0.43 per share, for stockholders of record as of
    June 1, 2009.

In April 2008, the company’s board of directors approved an
    increase to the quarterly common stock dividend, from $0.37 per
    share to $0.40 per share, for stockholders of record as of
    June 2, 2008.

Conversion of Preferred Stock

– On
    February 20, 2008, the company’s board of directors
    approved the redemption of the 3.5 million shares of
    mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock on
    April 4, 2008. Prior to the redemption date, substantially
    all of the preferred shares were converted into common stock at
    the election of stockholders. All remaining unconverted
    preferred shares were redeemed by the company on the redemption
    date. As a result of the conversion and redemption, the company
    issued approximately 6.4 million shares of common stock.

4.

EARNINGS
    (LOSS) PER SHARE

Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share

– Basic
    earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations are
    calculated by dividing earnings (loss) from continuing
    operations available to common stockholders by the
    weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
    during each period.

Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share

– Diluted
    earnings per share include the dilutive effect of stock options
    and other stock awards granted to employees under stock-based
    compensation plans. The dilutive effect of these securities
    totaled 4.2 million and 4.1 million shares for the
    year ended December 31, 2010, and 2009. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the potential dilutive effect of
    7.1 million shares from these securities and the
    mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock (see
    Note 3) were excluded from the computation of
    weighted-average dilutive shares outstanding as the shares would
    have had an anti-dilutive effect on the loss per share
    computation.

The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, exclude
    anti-dilutive stock options to purchase approximately
    2.8 million shares, 8.1 million shares, and
    2.1 million shares, respectively, because such options have
    exercise prices in excess of the average market price of the
    company’s common stock during the year.

BUSINESS
    DISPOSITIONS


– In December 2009, the company sold ASD
    for $1.65 billion in cash to an investor group led by
    General Atlantic, LLC, and affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis
    Roberts & Co. L.P., and recognized a gain of
    $15 million, net of taxes. ASD was a business unit
    comprised of the assets and liabilities of TASC, Inc., its
    wholly-owned subsidiary TASC Services Corporation, and certain
    contracts carved out from other Northrop Grumman businesses also
    in Information Systems that provide systems engineering
    technical assistance (SETA) and other analysis and advisory
    services. Sales for this business in the years ended
    December 31, 2009, and 2008, were approximately
    $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion, respectively. The
    assets, liabilities and operating results of this business unit
    are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated
    statements of operations for all periods presented.


– In April 2008, the company sold its
    Electro-Optical Systems (EOS) business for $175 million in
    cash to L-3 Communications Corporation and recognized a gain of
    $19 million, net of taxes. EOS, formerly a part of the
    Electronic Systems segment, produces night vision and applied
    optics products. Sales for this business through April 2008 were
    approximately $53 million. The assets, liabilities and
    operating results of this business are reported as discontinued
    operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all
    periods presented.

SHIPBUILDING
    STRATEGIC ACTIONS

In July 2010, the company announced plans to consolidate its
    Gulf Coast shipbuilding operations by winding down its
    shipbuilding operations at the Avondale, Louisiana facility in
    2013 after completing the LPD-class ships currently under
    construction there. Future LPD-class ships will be built in a
    single production line at the company’s Pascagoula,
    Mississippi facility. The consolidation is intended to reduce
    costs, increase efficiency, and address shipbuilding
    overcapacity. Due to the consolidation, the company expects
    higher costs to complete ships currently under construction in
    Avondale due to anticipated reductions in productivity and
    increased the estimates to complete LPDs 23 and 25 by
    approximately $210 million. The company recognized a
    $113 million pre-tax charge to Shipbuilding’s
    operating income for these contracts during the second quarter
    of 2010. The company is currently exploring alternative uses of
    the Avondale facility by potential new owners, including
    alternative opportunities for the workforce there.

In addition, the company anticipates that it will incur
    substantial restructuring and facilities shutdown-related costs,
    including, but not limited to, severance, relocation expense,
    and asset write-downs related to the Avondale facility decision.
    These costs are expected to be allowable expenses under
    government accounting standards and are expected to be
    recoverable in future years’ overhead costs. These future
    costs could approximate $310 million and such costs should
    be allocable to existing flexibly priced contracts or future
    negotiated contracts at the Gulf Coast operations in accordance
    with FAR provisions relating to the treatment of restructuring
    and shutdown related costs.

In its initial audit report on the company’s cost proposal
    for the restructuring and shutdown related costs, the Defense
    Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) stated that, in general, the
    proposal was not adequately supported in order for them to reach
    a conclusion. They also questioned approximately ten percent of
    the costs submitted and did not accept the cost proposal as
    submitted. The company intends to resubmit its proposal to
    address the concerns expressed by the DCAA.  Ultimately, the
    company anticipates that this process will result in an
    agreement with the U.S. Navy that is substantially in
    accord with management’s cost allowability expectations.
    Accordingly, the company has treated these costs as allowable
    costs in determining the cost and earnings performance on
    Shipbuilding’s contracts in process. If there is a formal
    challenge to the company’s treatment of its restructuring
    costs, there are prescribed dispute resolution alternatives to
    resolve such a challenge and the company would likely pursue a
    dispute resolution process.

The company also announced in July 2010 that it would evaluate
    whether a separation of the Shipbuilding segment would be in the
    best interests of shareholders, customers, and employees by
    allowing both the company and the Shipbuilding segment to more
    effectively pursue their respective opportunities to maximize
    long-term

    include, but are not limited to, a spin-off to the
    company’s shareholders. While the company continues its
    evaluation of strategic alternatives for the Shipbuilding
    segment, it will continue to be reported in continuing
    operations.

In preparation for an anticipated spin-off to the company’s
    shareholders, a registration statement on Form 10 for the
    shares of Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII or the
    Shipbuilding business) was initially filed with the SEC in
    October 2010, with amendments filed in November 2010, December
    2010 and January 2011. Additionally, in connection with, and
    prior to, the anticipated spin-off, the company repurchased
    $178 million of the Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial
    Revenue Development Bonds (see Note 14).

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

At December 31, 2010, the company was aligned into five
    reportable segments: Aerospace Systems, Electronic Systems,
    Information Systems, Shipbuilding, and Technical Services.

The company, from time to time, acquires or disposes of
    businesses, and realigns contracts, programs or business areas
    among and within its operating segments that possess similar
    customers, expertise, and capabilities. Internal realignments
    are designed to more fully leverage existing capabilities and
    enhance development and delivery of products and services.

Segment Realignments –

In January 2010, the
    company transferred its internal information technology services
    unit from the Information Systems segment to the company’s
    corporate shared services group. The intersegment sales and
    operating income for this unit that were previously recognized
    in the Information Systems segment are immaterial and have been
    eliminated for all periods presented.

In January 2009, the company streamlined its organizational
    structure by reducing the number of operating segments from
    seven to five. The five segments are Aerospace Systems, which
    combines the former Integrated Systems and Space Technology
    segments; Electronic Systems; Information Systems, which
    combines the former Information Technology and Mission Systems
    segments; Shipbuilding; and Technical Services. Creation of the
    Aerospace Systems and Information Systems segments is intended
    to strengthen alignment with customers, improve the
    company’s ability to execute on programs and win new
    business, and enhance cost competitiveness. Product sales are
    predominantly generated in the Aerospace Systems, Electronic
    Systems and Shipbuilding segments, while the majority of the
    company’s service revenues are generated by the Information
    Systems and Technical Services segments.

During the first quarter of 2009, the company realigned certain
    logistics, services, and technical support programs and
    transferred assets from the Information Systems and Electronic
    Systems segments to the Technical Services segment. This
    realignment is intended to strengthen the company’s core
    capability in aircraft and electronics maintenance, repair and
    overhaul, life cycle optimization, and training and simulation
    services.

Sales and segment operating income in the tables below have been
    revised to reflect the above realignments for all periods
    presented.

During the first quarter of 2009, the company transferred
    certain optics and laser programs from the Information Systems
    segment to the Aerospace Systems segment. As the operating
    results of this business were not considered material, the prior
    year sales and segment operating income were not reclassified to
    reflect this business transfer.

U.S. Government Sales –

Revenue from the
    U.S. Government (which includes Foreign Military Sales)
    includes revenue from contracts for which Northrop Grumman is
    the prime contractor as well as those for which the company is a
    subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the
    U.S. Government. All of the company’s segments derive
    substantial revenue from the U.S. Government. Sales to the
    U.S. Government amounted to approximately
    $32.1 billion, $31.0 billion, and $29.3 billion,
    or 92.3 percent, 91.8 percent, and 90.7 percent,
    of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009, and 2008, respectively.

    to approximately $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and
    $1.7 billion, or 4.6 percent, 4.9 percent, and
    5.3 percent of total revenue for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

The company’s
    discontinued operations are excluded from all of the data
    elements in the following tables, except for assets by segment.

Goodwill Impairment Charge –

The total segment
    operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    reflects goodwill impairment charges of $570 million and
    $2,490 million, at Aerospace Systems and Shipbuilding,
    respectively. The impairment charge was primarily due to adverse
    equity market conditions that caused a decrease in market
    multiples and the company’s stock price.

Shipbuilding Earnings Charges

– In 2010, the
    company recorded a pre-tax charge of $113 million related
    to the consolidation of the company’s Gulf Coast facilities
    (see Note 7). In 2008, the company recorded a pre-tax
    charge of $272 million for cost growth on the LHD 8
    contract and an additional $54 million primarily for
    schedule impacts on other ships and impairment of purchased
    intangibles at the Gulf Coast shipyards.

Unallocated Corporate Expenses –

Unallocated
    corporate expenses generally include the portion of corporate
    expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable
    U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) regulations
    and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and therefore not
    allocated to the segments,

-77-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

for costs related to management and administration, legal,
    environmental, certain compensation and retiree benefits, and
    other expenses.

Net Pension Adjustment –

The net pension
    adjustment reflects the difference between pension expense
    determined in accordance with GAAP and pension expense allocated
    to the operating segments determined in accordance with CAS.

Royalty Income Adjustment –

Royalty income is
    included in segment operating income and reclassified to other
    income for financial reporting purposes. The royalty income
    adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2008, includes
    $60 million related to patent infringement settlements at
    Electronic Systems.

Intersegment
    Sales and Margin

To encourage commerce between operating units, sales between
    segments are recorded at values that include a hypothetical
    margin for the performing segment based on that segment’s
    estimated margin rate for external sales. Such hypothetical
    margins are eliminated in consolidation. Intersegment sales and
    operating income were as follows:

ACCOUNTS
    RECEIVABLE, NET

Unbilled amounts represent sales for which billings have not
    been presented to customers at year-end. These amounts are
    usually billed and collected within one year. Progress payments
    are received on a number of firm fixed-price contracts. Unbilled
    amounts are presented net of progress payments of
    $6.4 billion and $5.6 billion at December 31,
    2010, and 2009, respectively.

Accounts receivable at December 31, 2010, are expected to
    be collected in 2011, except for approximately $133 million
    due in 2012 and $29 million due in 2013 and later.

The company does not believe it has significant exposure to
    credit risk as accounts receivable and the related unbilled
    amounts are primarily due from the U.S. Government. The
    company applied the GAAP guidance related to

“Accounts
    Receivable – Credit Quality of Financing
    Receivables”

on a prospective basis. Accordingly,
    accruals for potential overhead rate adjustments and other costs
    that were previously reported as an allowance for doubtful
    amounts have been reclassified to other current liabilities at
    December 31, 2010.

INCOME
    TAXES

The company’s effective tax rate on earnings from
    continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010
    was 21.5 percent, as compared with 30.6 percent and
    33.8 percent in 2009 and 2008, respectively (excluding for
    2008 the non-cash, non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of
    $3.1 billion at Aerospace Systems and Shipbuilding). The
    company’s effective tax rates reflect tax credits,
    manufacturing deductions and the impact of settlements with the
    Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

In 2010, the company received final approval from the IRS and
    the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation (Joint
    Committee) of the IRS’ examination of the company’s
    tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006. As a result of the
    settlement, the company recognized net tax benefits of
    approximately $296 million (of which $66 million was
    in cash), which were recorded as a reduction to the
    company’s provision for income taxes.

During 2009, the company reached a final settlement with the IRS
    regarding its audit of the company’s tax returns for the
    years ended December 31, 2001 through 2003 and recognized
    $75 million of net benefit upon settlement, including
    $20 million of interest. During 2008, the company reached a
    final settlement with the IRS regarding its audit of the TRW tax
    returns for the years ended 1999 through 2002 and recognized
    $35 million of benefit upon settlement, including
    $4 million of interest.

Uncertain Tax Positions

– In 2010, the company
    reached a final settlement with the IRS and Joint Committee with
    respect to the IRS’ examination of the company’s tax
    returns for the years 2004 through 2006. As a result of this
    settlement, the company reduced its liability for uncertain tax
    positions, including previously accrued interest, by
    $311 million, which was recorded as a reduction to the
    company’s effective tax rate.

In 2009, the company reached a final settlement agreement with
    the IRS and Joint Committee with respect to the IRS’
    examination of the company’s tax returns for the years 2001
    through 2003. As a result of this settlement, the company
    reduced its liability for uncertain tax positions by
    $60 million, which was recorded as a reduction to the
    company’s effective tax rate.

In 2008, the company reached a final settlement agreement with
    the IRS and Joint Committee with respect to the IRS’ audit
    of the TRW tax returns for the years 1999 through 2002. As a
    result of this settlement, the company reduced its liability for
    uncertain tax positions by $126 million (including accrued
    interest of $44 million), $95 million of which was
    recorded as a reduction of goodwill.

-81-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

As of December 31, 2010, the estimated value of the
    company’s uncertain tax positions which are
    more-likely-than-not to be sustained on examination was a
    liability of $137 million which includes accrued interest
    of $11 million. This liability is included in other current
    liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated
    statements of financial position. Assuming sustainment of these
    positions by the taxing authorities, the reversal of the amounts
    accrued would reduce the company’s effective tax rate.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

– Unrecognized tax
    benefits represent the gross value of the company’s tax
    positions that have not been reflected in the consolidated
    statements of operations and includes the value of the
    company’s recorded uncertain tax positions. If the income
    tax benefits from these tax positions are ultimately realized,
    such realization would affect the company’s effective tax
    rate.

The change in unrecognized tax benefits during 2010 and 2009,
    excluding interest, is as follows:

Although the company believes that it has adequately provided
    for all of its tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing
    authorities in future years could be greater than the
    company’s accrued positions. Accordingly, additional
    provisions on income tax related matters could be recorded in
    the future due to revised estimates, settlement or other
    resolution of the underlying tax matters. In addition, open tax
    years related to state and foreign jurisdictions remain subject
    to examination but are not considered material. The IRS is
    currently conducting an examination of the company’s tax
    returns for the years 2007 through 2009.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008,
    the company recorded approximately $88 million,
    $6 million, and $(29) million of net interest income
    (expense), respectively, within its federal and foreign, and
    state income tax provisions.

Deferred Income Taxes

– Deferred income taxes
    reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
    carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
    reporting purposes and tax purposes. Such amounts are classified
    in the consolidated statements of financial position as current
    or noncurrent assets or liabilities based upon the
    classification of the related assets and liabilities.

Foreign Income

– As of December 31, 2010,
    the company had approximately $668 million of accumulated
    undistributed earnings generated by its foreign subsidiaries. No
    deferred tax liability has been recorded on these earnings since
    the company intends to permanently reinvest these earnings,
    thereby indefinitely postponing their remittance. Should these
    earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise,
    the distributions would be subject to U.S. federal income
    tax at the statutory rate of 35 percent, less foreign tax
    credits available to offset such distributions, if any. In
    addition, such distributions would be subject to withholding
    taxes in the various tax jurisdictions.

GOODWILL
    AND OTHER PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill

Goodwill and other purchased intangible assets are included in
    the identifiable assets of the segment to which they have been
    assigned. Impairment tests are performed at least annually and
    more often as circumstances require. Any goodwill impairment, as
    well as the amortization of other purchased intangible assets,
    is charged against the respective segment’s operating
    income. The annual impairment test for all segments was
    performed as of November 30, 2010, with no indication of
    impairment. In performing the goodwill impairment tests, the
    company uses a discounted cash flow approach corroborated by
    comparative market multiples, where appropriate, to determine
    the fair value of its businesses. Accumulated goodwill
    impairment losses at December 31, 2010, and

Segment Realignments

– As discussed in
    Note 8, in January 2009, the company realigned certain
    logistics, services, and technical support programs and
    transferred assets from the Information Systems and Electronic
    Systems segments to the Technical Services segment. As a result
    of this realignment, goodwill of approximately $123 million
    was reallocated among these segments. Additionally during the
    first quarter of 2009, the company transferred certain optics
    and laser programs from the Information Systems segment to the
    Aerospace Systems segment, resulting in the reallocation of
    goodwill of approximately $41 million.

    Aggregate amortization expense for 2010, 2009, and 2008, was
    $94 million, $104 million, and $136 million,
    respectively. The 2008 amount includes a $19 million
    impairment of purchased intangibles recorded in the first
    quarter of 2008 associated with the LHD 8 and other Gulf Coast
    shipbuilding programs.

FAIR
    VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Investments in Marketable Securities

– The
    company holds a portfolio of marketable securities, primarily
    consisting of equity securities that are classified as either
    trading or

available-for-sale

and can be liquidated without restriction. These assets are
    recorded at fair value, substantially all of which are based
    upon quoted market prices for identical instruments in active
    markets (Level 1 inputs). As of December 31, 2010, and
    2009, respectively, there were marketable equity securities of
    $68 million and $58 million included in prepaid
    expenses and other current assets and $262 million and
    $233 million of marketable equity securities included in
    miscellaneous other assets in the consolidated statements of
    financial position.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

– The company utilizes derivative
    financial instruments in order to manage exposure to interest
    rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The company
    does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or
    speculative purposes, nor does it use leveraged financial
    instruments. Interest rate swap agreements utilize floating
    interest rates as an offset to the fixed-rate characteristics of
    certain long-term debt instruments. Foreign currency forward
    contracts are used to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk
    related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers
    denominated in foreign currencies.

Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or
    liabilities in the financial statements and measured at fair
    value, substantially all of which are based on active or
    inactive markets for identical of similar instruments or
    model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable
    (Level 2 inputs). Where model-derived valuations are
    appropriate, the company utilizes the income approach to
    determine fair value and uses the applicable London Interbank
    Offered Rate (LIBOR) swap rate as the discount rate. Changes in
    the fair value of derivative financial instruments that qualify
    and are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings
    from continuing operations, while the effective portion of the
    changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments
    that qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded
    in other comprehensive income. Credit risk related to derivative
    financial instruments is considered minimal and is managed by
    requiring high credit standards for counterparties and through
    periodic settlements of positions.

For derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging
    instruments as well as the ineffective portion of cash flow
    hedges, gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value
    are reported in Other, net in the consolidated statements of
    operations. Unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges are
    reclassified from other comprehensive income to earnings from
    continuing operations upon the recognition of the underlying
    transactions.

As of December 31, 2010, an interest rate swap with a
    notional value of $200 million, and foreign currency
    purchase and sale forward contract agreements with notional
    values of $52 million and $86 million, respectively,
    were designated for hedge accounting. The remaining notional
    values outstanding at December 31, 2010, under foreign
    currency purchase and sale forward contracts of $12 million
    and $75 million, respectively, were not designated for
    hedge accounting.

As of December 31, 2009, an interest rate swap with a
    notional value of $200 million, and foreign currency
    purchase and sale forward contract agreements with notional
    values of $77 million and $151 million, respectively,
    were designated as hedging instruments. The remaining notional
    values outstanding at December 31, 2009, under foreign
    currency purchase and sale forward contracts of $19 million
    and $74 million, respectively, were not designated for
    hedge accounting.

The derivative fair values and related unrealized gains and
    losses at December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009,
    were not material.

There were no material transfers of financial instruments
    between the three levels of fair value hierarchy during the year
    ended December 31, 2010.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance
    Policies

– The company maintains whole life
    insurance policies on a group of executives which are recorded
    at their cash surrender value as determined by the insurance
    carrier. Additionally, the company has split-dollar life
    insurance policies on former officers and executives from
    acquired businesses which are recorded at the lesser of their
    cash surrender value or premiums paid. The policies are utilized
    as a partial funding source for deferred compensation and other
    non-qualified employee retirement plans. As of December 31,
    2010, and 2009, the carrying values associated with these
    policies of $257 million and $242 million,
    respectively, were recorded in miscellaneous other assets.

Long-Term Debt

– As of December 31, 2010,
    and 2009, the carrying values of long-term debt were
    $4.8 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, and the
    related estimated fair values were $5.2 billion and
    $4.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of long-term
    debt was calculated based on interest rates available for debt
    with terms and maturities similar to the company’s existing
    debt arrangements.

The carrying amounts of all other financial instruments not
    discussed above approximate fair value due to their short-term
    nature.

NOTES PAYABLE
    TO BANKS AND LONG-TERM DEBT

Lines of Credit

– The company has available
    uncommitted short-term credit lines in the form of money market
    facilities with several banks. The amount and conditions for
    borrowing under these credit lines depend on the availability
    and terms prevailing in the marketplace. No fees or compensating
    balances are required for these credit facilities.

Credit Facility

– The company has a revolving
    credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of
    $2 billion that matures on August 10, 2012. The credit
    facility permits the company to request additional lending
    commitments of up to $500 million from the lenders under
    the agreement or through other eligible lenders under certain
    circumstances. The agreement provides for swingline loans and
    letters of credit as

sub-facilities

for the credit facilities provided for in the agreement.
    Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at various
    rates, including the London Interbank Offered Rate, adjusted
    based on the company’s credit rating, or an alternate base
    rate plus an incremental margin. The credit facility also
    requires a facility fee based on the daily aggregate amount of
    commitments (whether or not utilized) and the company’s
    credit rating level, and contains a financial covenant relating
    to a maximum debt to capitalization ratio, and certain
    restrictions on additional asset liens. There were no borrowings
    during 2010 and 2009. There was no balance outstanding under
    this facility at December 31, 2010, and 2009. As of
    December 31, 2010, the company was in compliance with all
    covenants.

Debt Tender Offers

– In November 2010, the
    company made a tender offer for approximately $1.9 billion
    of debt securities held by its subsidiary Northrop Grumman
    Systems Corporation and maturing in 2016 to 2036 with interest
    rates ranging from 6.98 percent to 7.875 percent.
    Approximately $682 million in aggregate principal amount
    was purchased for a total price of $919 million (including
    accrued and unpaid interest on the securities). The company also
    recorded a pre-tax charge of $229 million principally
    related to the premiums paid on the debt tendered.

Also in November 2010, the company made a tender offer for
    $200 million of Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial Revenue
    Bonds held by its subsidiary Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding, Inc.
    and maturing in 2028 with an interest rate of 4.55 percent.
    Approximately $178 million in aggregate principal amount
    was purchased for a total price of $178 million (including
    accrued and unpaid interest on the securities). The company also
    recorded a pre-tax charge of $2 million principally related
    to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.

Debt Issuance

– In November 2010, the company
    issued $500 million of

5-year,

$700 million of

10-year,

and
    $300 million of

30-year

unsecured senior obligations. Interest on the notes is payable
    semi-annually in arrears at fixed rates of 1.85 percent,
    3.50 percent, and 5.05 percent per annum, and the
    notes will mature on November 15, 2015, March 15, 2021
    and November 15, 2040, respectively. These senior notes are
    subject to redemption at the company’s discretion at any
    time prior to maturity in whole or in part at the principal
    amount plus any make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid
    interest. The net proceeds from these notes are being

-86-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

used for general corporate purposes including debt repayment,
    pension plan funding, acquisitions, share repurchases and
    working capital. A portion of the net proceeds was used to fund
    the purchase of the debt securities and bonds tendered and
    accepted for purchase in November 2010 as discussed above. The
    net proceeds may also be used to repay at maturity the
    $750 million of 7.125 percent senior notes due
    February 15, 2011.

In July 2009, the company issued $350 million of

5-year

and
    $500 million of

10-year

unsecured senior obligations. Interest on the notes is payable
    semi-annually in arrears at fixed rates of 3.70 percent and
    5.05 percent per annum, and the notes will mature on
    August 1, 2014, and August 1, 2019, respectively.
    These senior notes are subject to redemption at the
    company’s discretion at any time prior to maturity in whole
    or in part at the principal amount plus any make-whole premium
    and accrued and unpaid interest. The net proceeds from these
    notes were used for general corporate purposes including debt
    repayment, acquisitions, share repurchases, pension plan
    funding, and working capital. On October 15, 2009, a
    portion of the net proceeds was used to retire $400 million
    of 8 percent senior debt that had matured.

Long-term debt consisted of the following:

INVESTIGATIONS,
    CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

U.S. Government Investigations and
    Claims

– Departments and agencies of the
    U.S. Government have the authority to investigate various
    transactions and operations of the company, and the results of
    such investigations may lead to administrative, civil or
    criminal proceedings, the ultimate outcome of which could be
    fines, penalties, repayments or compensatory or treble damages.
    U.S. Government regulations provide that certain findings
    against

-87-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from future
    U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export privileges
    for a company or a division or subdivision. Suspension or
    debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company
    because of its reliance on government contracts.

In the second quarter of 2007, the U.S. Coast Guard issued
    a revocation of acceptance under the Deepwater Modernization
    Program for eight converted 123-foot patrol boats (the vessels)
    based on alleged “hull buckling and shaft alignment
    problems” and alleged “nonconforming topside
    equipment” on the vessels. The company submitted a written
    response that argued that the revocation of acceptance was
    improper. The Coast Guard advised Integrated Coast Guard
    Systems, LLC (ICGS), which was formed by the contractors
    (Lockheed Martin Corporation and Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding,
    Inc.) to perform the Deepwater Modernization Program, that it
    was seeking approximately $96 million from ICGS as a result
    of the revocation of acceptance. The majority of the costs
    associated with the 123-foot conversion effort are associated
    with the alleged structural deficiencies of the vessels, which
    were converted under contracts with the company and a
    subcontractor to the company. In 2008, the Coast Guard advised
    ICGS that the Coast Guard would support an investigation by the
    U.S. Department of Justice of ICGS and its subcontractors
    instead of pursuing its $96 million claim independently.
    The Department of Justice conducted an investigation of ICGS
    under a sealed False Claims Act complaint filed in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas and
    decided in early 2009 not to intervene at that time. On
    February 12, 2009, the District Court unsealed the
    complaint filed by Michael J. DeKort, a former Lockheed Martin
    employee, against ICGS, Lockheed Martin Corporation and the
    company relating to the 123-foot conversion effort. Damages
    under the False Claims Act are subject to trebling. On
    October 27, 2010, the District Court entered summary
    judgment for the company on the hull, mechanical and electrical
    (“HM&E”) claims brought against the company. On
    November 10, 2010, DeKort acknowledged that with the
    dismissal of the HM&E claims, no issues remained against
    the company for trial and the District Court subsequently
    vacated the December 1, 2010 trial date. On
    November 12, 2010, DeKort filed a motion for
    reconsideration regarding the District Court’s denial of
    his motion to amend the Fifth Amended Complaint. On
    November 19, 2010, DeKort filed a second motion for
    reconsideration regarding the District Court’s order
    granting summary judgment on the HM&E claims. Based upon
    the information available to the company to date, the company
    believes that it has substantive defenses to any potential
    claims but can give no assurance that the company will prevail
    in this litigation.

In August 2008, the company disclosed to the Antitrust Division
    of the Department of Justice possible violations of federal
    antitrust laws in connection with the bidding process for
    certain maintenance contracts at a military installation in
    California. In February 2009, the company and the Department of
    Justice signed an agreement admitting the company into the
    Corporate Leniency Program. As a result of the company’s
    acceptance into the Program, the company will be exempt from
    federal criminal prosecution and criminal fines relating to the
    matters the company reported to the Department of Justice if the
    company complies with certain conditions, including its
    continued cooperation with the government’s investigation
    and its agreement to make restitution if the government was
    harmed by the violations.

Based upon the available information regarding matters listed
    above that are subject to U.S. Government investigations,
    the company believes that the outcome of any such matters would
    not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Litigation

– Various claims and legal
    proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business and are
    pending against the company and its properties.

The company is one of several defendants in litigation brought
    by the Orange County Water District in Orange County Superior
    Court in California on December 17, 2004, for alleged
    contribution to volatile organic chemical contamination of the
    County’s shallow groundwater. The lawsuit includes counts
    against the defendants for violation of the Orange County Water
    District Act, the California Super Fund Act, negligence,
    nuisance, trespass and declaratory relief. Among other things,
    the lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for the cost of

-88-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

remediation, payment of attorney fees and costs, and punitive
    damages. The June 2009 trial date was vacated. The litigation
    has been stayed until the next scheduled status conference,
    which has been set for May 19, 2011.

On March 27, 2007, the U.S. District Court for the
    Central District of California consolidated two Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) lawsuits that had been
    separately filed on September 28, 2006, and January 3,
    2007, into In Re Northrop Grumman Corporation ERISA Litigation.
    The plaintiffs filed a consolidated Amended Complaint on
    September 15, 2010, alleging breaches of fiduciary duties
    by the Administrative Committees and the Investment Committees
    (as well as certain individuals who served on or supported those
    Committees) for two 401K Plans sponsored by Northrop Grumman
    Corporation. The company is not a defendant in the lawsuit. The
    plaintiffs claim that these alleged breaches of fiduciary duties
    caused the Plans to incur excessive administrative and
    investment fees and expenses to the detriment of the Plans’
    participants. On August 6, 2007, the District Court denied
    plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, and the
    plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s decision on class
    certification to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
    Circuit. On September 8, 2009, the Ninth Circuit vacated
    the Order denying class certification and remanded the issue to
    the District Court for further consideration. As required by the
    Ninth Circuit’s Order, the case was also reassigned to a
    different judge. The plaintiffs’ renewed motion for class
    certification was rejected on a procedural technicality, and
    they re-filed on January 14, 2011. The District Court
    postponed the trial date of April 12, 2011, to an as yet
    undetermined date pending resolution of the class certification
    motion as well as summary judgment motions, which are to be
    filed by May 2, 2011. Based upon the information available
    to the company to date, the company believes that it has
    substantive defenses to any potential claims but can give no
    assurance that the company will prevail in this litigation.

On June 22, 2007, a putative class action was filed against
    the Northrop Grumman Pension Plan and the Northrop Grumman
    Retirement Plan B and their corresponding administrative
    committees, styled as

Skinner et al. v. Northrop Grumman
    Pension Plan, etc., et al.,

in the U.S. District Court
    for the Central District of California. The putative class
    representatives alleged violations of ERISA and breaches of
    fiduciary duty concerning a 2003 modification to the Northrop
    Grumman Retirement Plan B. The modification relates to the
    employer funded portion of the pension benefit available during
    a five-year transition period that ended on June 30, 2008.
    The plaintiffs dismissed the Northrop Grumman Pension Plan, and
    in 2008 the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of
    all remaining defendants on all claims. The plaintiffs appealed,
    and in May 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
    Circuit reversed the decision of the District Court and remanded
    the matter back to the District Court for further proceedings,
    finding that there was ambiguity in a 1998 summary plan
    description related to the employer-funded component of the
    pension benefit. After the remand, the plaintiffs filed a motion
    to certify a class. The parties also filed cross-motions for
    summary judgment. On January 26, 2010, the District Court
    granted summary judgment in favor of the Plan and denied
    plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. The District Court
    also denied plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and
    struck the trial date of March 23, 2010 as unnecessary
    given the District Court’s grant of summary judgment for
    the Plan. Plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s order to
    the Ninth Circuit.

Based upon the information available, the company believes that
    the resolution of any of these claims and legal proceedings
    listed above would not have a material adverse effect on its
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Hurricane Katrina Insurance Recoveries

– The
    company is pursuing legal action against an insurance provider,
    Factory Mutual Insurance Company (FM Global), arising out of a
    disagreement concerning the coverage of certain losses related
    to Hurricane Katrina (Katrina) (see Note 16). Legal action
    commenced against FM Global

-89-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

on November 4, 2005, which is now pending in the
    U.S. District Court for the Central District of California,
    Western Division. In August 2007, the District Court issued an
    order finding that the excess insurance policy provided coverage
    for the company’s Katrina-related loss. FM Global appealed
    the District Court’s order and on August 14, 2008, the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the
    earlier summary judgment order in favor of the company’s
    interest, holding that the FM Global excess policy unambiguously
    excludes damage from the storm surge caused by Katrina under its
    “Flood” exclusion. The Ninth Circuit remanded the case
    to the District Court to determine whether the California
    efficient proximate cause doctrine affords the company coverage
    under the policy even if the Flood exclusion of the policy is
    unambiguous. On April 2, 2009, the Ninth Circuit denied the
    company’s Petition for Rehearing and remanded the case to
    the District Court. On June 10, 2009, the company filed a
    motion seeking leave of court to file a complaint adding Aon
    Risk Services, Inc. of Southern California (Aon) as a defendant.
    On July 1, 2009, FM Global filed a motion for partial
    summary judgment seeking a determination that the California
    efficient proximate cause doctrine is not applicable or that it
    affords no coverage under the policy. On August 26, 2010,
    the District Court denied the company’s motion to add Aon
    as a defendant to the case pending in the District Court,
    finding that the company has a viable option to bring suit
    against Aon in state court. Also on August 26, the District
    Court granted FM Global’s motion for summary judgment based
    upon California’s doctrine of efficient proximate cause,
    and denied FM Global’s motion for summary judgment based
    upon breach of contract, finding that triable issues of fact
    remained as to whether and to what extent Northrop Grumman
    sustained wind damage apart from the storm surge. The company
    believes that it is entitled to full reimbursement of its
    covered losses under the excess policy. The District Court has
    scheduled trial on the merits for April 3, 2012. On
    January 27, 2011, the company filed an action against Aon
    Insurance Services West, Inc., formerly known as Aon Risk
    Services, Inc. of Southern California in Superior Court in
    California alleging breach of contract, professional negligence,
    and negligent misrepresentation. Based on the current status of
    the litigation, no assurances can be made as to the ultimate
    outcome of these matters; however, if the company is successful
    in either of its claims, the potential impact to the
    company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows would be favorable.

During 2008, the company received notification from

Munich-American

Risk Partners (Munich Re), the only remaining insurer within the
    primary layer of insurance coverage with which a resolution has
    not been reached, that it will pursue arbitration proceedings
    against the company related to approximately $19 million
    owed by Munich Re to Northrop Grumman Risk Management Inc.
    (NGRMI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, for certain
    losses related to Katrina. An arbitration was later invoked by
    Munich Re in the United Kingdom under the reinsurance contract.
    The company was subsequently notified that Munich Re is seeking
    reimbursement of approximately $44 million of funds
    previously advanced to NGRMI for payment of claim losses of
    which Munich Re provided reinsurance protection to NGRMI
    pursuant to an executed reinsurance contract, and
    $6 million of adjustment expenses. The arbitral panel has
    set a hearing for November 14, 2011. The company believes
    that NGRMI is entitled to full reimbursement of its covered
    losses under the reinsurance contract and has substantive
    defenses to the claim of Munich Re for return of the funds paid
    to date. If matters are resolved in NGRMI’s favor, then
    NGRMI would be entitled to the remaining $19 million owed
    for covered losses and it would have no further obligations to
    Munich Re. Payments to be made to NGRMI in connection with this
    matter would be for the benefit of the company and
    reimbursements to be made to Munich Re would be made by the
    company, if any.

Subsequent Event

– On January 31, 2011,
    the U.S. Department of Justice first informed the company
    and Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding, Inc. of a False Claims Act
    complaint that the company believes was filed under seal by a
    relator in mid-2010 in the United States District Court for the
    District of Columbia. The redacted copy of the complaint that
    the company received alleges that through largely unspecified
    fraudulent means the company obtained federal funds that were
    restricted by law for the consequences of Katrina, and used
    those funds to cover costs under certain shipbuilding contracts
    that were unrelated to Katrina and for which the company was not
    entitled to recovery under the contracts. The complaint seeks
    monetary damages of at least $835 million, plus penalties,
    attorney’s fees and other costs of suit. Damages under the
    False Claims Act may be trebled upon a finding of liability.

-90-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

For several years, the company has pursued recovery under its
    insurance policies for Katrina related property damage and
    business interruption losses. One of the insurers involved in
    those actions has made allegations that overlap significantly
    with certain of the issues raised in the complaint, including
    allegations that the company used certain Katrina related funds
    for losses under the contracts unrelated to the hurricane. The
    company believes that the insurer’s defenses, including
    those related to the use of Katrina funding, are without merit.

The company has agreed to cooperate with the government
    investigation relating to the False Claims Act complaint. The
    company has been advised that the Department of Justice has not
    made a decision whether to intervene. Based upon the information
    available to the company to date, the company believes it has
    substantive defenses to the allegations in the complaint but can
    give no assurance that there will be no material adverse impact
    on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows
    from this matter.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Contract Performance Contingencies

– Contract
    profit margins may include estimates of revenues not
    contractually agreed to between the customer and the company for
    matters such as settlements in the process of negotiation,
    contract changes, claims and requests for equitable adjustment
    for previously unanticipated contract costs. These estimates are
    based upon management’s best assessment of the underlying
    causal events and circumstances, and are included in determining
    contract profit margins to the extent of expected recovery based
    on contractual entitlements and the probability of successful
    negotiation with the customer. As of December 31, 2010, the
    recognized amounts related to claims and requests for equitable
    adjustment are not material individually or in the aggregate.

Guarantees of Subsidiary Performance
    Obligations

– From time to time in the ordinary
    course of business, the company guarantees performance
    obligations of its subsidiaries under certain contracts. In
    addition, the company’s subsidiaries may enter into joint
    ventures, teaming and other business arrangements (collectively,
    Business Arrangements) to support the company’s products
    and services in domestic and international markets. The company
    generally strives to limit its exposure under these arrangements
    to its subsidiary’s investment in the Business
    Arrangements, or to the extent of such subsidiary’s
    obligations under the applicable contract. In some cases,
    however, the company may be required to guarantee performance by
    the Business Arrangements and, in such cases, the company
    generally obtains cross-indemnification from the other members
    of the Business Arrangements. At December 31, 2010, the
    company is not aware of any existing event of default that would
    require it to satisfy any of these guarantees.

Environmental Matters

– The estimated cost to
    complete remediation has been accrued where it is probable that
    the company will incur such costs in the future to address
    environmental impacts at currently or formerly owned or leased
    operating facilities, or at sites where it has been named a
    Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the Environmental
    Protection Agency, or similarly designated by other
    environmental agencies. These accruals do not include any
    litigation costs related to environmental matters, nor do they
    include amounts recorded as asset retirement obligations. To
    assess the potential impact on the company’s consolidated
    financial statements, management estimates the range of
    reasonably possible remediation costs that could be incurred by
    the company, taking into account currently available facts on
    each site as well as the current state of technology and prior
    experience in remediating contaminated sites. These estimates
    are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect changes in
    facts and technical and legal circumstances. Management
    estimates that as of December 31, 2010, the range of
    reasonably possible future costs for environmental remediation
    sites is $280 million to $674 million, of which
    $109 million is accrued in other current liabilities and
    $207 million is accrued in other long-term liabilities. A
    portion of the environmental remediation costs is expected to be
    recoverable through overhead charges on government contracts
    and, accordingly, such amounts are deferred in inventoried costs
    (current portion) and miscellaneous other assets (non-current
    portion). Factors that could result in changes to the
    company’s estimates include: modification of planned
    remedial actions, increases or decreases in the estimated time
    required to remediate, changes to the determination of legally
    responsible parties, discovery of more extensive contamination
    than anticipated, changes in laws and regulations affecting
    remediation requirements, and

-91-

improvements in remediation technology. Should other PRPs not
    pay their allocable share of remediation costs, the company may
    have to incur costs in addition to those already estimated and
    accrued. In addition, there are some potential remediation sites
    where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated.
    Although management cannot predict whether new information
    gained as projects progress will materially affect the estimated
    liability accrued, management does not anticipate that future
    remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on
    the company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Hurricane Impacts –

In 2008, a
    subcontractor’s operations in Texas were severely impacted
    by Hurricane Ike. The subcontractor produces compartments for
    two of the LPD amphibious transport dock ships under
    construction at the Gulf Coast shipyards. In 2009, the company
    received $25 million of insurance proceeds representing
    interim payments for property damages on the Hurricane Ike
    insurance claim. In 2010, the company received $17 million
    in final settlement of its claim and recorded the insurance
    proceeds as operating income at the Shipbuilding segment.

In August 2005, the company’s Gulf Coast operations were
    significantly impacted by Katrina and the company’s
    shipyards in Louisiana and Mississippi sustained significant
    windstorm damage from the hurricane. As a result of the storm,
    the company incurred costs to replace or repair destroyed or
    damaged assets, suffered losses under its contracts, and
    incurred substantial costs to clean up and recover its
    operations. As of the date of the storm, the company had a
    comprehensive insurance program that provided coverage for,
    among other things, property damage, business interruption
    impact on net profitability, and costs associated with

clean-up

and
    recovery. The company expects that its remaining claims will be
    resolved separately with the two remaining insurers, FM Global
    and Munich Re (see Note 15).

The company has full entitlement to any insurance recoveries
    related to business interruption impacts on net profitability
    resulting from these hurricanes. However, because of
    uncertainties concerning the ultimate determination of
    recoveries related to business interruption claims, no such
    amounts are recognized until they are resolved with the
    insurers. Furthermore, due to the uncertainties with respect to
    the company’s disagreement with FM Global in relation to
    the Katrina claim, no receivables have been recognized by the
    company in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
    for insurance recoveries from FM Global.

In accordance with U.S. Government cost accounting
    regulations affecting the majority of the company’s
    contracts, the cost of insurance premiums for property damage
    and business interruption coverage, other than “coverage of
    profit,” is an allowable expense that may be charged to
    contracts. Because a substantial portion of long-term contracts
    at the shipyards are flexibly-priced, the government customer
    would benefit from a portion of insurance recoveries in excess
    of the net book value of damaged assets. When such insurance
    recoveries occur, the company is obligated to provide the
    benefit of a portion of these amounts to the government. In
    recent discussions, the U.S. Navy has expressed its
    intention to challenge the allowability of certain post-Katrina
    depreciation costs charged or expected to be charged on
    contracts under construction in the Gulf Coast shipyards. It is
    premature to estimate the amount, if any, that the
    U.S. Navy will ultimately challenge. The company believes
    all of the replacement costs should be recoverable under its
    insurance coverage and the amounts that may be challenged are
    included in the insurance claim. However, if the company is
    unsuccessful in its insurance recovery, the company believes
    there are specific rules in the CAS and FAR that should still
    render the depreciation on those assets allowable and
    recoverable through its contracts with the U.S. Navy as
    these replacement costs provide benefit to the government. The
    company believes that its depreciation practices are in
    conformity with the FAR, and that, if the U.S. Navy were to
    challenge the allowability of such costs, the company would be
    able to successfully resolve this matter with no material
    adverse impact to the company’s consolidated financial
    position or results of operations.

Shipbuilding Quality Issues

– In conjunction
    with a second quarter 2009 review of design, engineering and
    production processes at Shipbuilding undertaken as a result of
    leaks discovered in the USS San Antonio’s
    (LPD 17) lube oil system, the company became aware of
    quality issues relating to certain pipe welds on ships under
    production in the Gulf Coast as well as those that had
    previously been delivered. Since that discovery, the

-92-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

company has been working with its customer to determine the
    nature and extent of the pipe weld issue and its possible impact
    on related shipboard systems. This effort has resulted in the
    preparation of a technical analysis of the problem, additional
    inspections on the ships, a rework plan for ships previously
    delivered and in various stages of production, and modifications
    to the work plans for ships being placed into production, all of
    which has been done with the knowledge and support of the
    U.S. Navy. Incremental costs associated with the
    anticipated resolution of these matters, and determined to be
    Shipbuilding’s responsibility, have been reflected in the
    financial performance analysis and contract booking rates
    beginning with the second quarter of 2009.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, certain bearing wear and debris
    were found in the lubrication system of the main propulsion
    diesel engines (MPDE) installed on LPD 21. Shipbuilding is
    participating with the U.S. Navy and other industry
    participants involved with the MPDEs in a review panel
    established by the U.S. Navy to examine the MPDE
    lubrication system’s design, construction, operation and
    maintenance for the LPD 17 class of ships. The team is focusing
    on identification and understanding of the root causes of the
    MPDE diesel bearing wear and debris in the lubrication system
    and the potential future impacts on maintenance costs. To date
    the review has identified several potential system improvements
    for increasing the system reliability. Certain changes are being
    implemented on ships under construction at this time and the
    U.S. Navy is implementing some changes on in-service ships
    in the class at the earliest opportunity. The U.S. Navy has
    requested a special MPDE flush procedure be used on LPDs 22
    through 25 under construction at the Gulf Coast shipyards. The
    company has informed the U.S. Navy of its position that
    should the U.S. Navy direct use of this new flush
    procedure, the company believes such direction would be a change
    to the contracts for all LPDs under construction, and that such
    a change would entitle the company to an equitable adjustment to
    cover the cost and schedule impacts. However, the company can
    give no assurance that the U.S. Navy will agree that any
    such direction would constitute a contract change.

In July 2010, the Navy released its report documenting the
    results of a Judge Advocate General’s manual (JAGMAN)
    investigation of the failure of MPDE bearings on LPD 17
    subsequent to the Navy’s Planned Maintenance Availability
    (PMA), which was completed in October 2009. During sea trials
    following the completion of the Navy conducted PMA, one of the
    ship’s MPDEs suffered a casualty as the result of a bearing
    failure. The JAGMAN investigation determined that the bearing
    failure could be attributed to a number of possible factors,
    including deficiencies in the acquisition process, maintenance,
    training, and execution of shipboard programs, as well as debris
    from the construction process. Shipbuilding’s technical
    personnel reviewed the JAGMAN report and provided feedback to
    the Navy on the report, recommending that the company and the
    Navy perform a comprehensive review of the LPD 17 Class
    propulsion system design and its associated operation and
    maintenance procedure in order to enhance reliability.
    Discussions between the company and the Navy on this
    recommendation are ongoing.

The company and the U.S. Navy continue to work in
    partnership to investigate and identify any additional
    corrective actions to address quality issues associated with
    ships manufactured in the company’s Gulf Coast shipyards,
    and the company will implement appropriate corrective actions.
    The company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of the
    matters described above will have a material adverse effect upon
    its consolidated financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

The company has also encountered various quality issues on its
    aircraft carrier construction and overhaul programs and its

Virginia

-class submarine construction program at its
    Newport News shipyards. These primarily involve matters related
    to filler metal used in pipe welds identified in 2007, and in
    2009, issues associated with non-nuclear weld inspection and the
    installation of weapons handling equipment on certain
    submarines, and certain purchased material quality issues. The
    company does not believe that resolution of these issues will
    have a material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Financial Arrangements

– In the ordinary course
    of business, the company uses standby letters of credit and
    guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued
    principally by insurance companies to guarantee the performance
    on certain contracts and to support the company’s
    self-insured workers’ compensation plans. At

-93-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

December 31, 2010, there were $303 million of stand-by
    letters of credit, $192 million of bank guarantees, and
    $446 million of surety bonds outstanding.

The company has also guaranteed the remaining $22 million
    of bonds outstanding from the Gulf Opportunity Zone Industrial
    Revenue Development Bonds issued by the Mississippi Business
    Finance Corporation in December 2006. Under the guaranty, the
    company guaranteed the repayment of all payments due under the
    trust indenture and loan agreement. In addition, a subsidiary of
    the company has guaranteed Shipbuilding’s outstanding
    $84 million Economic Development Revenue Bonds (Ingalls
    Shipbuilding, Inc. Project), Taxable Series 1999A.

Indemnifications

– The company has retained
    certain warranty, environmental, income tax, and other potential
    liabilities in connection with certain of its divestitures. The
    settlement of these liabilities is not expected to have a
    material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

U.S. Government Claims

– From time to
    time, customers advise the company of claims and penalties
    concerning certain potential disallowed costs. When such
    findings are presented, the company and the U.S. Government
    representatives engage in discussions to enable the company to
    evaluate the merits of these claims as well as to assess the
    amounts being claimed. Where appropriate, provisions are made to
    reflect the company’s expected exposure to the matters
    raised by the U.S. Government representatives and such
    provisions are reviewed on a quarterly basis for sufficiency
    based on the most recent information available. The company
    believes that the outcome of any such matters would not have a
    material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Operating Leases

– Rental expense for operating
    leases, excluding discontinued operations, was $492 million
    in 2010, $549 million in 2009, and $567 million in
    2008. These amounts are net of immaterial amounts of sublease
    rental income. Minimum rental commitments under long-term
    noncancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2010,
    total approximately $1.5 billion, which are payable as
    follows: 2011 – $367 million; 2012 –
    $289 million; 2013 – $210 million;
    2014 – $181 million; 2015 –
    $149 million and thereafter – $318 million.

Related Party Transactions

– For all periods
    presented, the company had no material related party
    transactions.

RETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

Plan
    Descriptions

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

– The company
    sponsors several defined benefit pension plans in the
    U.S. covering the majority of its employees. Pension
    benefits for most employees are based on the employee’s
    years of service and compensation. It is the policy of the
    company to fund at least the minimum amount required for all
    qualified plans, using actuarial cost methods and assumptions
    acceptable under U.S. Government regulations, by making
    payments into benefit trusts separate from the company. The
    pension benefit for most employees is based upon criteria
    whereby employees earn age and service points over their
    employment period.

Defined Contribution Plans

– The company also
    sponsors 401(k) defined contribution plans in which most
    employees are eligible to participate, as well as certain
    bargaining unit employees. Company contributions for most plans
    are based on a cash matching of employee contributions up to
    4 percent of compensation. Certain hourly employees are
    covered under a target benefit plan. The company also
    participates in a multiemployer plan for certain of the
    company’s union employees. In addition to the 401(k)
    defined contribution benefit, non-represented employees hired
    after June 30, 2008, are eligible to participate in a
    defined contribution program in lieu of a defined benefit
    pension plan. The company’s contributions to these defined
    contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009, and 2008, were $338 million, $341 million, and
    $311 million, respectively.

Non-U.S. Benefit

Plans –

The company sponsors several benefit plans
    for

non-U.S. employees.

These plans are designed to provide benefits appropriate to
    local practice and in accordance with local regulations. Some of
    these plans are funded using benefit trusts that are separate
    from the company.

NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Medical and Life Benefits

– The company
    provides a portion of the costs for certain health care and life
    insurance benefits for a substantial number of its active and
    retired employees. Covered employees achieve eligibility to
    participate in these contributory plans upon retirement from
    active service if they meet specified age and years of service
    requirements. Qualifying dependents are also eligible for
    medical coverage. Approximately 64 percent of the
    company’s current retirees participate in the medical
    plans. The company reserves the right to amend or terminate the
    plans at any time. In November 2006, the company adopted plan
    amendments and communicated to plan participants that it would
    cap the amount of its contributions to substantially all of its
    remaining post retirement medical and life benefit plans that
    were previously not subject to limits on the company’s
    contributions.

In addition to a medical inflation cost-sharing feature, the
    plans also have provisions for deductibles,

co-payments,

coinsurance percentages,

out-of-pocket

limits, conformance to a schedule of reasonable fees, the use of
    managed care providers, and maintenance of benefits with other
    plans. The plans also provide for a Medicare carve-out.
    Subsequent to January 1, 2005 (or earlier at some
    segments), newly hired employees are not eligible for post
    employment medical and life benefits.

The effect of the Medicare prescription drug subsidy from the
    Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
    2003 to reduce the company’s net periodic post-retirement
    benefit cost and accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation
    for the periods presented was not material. Pursuant to the new
    healthcare law described below, the tax benefits related to
    Medicare Part D subsidies will expire on December 31,
    2012.

New Health Care Legislation

– The Patient
    Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and
    Education Reconciliation Act became law during the first quarter
    of 2010. The provisions of these new laws will affect the
    company’s costs of providing health care benefits to its
    employees beginning in 2011. The company participated in the
    Early Retiree Reinsurance Program and continues to assess the
    extent to which the provisions of the new laws will affect its
    future health care and related employee benefit plan costs.

Unamortized benefit plan costs consist primarily of accumulated
    net after-tax actuarial losses totaling $2,771 million and
    $3,082 million as of December 31, 2010, and 2009,
    respectively. Net actuarial gains or losses are re-determined
    annually and principally arise from gains or losses on plan
    assets due to variations in the fair market value of the
    underlying assets and changes in the benefit obligation due to
    changes in actuarial assumptions. Net actuarial gains or losses
    are amortized to expense in future periods when they exceed ten
    percent of the greater of plan assets or projected benefit
    obligations by benefit plan. The excess of gains or losses over
    the ten percent threshold are subject to amortization over the
    average future service period of employees of approximately ten
    years.

The discount rate is generally based on the yield on
    high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of
    each year, the discount rate is primarily determined using the
    results of bond yield curve models based on a portfolio of high
    quality bonds matching the notional cash inflows with the
    expected benefit payments for each significant benefit plan.

The assumptions used for pension benefits are consistent with
    those used for retiree medical and life insurance benefits. The
    long-term rate of return on plan assets used for the medical and
    life benefits are reduced to allow for the impact of tax on
    expected returns as, unlike the pension trust, the earnings of
    certain Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts
    are taxable.

Through consultation with investment advisors, expected
    long-term returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset
    classes were developed. Several factors were considered,
    including survey of investment managers’ expectations,
    current market data such as yields/price-earnings ratios, and
    historical market returns over long periods. Using policy target
    allocation percentages and the asset class expected returns, a
    weighted-average expected return was calculated.

Plan
    Assets and Investment Policy

Plan assets are invested in various asset classes that are
    expected to produce a sufficient level of diversification and
    investment return over the long term. The investment goal is to
    exceed the assumed actuarial rate of return over the long term
    within reasonable and prudent levels of risk. Liability studies
    are conducted on a regular basis to provide guidance in setting
    investment goals with an objective to balance risk. Risk targets
    are established and monitored against acceptable ranges.

All investment policies and procedures are designed to ensure
    that the plans’ investments are in compliance with ERISA.
    Guidelines are established defining permitted investments within
    each asset class. Derivatives are used for transitioning assets,
    asset class rebalancing, managing currency risk, and for
    management of fixed income and alternative investments. For the
    majority of the plans’ assets, the investment policies
    require that the asset allocation be maintained within the
    following ranges as of December 31, 2010:

Asset Allocation Ranges

Domestic equities

10% – 30%

International equities

10% – 30%

Fixed income securities

30% – 50%

Real estate and other

10% – 30%

The table below provides the fair values of the company’s
    pension and VEBA trust plan assets at December 31, 2010,
    and 2009, by asset category. The table also identifies the level
    of inputs used to determine the fair value of assets in each
    category (see Note 1 for definition of levels). The
    significant amount of Level 2 investments in the table
    results from including in this category investments in pooled
    funds that contain investments with values

Generally, investments are valued based on information in
    financial publications of general circulation, statistical and
    valuation services, records of security exchanges, appraisal by
    qualified persons, transactions and bona fide offers. Domestic
    and international equities consist primarily of common stocks
    and institutional common trust funds. Investments in common and
    preferred shares are valued at the last reported sales price of
    the stock on the

-100-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

last business day of the reporting period. Units in common trust
    funds and hedge funds are valued based on the redemption price
    of units owned by the trusts at year-end. Fair value for real
    estate and private equity partnerships is primarily based on
    valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals,
    comparable transactions, discounted cash flow valuation models,
    and public market data.

Non-government fixed income securities are invested across
    various industry sectors and credit quality ratings. Generally,
    investment guidelines are written to limit securities, for
    example, to no more than 5 percent of each trust account,
    and to exclude the purchase of securities issued by the company.
    The number of real estate and private equity partnerships is 167
    and the unfunded commitments are $1.2 billion and
    $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2010, and 2009,
    respectively. For alternative investments that cannot be
    redeemed, such as limited partnerships, the typical investment
    term is ten years. For alternative investments that permit
    redemptions, such redemptions are generally made quarterly and
    require a

90-day

notice. The company is generally unable to determine the final
    redemption amount until the request is processed by the
    investment fund and therefore categorizes such alternative
    investments as Level 3 assets.

At December 31, 2010, and 2009, the defined benefit pension
    and VEBA trusts did not hold any Northrop Grumman common stock.

In 2011, the company expects to contribute the required minimum
    funding level of approximately $62 million to its pension
    plans and approximately $160 million to its other
    post-retirement benefit plans and also expects to make
    additional voluntary pension contributions of approximately
    $500 million. During 2010 and 2009, the company made
    voluntary pension contributions of $830 million and
    $800 million, respectively.

STOCK
    COMPENSATION PLANS

Plan
    Descriptions

At December 31, 2010, Northrop Grumman had stock-based
    compensation awards outstanding under the following plans: the
    2001 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (2001 LTISP) applicable to
    employees, and the 1993 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors
    (1993 SPND) and 1995 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (1995
    SPND) as amended. All of these plans were approved by the
    company’s shareholders. The company has historically issued
    new shares to satisfy award grants.

Employee Plans

– The 2001 LTISP permits grants
    to key employees of three general types of stock incentive
    awards: stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), and
    stock awards. Each stock option grant is made with an exercise
    price either at the closing price of the stock on the date of
    grant (market options) or at a premium over the closing price of
    the stock on the date of grant (premium options). Outstanding
    stock options granted prior to 2008 generally vest in
    25 percent increments over four years from the grant date,
    and grants outstanding expire ten years after the grant date.
    Stock options granted 2008 and later vest in 33 percent
    increments over three years from the grant date and grants
    outstanding expire seven years after the grant date. No SARs
    have

-101-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

been granted under the LTISP. Stock awards, in the form of
    restricted performance stock rights and restricted stock rights,
    are granted to key employees without payment to the company.

Recipients of restricted performance stock rights earn shares of
    stock, based on financial metrics determined by the board of
    directors in accordance with the plan. For grants prior to 2007,
    if the objectives have not been met at the end of the applicable
    performance period, up to 100 percent of the original grant
    for the eight highest compensated employees and up to
    70 percent of the original grant for all other recipients
    will be forfeited. If the financial metrics are met or exceeded
    during the performance period, all recipients can earn up to
    150 percent of the original grant. Beginning in 2007, all
    members of the Corporate Policy Council (consisting of the CEO
    and certain other leadership positions) could forfeit up to
    100 percent of the original grant, and all recipients could
    earn up to 200 percent of the original grant. Restricted
    stock rights issued under either plan generally vest after three
    years. Termination of employment can result in forfeiture of
    some or all of the benefits extended. Of the 50 million
    shares approved for issuance under the 2001 LTISP, approximately
    9.4 million shares were available for future grants as of
    December 31, 2010.

Non-Employee Plans

– Under the 1993 SPND, at
    least half of the retainer fee earned by each director must be
    deferred into a stock unit account (Automatic Stock Units).
    Effective January 1, 2010, the amended SPND provides that
    the Automatic Stock Units be awarded at the conclusion of board
    service or as specified by the director. If a director has less
    than 5 years of service, the stock units are awarded at the
    conclusion of board service. In addition, directors may defer
    payment of all or part of the remaining retainer fee and other
    annual committee fees, which are placed in a stock unit account
    (Elective Stock Units). The Elective Stock Units are awarded at
    the conclusion of board service or as specified by the director,
    regardless of years of service. Directors are credited with
    dividend equivalents in connection with the stock units until
    the shares are awarded. The 1995 SPND provided for annual stock
    option grants, and effective June 1, 2005, no new grants
    have been issued from this plan. The 1995 SPND was amended in
    May 2007 to permit payment of the stock unit portion of the
    retainer fee described above. Each grant of stock options under
    the 1995 SPND was made at the closing market price on the date
    of the grant, was immediately exercisable, and expires ten years
    after the grant date. At December 31, 2010, approximately
    93 thousand shares were available for future grants under the
    1995 SPND.

Compensation
    Expense

Total stock-based compensation for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, was $134 million,
    $101 million, and $111 million, respectively, of which
    $27 million, $20 million, and $15 million related
    to stock options and $107 million, $81 million, and
    $96 million, related to stock awards, respectively. Tax
    benefits recognized in the consolidated statements of operations
    for stock-based compensation during the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, were $53 million,
    $40 million, and $44 million, respectively. In
    addition, the company realized tax benefits of $17 million
    from the exercise of stock options and $34 million from the
    issuance of stock awards in 2010.

At December 31, 2010, there was $172 million of
    unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested awards
    granted under the company’s stock-based compensation plans,
    of which $19 million relates to stock options and
    $153 million relates to stock awards. These amounts are
    expected to be charged to expense over a weighted-average period
    of 1.4 years.

Stock
    Options

The fair value of each of the company’s stock option awards
    is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the
    table below. The fair value of the company’s stock option
    awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
    period of the options, which is generally three to four years.
    Expected volatility is based on an average of
    (1) historical volatility of the company’s stock and
    (2) implied volatility from traded options on the
    company’s stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the
    contractual life of the stock option award is based on the yield
    curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the
    award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of
    the award. The company uses historical data to estimate future
    forfeitures. The expected term of awards granted is derived from
    historical

-102-


NORTHROP
    GRUMMAN CORPORATION

experience under the company’s stock-based compensation
    plans and represents the period of time that awards granted are
    expected to be outstanding.

The significant weighted-average assumptions relating to the
    valuation of the company’s stock options for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, was as follows:

The company generally granted stock options exclusively to
    executives, and the expected term of six years is based on these
    employees’ exercise behavior. In 2009, the company granted
    options to non-executives and assigned an expected term of five
    years for valuing these options. The company believes that this
    stratification of expected terms best represents future expected
    exercise behavior between the two employee groups.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options
    granted during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and
    2008, was $11, $7, and $15, per share, respectively.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, was
    $42 million, $11 million, and $66 million,
    respectively. Intrinsic value is measured using the fair market
    value at the date of exercise (for options exercised) or at
    December 31, 2010 (for outstanding options), less the
    applicable exercise price.

Stock
    Awards

The fair value of stock awards is determined based on the
    closing market price of the company’s common stock on the
    grant date. Compensation expense for stock awards is measured at
    the grant date based on fair value and recognized over the
    vesting period, generally three years. For purposes of measuring
    compensation expense, the number of shares ultimately expected
    to vest is estimated at each reporting date based on
    management’s expectations regarding the relevant
    performance criteria.

The company issued 1.3 million, 2.5 million, and
    2.9 million shares to employees in settlement of prior year
    stock awards that were fully vested, which had total fair values
    at issuance of $76 million, $111 million, and
    $233 million and grant date fair values of
    $91 million, $161 million, and $155 million
    during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008,
    respectively. The differences between the fair values at
    issuance and the grant date fair values reflect the effects of
    the performance adjustments and changes in the fair market value
    of the company’s common stock.

In 2011, the company expects to issue to employees
    1.3 million shares of common stock that vested as of
    December 31, 2010, with a grant date fair value of
    $101 million.

Unaudited quarterly financial results are set forth in the
    following tables. It is the company’s long-standing
    practice to establish actual interim closing dates using a
    “fiscal” calendar, which requires the businesses to
    close their books on a Friday, in order to normalize the
    potentially disruptive effects of quarterly close on business
    processes. The effects of this practice only exist within a
    reporting year. The company’s common stock is traded on the

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Northrop Grumman Corporation (the company)
    prepared and is responsible for the consolidated financial
    statements and all related financial information contained in
    this Annual Report. This responsibility includes establishing
    and maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting. The company’s internal control over financial
    reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
    the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

To comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the company designed and implemented
    a structured and comprehensive assessment process to evaluate
    its internal control over financial reporting across the
    enterprise. The assessment of the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Because of its
    inherent limitations, a system of internal control over
    financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and
    may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management regularly
    monitors its internal control over financial reporting, and
    actions are taken to correct any deficiencies as they are
    identified. Based on its assessment, management has concluded
    that the company’s internal control over financial
    reporting is effective as of December 31, 2010.

Deloitte & Touche LLP issued an attestation report
    dated February 8, 2011, concerning the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting, which is contained in
    this Annual Report. The company’s consolidated financial
    statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010,
    have been audited by the independent registered public
    accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States).

    criteria established in

Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 of the Company and our report dated
    February 8, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements.
